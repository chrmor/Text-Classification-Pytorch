'Waratte Iitomo!' wraps up after 32 years on air
TV personality Kazuyoshi Morita, better known as Tamori, signed off from his noontime show “Waratte Iitomo!” for the last time Monday after 32 years on the air.
On the 8,054th and final episode of the long-running Fuji Television Network program, Morita was given a certificate of merit by comedian and film director Takeshi Kitano.
At the end of the show, Tamori thanked the audience “for these 32 long years.”
Outside the studio in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district, where the show was being filmed, fans and passers-by watched the live broadcast as it aired on the giant monitor above Studio Alta.
“I used to often watch (the show) on days that school finished early,” said Tomomi Ueno, a high school student who was among the onlookers. “I’m sad to see it end.”
The show began in October 1982 and logged an audience-rating high of 27.9 percent in the Kanto region in April 1988, according to Video Research Ltd.
