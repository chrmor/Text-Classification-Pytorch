Volcanic Ash Forces Flight Cancellations in Europe
PARIS — Airlines canceled about 500 European flights on Tuesday as the ash cloud from the Grimsvotn volcano in Iceland drifted into northern Britain and Ireland, but a senior European official predicted that the disruption would not reach the scale of a year ago, when millions of travelers were inconvenienced.
“We are still looking at a very challenging week for passengers and for the airlines,” Siim Kallas, the European Union transportation commissioner, said in a statement. “Although we are partly dependent on the weather and the pattern of ash dispersion, we do not at this stage anticipate the widespread airspace closures and the prolonged disruption we saw last year.”
Eurocontrol, the agency based in Brussels that coordinates air traffic management across the region, said about 500 of 29,000 flights scheduled across Europe were canceled.
In London, the weather service’s Volcanic Ash Advisory Center warned that low-pressure systems expected across northern Britain this week mean “wind direction is likely to be quite variable,” making forecasting the progress of the cloud difficult.
The eruption led President Obama, in Europe on a six-day visit that will include a Group of 8 meeting in France, to shorten a visit to Ireland on Monday and fly to London a day early.
