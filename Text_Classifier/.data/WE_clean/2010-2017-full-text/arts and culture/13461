'Django Unchained' L.A. premiere canceled
Hollywood is taking a step back this week as the nation mourns the tragedy in Newtown, Conn.
The Weinstein Company canceled its premiere of Django Unchained in Los Angeles, following Paramount's decision to postpone its Jack Reacher premiere this coming Wednesday in Pittsburgh.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, CT and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event," said a spokesperson for The Weinstein Company on Monday. "However, we will be holding a private screening for the cast and crew and their friends and families."
The intense film, which follows Jamie Foxx as a former slave-turned-bounty hunter, was to premiere at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Tuesday in Beverly Hills. Director Quentin Tarantino, and Django stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Don Johnson, Walton Goggins, James Remar and Harvey Weinstein were expected to attend.
