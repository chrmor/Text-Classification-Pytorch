Two Munich Train Stations Evacuated Over Potential ISIS Threat
Police in Munich, Germany, evacuated two train stations during New Year's Eve celebrations — including the city's main station — because of a potential ISIS suicide threat, authorities said Friday.
"Due to serious evidence, the police in Munich are dealing with an active threat of a terror attack in the Munich area," police said in a post on Facebook asking people to avoid crowds. "Due to existing information which we take highly seriously, there is an attack planned tonight."
Police told NBC News separately that the main Munich Hauptbahnhof and Pasing train stations were evacuated. They were reopened before dawn Friday, Munich police said.
