Shell shelves refining at Clyde
Shell looks set to end its refining operations in NSW, labelling the Clyde refinery "no longer competitive" compared with new "mega-refineries" in Asia, which puts hundreds of jobs at risk.
Clyde and the Gore Bay Terminal in Greenwich, Sydney, will be turned into a fuel import terminal.
Employees were informed of the news this morning. Clyde refinery employs 310 staff, which would be reduced to between 30 and 50 staff to operate as a fuel import terminal.
Clyde produces 75,000 barrels of petrol a day. It is located where the Parramatta and Duck rivers join, 16 kilometres west of Sydney's CBD.
Along with Shell's other refinery, Geelong in Victoria, it supplies about 25 per cent of Australia's petrol needs.
Shell said it would replace output from the Clyde refinery, which supplies around 40 per cent of NSWâ€™s fuel needs, with imports from Asia.
