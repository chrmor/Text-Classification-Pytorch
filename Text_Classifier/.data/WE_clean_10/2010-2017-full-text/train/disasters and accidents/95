Eleven people are missing but no deaths have been confirmed after a massive landslide in a south-east Mexico town, after earlier reports suggested seven were dead and 100 missing.
The earlier casualty toll in Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec had been given by both the Oaxaca state governor and Mexico's president Felipe Calderon, who spoke with reporters as he flew over the heavily flooded regions of southern Mexico.
Rain was so heavy in the region that the president had to call off a scheduled landing in Tabasco's state capital, Villahermosa.
But it seems earlier fears of a significant death toll were unfounded.
"Happily, the casualty toll has changed, so much so that we can't even confirm any deaths," said interior minister Jose Francisco Blake after arriving in Oaxaca.
"Provisionally, we have 11 missing, including eight children and three adults," he added.
Oaxaca governor Ulises Ruiz initially told Mexican television the landslide buried between 100 and 300 homes and that thousands of people were affected in the region.
But local reporters visiting the site said only two homes appear to have been destroyed and 30 damaged by the landslide.
The remote village of 10,000 people sits 2,400 metres above sea level and remains inaccessible by road because of the landslides and by air because of the severe weather.
Some police and rescue workers have managed to reach the remote mountain village on foot.
Town secretary Donato Vargas said earlier that "residents of nearby villages came to help dig, many of them with their hands, trying to reach the buried houses".
Flooding and landslides have killed at least 80 people since May in Mexico, including in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, where Hurricane Karl left at least 14 people dead and an estimated 400,000 people homeless.
