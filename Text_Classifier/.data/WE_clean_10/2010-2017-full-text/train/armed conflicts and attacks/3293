Another Separatist Fighter Killed In Breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh
De facto officials of the Armenian-backed breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region said on April 27 that another soldier from separatist forces was killed overnight by Azerbaijani troops.
The separatist leaders in Stepanakert also accused Azerbaijan's military of violating a fragile cease-fire deal that had been brokered by Russia in early April.
Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, for its part, accused Armenian forces on April 27 of violating the cease-fire deal 120 times during the previous 24 hours.
On April 26, separatist leaders said two ethnic Armenian soldiers had been killed by Azerbaijani forces.
Nagorno-Karabakh in early April saw its worst violence since a cease-fire in 1994 effectively froze the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenian-backed separatists in the breakaway region.
The latest cease-fire went into effect on April 5.
