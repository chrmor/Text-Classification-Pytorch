Suriname recognizes Palestinian state
RAMALLAH (Maâ€™an) -- The Republic of Suriname on Tuesday became the latest South American country to recognize a Palestinian state on 1967 borders, Palestinian Authority Foreign Affairs Minister Riad Al-Malki said.
Surinamese President Desi Bouterse sent a letter to his PA counterpart Mahmoud Abbas via the Palestinian ambassador in Brazil, Al-Malki said.
Bouterse expressed Suriname's support for Palestinian national rights and the establishment of a state on 1967 borders in the letter which was also sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the minister said.
The 1967 borders include East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, lands occupied by Israel in the Six Day War.
Al-Malki said the latest recognition was another achievement of Palestinian diplomacy, which has focused on international recognition since negotiations with Israel collapsed in September.
In recognizing Palestine, Suriname joins a wave of other regional countries that include Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Guyana and Uruguay.
