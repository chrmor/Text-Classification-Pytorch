Two Belgian policewomen on guard outside a police station in the city of Charleroi were wounded in a machete attack on Saturday by an assailant who shouted “Allahu Akbar”, police said.
The attacker was shot in the chest and the leg by a third officer, also a woman. He was taken to hospital where he later died, Belgian media reported. His name was not immediately known.
One of the policewomen suffered severe face wounds when the assailant slashed her several times. She was being treated in hospital last night but her injuries were not described as life-threatening.
Her colleague was less seriously injured.
