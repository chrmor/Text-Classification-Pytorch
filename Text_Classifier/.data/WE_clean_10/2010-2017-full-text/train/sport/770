Magnus Carlsen Wins the 2012 London Chess Classic
Magnus Carlsen has won the 2012 London Chess Classic after an exceptional tournament that will live long in the memory.
His +5 performance in earning a third Classic title was enough to break the 13-year old Elo rating record of Garry Kasparov.
In the last round Magnus Carlsen was unable to defeat the world champion Vishy Anand, but by then he knew he had done enough to win the tournament.  The destiny of the first prize was decided when Vladimir Kramnik was unable to gain the victory he needed with black against Mickey Adams.
The tournament will also be remembered for Vladimir Kramnik's superb play, and a strong performance by Mickey Adams to cheer the home crowd.
Despite his final round draw, Kramnik placed second with a +4 score, achieving his highest rating in over a decade (2809.7 Elo).
Hikaru Nakamura finished win a win against Luke McShane to share third place with Adams, while Judit Polgar and Lev Aronian drew their game and finish in the bottom half of the standings.
