Rodney Culleton was never legally elected to Senate, High Court rules
After a protracted legal battle that began almost as soon as he was elected, Rod Culleton's election has been ruled ineligible by the High Court.
The unanimous full bench decision of the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, puts an end to the former One Nation senator's battle to stay in the upper house, regardless of the outcome of any of his other court battles, which include challenging a Federal Court bankruptcy ruling.
Mr Culleton was not in court for the judgment.
Parliament will not know who takes his place until after a recount. The Electoral Commission will now consider the ballots as if Mr Culleton's name had not existed on the ticket.
