Cairo court bans former NDP members from running in elections
The Cairo Court for Urgent Matters banned on Tuesday members of Hosni Mubarak’s now defunct National Democratic Party from running in parliamentary, presidential as well as local unit elections.
The judges reasoned that the NDP had passed laws that violated the constitution and ignored court rulings. The court stated that the party was dissolved by a previous court ruling in 2011 following Mubarak's ouster and its return to political life will pose a threat to Egypt and anger Egyptians.
The 2012 constitution committee, voted in by the post-Mubarak parliament, had approved a constitutional article prohibiting citizens who were members of the NDP in the last 10 years of Mubarak’s rule from running in elections.
The constitutional committee formed following the ouster of the Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi decided against an article that excludes any group from running for an electoral position.
Committee member Magdi El-Agat, who was also the judge that ordered the dissolution of the NDP in 2011, argued that stripping citizens of their political rights must be instituted through judicial order rather than by the national charter.
Last month, the Alexandria Court for Urgent Matters issued a ruling banning of Muslim Brotherhood members from running in elections.
