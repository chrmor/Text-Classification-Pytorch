Morocco flooding kills 3
Rabat, Morocco - Two women and a teenaged boy have died in flooding that has plagued Morocco over the past two days, authorities said on Saturday.
A 50-year-old woman, her daughter-in-law and the 14-year-old boy were swept away by flash flooding on Friday in the western region of Safi.
The younger woman was rescued, but later died in hospital in the Atlantic coastal city of Safi, south-west of Rabat.
The North African kingdom has been inundated by unseasonal rains and hit by heavy winds since Thursday.
In Agadir, south of Safi, authorities said more than 50 millimetres (about two inches) of rain have fallen since then, a fifth of normal annual precipitation.
And the highway linking Safi with Essaouira, further south, was closed to traffic because of the storms. - Sapa-AFP
