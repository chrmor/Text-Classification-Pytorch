Wallis and Futuna elects new assembly
Voters in Wallis and Futuna have gone to the polls in a territorial election to choose a new 20-member assembly for a five-year term.
Nine members were re-elected, including the former assembly president Mikaele Kulimoetoke.
Six women were elected, two more than in 2012.
Thirty-one electoral lists contested the polls in which much of the voting was along family lines.
The main campaign issues had been the high cost of living and the departure of many young people.
The territory has the French republic's only three kingdoms, with the kings being part of the territorial administration.
