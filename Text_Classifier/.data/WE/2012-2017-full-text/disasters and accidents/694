37 dead in waves of storms across Midwest, South
Joe Sullivan, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the tornado that swept through that and other Southern Indiana communities was an EF-4 -- meaning it had sustained winds of between 166 and 200 mph, putting it in the top 2% of all tornadoes in terms of strength. It went for 52 miles and was roughly 150 yards wide, he added.
It was unclear how many people were missing in Henryville, as well as the towns of Chelsea, Paynesville and Marysville -- all hit by tornadoes -- because authorities are still trying to wrap their arms around the sheer amount of devastation, Adams said.
One apparent tornado made its way down Main Street in West Liberty, shredding buildings and overturning cars along the way. Mike Lacy, with Morgan County's emergency management agency, reported that several people were rescued -- including one man trapped under up to 10 feet of debris -- though four died as a result of the storm across the county.
In Tennessee, there were reports of possible tornado touchdowns in nine counties, according to Jeremy Heidt, the state's emergency management spokesman. The National Weather Service later confirmed a tornado hit at least in Jackson, Putnam and Overton counties. At least 29 people were injured across the state.
"Thank goodness there were actually no injuries or fatalities reported in the Paulding County area," he said. "That is amazing to me, looking at some of this damage."
"It's like a bomb went off and everything is splintered, bricks are down, and trees, and just a lot of debris," Ohio Gov. John Kasich said after touring damage in those and other nearby towns.
He said that the state plans to work with the federal government to provide relief, though at this point there are no plans to request a federal disaster declaration. After talking with people who planned to rebuild, Kasich vowed "we'll be back."
