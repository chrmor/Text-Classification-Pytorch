NSW gets first female speaker
The NSW lower house has elected its first female speaker, with South Coast Liberal MP Shelley Hancock given the job of keeping the notorious "bear pit" in order.
As expected, Ms Hancock was on Tuesday elected unopposed as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, during the first sitting of the NSW parliament since Barry O'Farrell's landslide election victory in March.
As per custom, she was dragged to the chair by the former speaker, the independent Richard Torbay, and new Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian.
Ms Hancock, who entered parliament in 2003, promised to be an impartial and independent umpire in the lower house, despite her political allegiances.
"My role is clear: to assist and guide you all and preside over the legislative assembly of the parliament with fairness and impartiality," Ms Hancock told the lower house.
Ms Hancock thanked lower house MPs for the "considerable honour" of being elected speaker.
