Scarsdale 'Pot Mom' admits it all in federal court.
The Scarsdale “Pot Mom” has pleaded guilty to running a multimillion dollar marijuana-growing operation like the lead character in the Showtime series “Weeds.”
Andrea Sanderlin slinked into Brooklyn Federal Court Monday for a hastily-arranged proceeding before Magistrate Robert Levy.
After wearily answering the judge's questions with a series of "Yes sirs" and "No sirs," Sanderlin, 45, admitted her drug crimes took place from 2009 right up to the time she was arrested in May.
"I operated a facility in which I, together with others, grew at least 1,000 marijuana plants and sold the marijuana product from the plants," Sanderlin said.
The bleached-blond mom was busted by federal agents who discovered a reefer plantation she was overseeing in a Maspeth, Queens, warehouse from her rented $10,000-a-month mansion in Westchester where she posed as an upscale divorced mom rode horses and drove a Mercedes Benz.
She told the judge she had not consumed any narcotics or alcohol in the past 24 hours and understood the charge she was pleading guilty to carried a 10-year minimum sentence and a maximum of life in prison.
"It's been made clear to me, your honor," Sanderlin said somberly.
There is an exception to mandatory minimum sentences called a “safety valve” that could be triggered depending on the defendant having a minor criminal history without violence and a willingness to voluntarily spill everything to prosecutors about the crime.
It is unclear whether Sanderlin will qualify for the safety valve or whether she's ratting out her co-conspirators.
Sanderlin's lawyer Corey Winograd, who denied there was any development in his client's case on Monday, did not return a call.
Sanderlin is free on $500,000 bail and living with her mother in Manhattan.
