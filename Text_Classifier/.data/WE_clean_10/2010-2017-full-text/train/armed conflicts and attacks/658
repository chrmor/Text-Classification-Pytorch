Turkish police arrest 11 more in connection with airport bombing
ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 2 (UPI) -- Turkish police arrested a total of 41 people in connection with a terrorist attack on Istanbul Ataturk Airport that killed 44 people, officials said.
An anti-terror raid of an Istanbul apartment Friday night netted 11 more suspects, ABC News reported. The news organization could not confirm whether each in a series of raids Friday were in connection with the airport bombing, where three men opened fire at a security checkpoint before blowing themselves up.
Turkish police told the pan-Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat all 11 arrested Friday are foreign nationals, but did not identify from where.
Two of the bombers have been identified as Rakim Bulgarov and Vadim Osmanov. The men were identified after photocopies of their passports were provided by their landlord, police said. The identity of the third suicide bomber has yet to be confirmed.
No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though U.S. intelligence officials said it was organized by a known Chechen-born Islamic State commander, Akhmed Chatayev. Turkish police have not confirmed Chatayev's involvement.
