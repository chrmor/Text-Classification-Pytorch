Tropical Rainstorm Vamco Unleashes Flooding in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia
Tropical Rainstorm Vamco will bring flooding rain to portions of Indochina through at least Wednesday.
As of Monday evening local time, 215 mm (8 inches) of rain from Vamco has been reported in Da Nang, Vietnam, before making landfall south of the city as a tropical storm. Wind gusts up to 70 km/h (45 mph) were reported in the city as well.
Although the tropical cyclone quickly weakened across the mountainous terrain of Vietnam and Laos Monday night local time, flooding will persisted in the region.
Rain continued to deluge Dong Hoi, Vietnam Monday and Tuesday. Rainfall totals reached 305 mm (12 inches) in just two days.
Heavy rain will press south and west into Thailand, Cambodia and southern Vietnam Tuesday and Wednesday; a general 75-150 mm (3-6 inches) of rain will threaten these areas, with more isolated areas receiving 300 mm (12 inches).
Due to the mountainous terrain of the region, rivers are expected to rapidly rise leading to life-threatening flash flooding. Water-logged hillsides may give way and lead to mudslides.

Drenching downpours and the threat for flooding could remain across Cambodia, Thailand and southern Myanmar during the second half of the week.
Despite containing locally damaging winds at the time of landfall, flooding rain is expected to be the primary concern and will threaten areas for several days.
Vamco originally took shape east of Vietnam early Sunday night, local time, and was classified as a tropical depression. The tropical cyclone quickly strengthened into a tropical storm before making landfall along the central coast of Vietnam.
