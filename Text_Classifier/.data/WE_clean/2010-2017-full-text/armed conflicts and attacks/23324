Reports: 4 Islamic State militants, 2 policemen killed in police raid in southeast Turkey
Turkish media reports say police have raided a house used by Islamic State group militants in southeastern Turkey, triggering a clash that killed four militants and two policemen.
The state-run Anadolu Agency says police launched the operation against a suspected IS cell in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Monday. Two policemen were killed by bombs detonated by the militants. Four other police officers were injured.
The private Dogan news agency says at least two of the dead militants were killed in a shootout.
It was not immediately clear if the operation was linked to suicide bombings of a peace rally in the capital Ankara earlier this month that killed 102 people. One of the bombers was identified as a IS militant.
