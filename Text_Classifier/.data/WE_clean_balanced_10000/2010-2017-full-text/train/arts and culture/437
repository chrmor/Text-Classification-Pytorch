Baltimore 'Quietly' Takes Down Four Confederate Statues After Charlottesville
For some communities, there remains the struggle of what to do next.
"City and town leaders must think hard about what they plan to do with the monuments if they remove them," said Aaron Astor, a history professor at Maryville College in Tennessee who focuses on the Civil War era. "As a historian, I generally favor preserving the old statues as artifacts of collective memory and placing them in a museum."
New Orleans, which removed four prominent Confederate monuments this spring and spurred a national debate, appears to remain in limbo over them.
The city has previously said that only nonprofits and government entities could apply to take the statues, which were shipped to city-owned warehouses or secured facilities.
Mayor Mitch Landrieu's office said Wednesday that officials are still soliciting queries.
In Gainesville, Florida, the long-debated removal of a statue dubbed "Old Joe," which is dedicated to fallen Confederate soldiers, only made headway after the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy agreed last month to take charge of it. The organization had it constructed in 1904 and it was installed in front of the Alachua County Administration Building.
The group did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but the statue was removed Monday and has since been placed in a cemetery southeast of Gainesville, according to The Gainesville Sun.
