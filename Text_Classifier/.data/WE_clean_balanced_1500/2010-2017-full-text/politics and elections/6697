San Bernardino votes to file for bankruptcy protection
The San Bernardino City Council votes to file for bankruptcy. Facing a $45-million budget shortfall and the prospect of not being able to pay city workers, the panel Tuesday voted to file municipal bankruptcy, the third California city to do so in recent weeks.
The vote came shortly after the interim city manager recommended seeking bankruptcy protection, saying the city may not be able to make payroll over the next three months. "We have an immediate cash flow issue," Andrea Miller told the mayor and seven-member council.
The dire fiscal situation remains even after the city negotiated $10 million in concessions from employees and slashed the workforce by 20% over the last four years.
If San Bernardino declares bankruptcy, it would be the third California city to do so in recent weeks, joining Stockton and Mammoth Lakes. The council called special back-to-back budget meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, which are expected to attract a packed house at City Hall.
