Singapore, Malaysia to build rail link
SINGAPORE and Malaysia announced that they will build a high-speed rail link between the city-state and Kuala Lumpur with a target to complete it around 2020.
"This is a strategic development in bilateral relations that will dramatically improve the connectivity between Malaysia and Singapore," said a statement issued after a meeting between Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak.
"It will usher in a new era of strong growth, prosperity and opportunities for both countries. It will facilitate seamless travel between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, enhance business linkages and bring the peoples of Malaysia and Singapore closer together."
The statement said the two leaders tasked a joint ministerial committee to look into the details and implementation of the project.
