PressTV-Yemen army seizes 4 Saudi bases
Yemeni forces have seized control of four Saudi military bases in the southwestern province of Dhahran al-Janub.
Fighters of the Houthi Ansarullah movement, backed by allied forces of the army, took control of the strategically important bases in the Saudi province, the southwestern region of Asir, Yemen's al-Masirah TV reported on Saturday.
The Yemeni forces set fire to lookout towers and three munitions depots at the Saudi bases. The Ansarullah fighters also destroyed at least 19 military vehicles of Saudi forces in the region.
Several Saudi soldiers are reported to have been killed in the latest operation by the Yemeni forces.
Separately, Ansarullah fighters inflicted heavy losses on Saudi forces after they targeted military installations in the regions of al-Hejlah and Jabal al-Doud in Jizan Province of southern Saudi Arabia.
The retaliatory attacks by Yemeni forces came after Saudi Arabia bombarded several areas in the impoverished Arab country.
Latest reports say Saudi Arabia bombed a residential area in the Majz district of Sa'ada Province. At least four children died.
On Friday, at least 10 people were killed in Saudi airstrikes on a village in Yemen’s southwestern province of Ta’izz. Similar airstrikes killed three civilians in the central province of Ma’rib.
More foreign forces are joining the Saudi military aggression against Yemen. The Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV recently reported that 10,000 foreign troops are currently operating in Yemen.
In a bid to undermine the Houthi movement and bring back to power Riyadh’s staunch ally fugitive former Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, Saudi Arabia started its military aggression against Yemen on March 26 without a UN mandate.
According to the UN, the conflict has so far left about 4,500 people dead and thousands of others wounded. Local Yemeni sources, however, say the fatality figure is much higher.
