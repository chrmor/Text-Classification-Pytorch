Thai-Cambodia clashes claim six lives
Cambodian and Thai troops clashed for a fourth straight day, Phnom Penh said, as UN chief Ban Ki-moon called for "maximum restraint" in a border dispute that has claimed at least six lives.
The latest flare-up erupted during an operation by Thai soldiers to recover casualties from Sunday's heavy fighting, according to Cambodia, which accused Thailand of damaging an 11th-century temple at the centre of the hostilities.
"The firing has started for the fourth time," Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday, adding that one Cambodian soldier was killed overnight.
Thailand, however, played down the reports of fresh fighting on Monday, with a military source near the border describing the incident as a "misunderstanding", involving only small arms fire.
He said 13 Thai soldiers were injured on Sunday night, one seriously.
The renewed clashes shattered a brief ceasefire agreed on Saturday after the worst fighting between the two neighbours in years.
