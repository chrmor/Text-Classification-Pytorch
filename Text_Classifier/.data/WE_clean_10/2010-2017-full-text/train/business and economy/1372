RBS could cut 14,000 staff in retreat from US and Asia
Ross McEwan wants to focus bailed-out bank on UK and reduce presence to 13 countries from current 38, shedding up to four in five investment-banking staff
As many as 14,000 staff in the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland face the axe in the coming years as the bailed-out bank retrenches from its expansion into the US and Asia.
The scale of the cutbacks – which would represent four in five jobs in investment banking – emerged after last week’s remarks by Ross McEwan, the boss of the 81%-taxpayer bank,that substantial numbers of jobs would be lost.
In the latest retrenchment of the investment bank, he wants to reduce RBS’s presence to 13 countries, compared with 38 at the end of last year, to focus on the UK. Many of the losses are expected at its offices in Stamford, Connecticut, where RBS has one of the largest trading floors in the world, and across Asia as it focuses its operations on Japan.
Last week, McEwan had said the changes mark “the end of a standalone investment bank at RBS”. The bank is expected to try to sell off some of its international operations rather than close down businesses altogether.
RBS would not comment on a report by the Financial Times about the extent of the job cuts planned.
