Fire guts popular West African market
KUMASI, Ghana, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Fire gutted a large and popular market in Kumasi, Ghana, known for attracting traders from throughout West Africa, authorities said.
No injuries were reported in Saturday's fire, which started in a part of the market run by animal-hide dealers and shoe sellers, Ghana News Agency reported.
The fire, which burned for several hours, was difficult to bring under control because of the market's haphazard layout and overcrowded stalls and aisles, authorities told the BBC Sunday.
The cause of the fire was under investigation, said Ashanti Regional Police Command spokesman Patrick Timballah.
It was the market's second fire in less than a year.
