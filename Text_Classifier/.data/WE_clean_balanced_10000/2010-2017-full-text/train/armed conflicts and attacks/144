S. Korea deploys precision-guided missiles targeting Pyongyang
SEOUL, June 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korea has deployed precision-guided land missiles capable of hitting North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, a military source said Friday. The forward deployment of the surface-to-surface missiles, known as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), came as tensions rekindled after North Korea vowed a retaliation against the South's military over its use of head-shot photos of Pyongyang's top leaders as targets for shooting practice.
