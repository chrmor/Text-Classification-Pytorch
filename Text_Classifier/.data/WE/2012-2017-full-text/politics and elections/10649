Afghanistan election 'back on track', says Ashraf Ghani
The winning presidential vote is still being disputed in Afghanistan but Ashraf Ghani could be the next leader after preliminary results of the second-round vote put him in front.
The two contenders, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, agreed to an audit in an attempt to resolve a dispute over the result after both candidates accuse the other of electoral fraud.
Mr Ghani told BBC News the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, had helped put their election back on track.
