S. Korea to submit claim on East China Sea shelf to U.N. this year
SEOUL, July 3 (Yonhap) -- South Korea has decided to submit a claim to an extended portion of the continental shelf in the East China Sea to a United Nations commission within this year, the government said Sunday, a move expected to rekindle its dispute with China and Japan over the extent of their respective exclusive economic zones. The submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) will claim that the country's statutory exclusive economic zone stretches beyond the current 200 nautical miles, government officials said.
