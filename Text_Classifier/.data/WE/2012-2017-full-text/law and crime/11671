Belgian serial rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken 'to be euthanised' in January
A Belgian serial rapist who asked to be euthanised because of his "unbearable" psychological suffering is to have his wish granted.
Frank Van Den Bleeken, who has spent 30 years behind bars after being convicted of a series of rapes and the rape and murder of a teenage girl, will be euthanised in a jail in Bruges on 11 January, local media reported.
The government has not released a statement on the matter, but a justice ministry spokeswoman was quoted by Flemish-language newspaper De Morgen as saying: "Euthanasia will indeed be implemented. Now the time has come."
Van Den Bleeken requested for years that the state help him end his life, after Belgium became the second country outside the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia 12 years ago.
He was granted his wish in September 2014, but no date was set for his death.
There was a record 1,807 cases of euthanasia in the country in 2013.
According to an interview he gave with Belgian media, Van Den Bleeken refused to be considered for early parole, as he believed himself to be a menace to society but considered the conditions of his detention unbearable.
