Evacuated NSW residents bunker down
Residents in flood-hit northern NSW are spending the night in evacuation centres after being ordered to leave homes following torrential rain caused by the remnants of ex-tropical Cyclone Debbie.
Up to 6000 residents in Lismore were ordered to evacuate with major flooding along the Wilsons River on Thursday night.
About 60 people were sleeping at the local Southern Cross University campus as streets, bridges and shops were hit by floodwaters.
The local airport was closed and all flights cancelled and the Simes bridge was under water and inaccessible by the evening.
Real estate agent Katrina Beohm spent the day sandbagging and mopping up rainwater from her shopfront in East Lismore.
But she was expecting more work in the morning.
"We've still got some water expected to peak which will come over the floodwater and if that happens, it's unknown what will happen," she told AAP.
"We're just preparing for another incident through the night."
The State Emergency Service conducted 37 flood rescues mainly in Lismore, where the level of the Wilsons River was predicted to top that recorded during 2001 and 2005 floods.
Closer to the Queensland border, residents in 500 homes in the South Murwillumbah, Condong and Tumbulgum areas have also been ordered to evacuate, with the Tweed River experiencing major flooding.
People in Tweed Heads South and West, Chinderah, Kingscliff, Fingal Head and Bilambil were told to leave too.
The Tweed River at Murwillumbah was expected to reach 5.60 metres.
At one Lismore property, 19 adults and nine children surrounded by floodwaters were rescued.
Spokesman Andrew Richards urged residents not to drive through floods.
"If it's flooded, forget it," he told AAP.
The Bureau of Meteorology said the far northeast of the northern rivers area had been deluged with 280mm rain by evening with another 100mm expected by Friday morning.
The dump across the eastern parts of the state is expected to head east once Debbie pulls away from about dawn on Friday, forecaster Mohammed Nabi told AAP.
Lismore residents can expect some respite for the clean-up as the rainfall starts to ease.
"It will be nothing like (Thursday)," Mr Nabi said.
However, Debbie's retreat will come with strong gale force winds and damaging surf conditions around Yamba, in northern NSW.
