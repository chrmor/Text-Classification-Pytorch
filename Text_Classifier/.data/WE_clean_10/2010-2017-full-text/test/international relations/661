Two Americans freed by North Korea arrive in U.S.
"I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me during this time," Bae said in brief comments to the media at the base.
"I'd like to thank the DPRK North Korean government, as well -- allowing me to come home and be united with our family," he said, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North Korean government issued a statement about the release, saying it received an "earnest apology" from Obama for the men's actions. It also said the two were "sincerely repentant of their crimes and (were) behaving themselves while serving their terms."
A U.S. official told CNN that Washington believes Pyongyang reached out to show it had the clout to get a Cabinet-level official to visit and because doing so would help solidify Kim's power. The request came about two weeks ago, the official said.
He canceled an event in New York on Wednesday as the trip was being arranged, an Obama administration official said. He went to Pyongyang "prepared to listen" on other issues, but his sole focus was to bring Bae and Miller home, according to the same official.
"We know that there are many people in North Korea locked up like Kenneth was, and they remain apart from their families tonight," she said as she stood beside her brother. "Please do not forget them."
There was no public comment from Miller's family Saturday, and he didn't speak to reporters after he got off the plane in Washington state. His family, from Bakersfield, California, had shied away from the media throughout his detention.
