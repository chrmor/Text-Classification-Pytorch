Ecowas asks UN to take measures to get Gbagbo to cede power
West African leaders ended a two day regional summit on Ivory Coast with a call to the United Nations to take immediate steps to force President Laurent Gbagbo out.
Meeting under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) they described Ivory Coast as a regional humanitarian emergency caused by Mr Gbagbo's refusal to hand over power to Alassane Ouattara; who is judged to have won elections held last November.
Our Correspondent John James gives his reaction to the request from Ecowas.
