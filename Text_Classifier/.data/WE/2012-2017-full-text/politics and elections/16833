Human rights groups criticize European Union-Turkish plan to stop Syrian migrants
This latest attempt at a solution has not yet been approved but could see the 28-nation EU officially take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every migrant returned to Turkey from Greece. It would also see billions of dollars more in refugee aid sent to Turkey, faster EU membership talks with Ankara and visa-free travel for its citizens within four months.
