EDGEWATER — Famed Yankees radio announcer John Sterling is one of the hundreds of victims in the massive five-alarm fire that destroyed a luxury apartment complex in Edgewater Wednesday night.
“Maybe I’ll get lucky and there won’t be that much damage,” he told the Daily News from a hotel room far from the Avalon apartments off River Road. "I have nowhere to go. And I need a toothbrush."
The broadcaster said he smelled intense smoke and tried to walk into the elevators in the rear of the building before being beaten back by the heavy smoke.
Despite the likely loss of his possessions, an upbeat Sterling told the paper that he's received phone calls from concerned friends, including radio partner Suzyn Waldman and Yankee great Willie Randolph.
The fire, which began at about 4 p.m., quickly engulfed the complex at 102 Russell Avenue. Fire officials evacuated the properties and continue to battle soaring flames, which can be seen from across the Hudson River in Harlem.
There have not been any reports of serious injuries. Fire officials do not yet know what started the fire.
It's the second massive fire at the apartment complex since 2000.
