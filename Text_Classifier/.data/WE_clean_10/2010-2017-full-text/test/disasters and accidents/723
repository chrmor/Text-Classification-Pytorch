Peru sends in army to deal with floods blamed on El Niño
The authorities in Peru are sending the military to help areas affected by floods that have afflicted several parts of the country.
Scientists blame El Niño, the warm ocean current, for the heavy rains that turned roads into rivers in Arequipa, setting cars adrift in the torrent. The southern province has been particularly badly hit; at least two people were reportedly killed.
Residents in Tumbes, a coastal region in the northwest, were also left to survey the damage.
Local media reported that 3,000 people in the area had been left homeless, with 30,000 affected in some way.
The Andean nation has struggled for over a week to cope with violent weather that has also caused landslides and power cuts.
Throughout the country hundreds of people have been forced from their homes.
The Ministry of Defence said on Monday that 250 soldiers would be sent to help clean up and rebuild damaged towns in the regions of Arequipa, Huanuco and Piura, among others.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has already said in February that this year’s El Niño is the strongest in over 15 years, although it has passed its peak strength.
More than a year ago flooding in Peru was reported to have caused severe problems in the country for several months.
