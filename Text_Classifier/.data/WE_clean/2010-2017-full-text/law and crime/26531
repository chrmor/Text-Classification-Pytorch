Mom found guilty of murdering son 25 years ago
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — A Florida woman was found guilty Wednesday of killing her 5-year-old son 25 years in New Jersey.
Michelle Lodzinksi, a former South Amboy, N.J., resident, had been accused of killing her son, Timothy Wiltsey, in 1991. Timothy had allegedly disappeared on May 25, 1991, from a Memorial Day weekend carnival in Sayreville, N.J.
Timothy's disappearance sparked a nationwide manhunt involving the FBI, state, county and local police, as well as hundreds of volunteers. His story was featured on television's America's Most Wanted, and milk cartons featured his picture.
Timothy's skeletal remains were found nearly a year later in April 1992 in a creek in Raritan Center in Edison, N.J., not far from a building where Lodzinski once worked.
The verdict comes a week before the 25th anniversary of Timothy's disappearance.
Lodzinksi, 48, was charged two years ago. She was living in Port St. Lucie, Fla., when she was arrested Aug. 6, 2014, on what would have been her son's 29th birthday after a Middlesex County, N.J., grand jury issued a one-count indictment charging her with Timothy's murder.
The one-page indictment didn't mention the cause of death or specify what evidence led authorities to charge Lodzinski. The grand jury said she "did purposely or knowingly kill" Timothy or did "purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily injury" resulting in his death.
After the verdict was read Wednesday, Lodzinski appeared to be crying and shaking her head. She was immediately led out of the courtroom and sent to the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center in North Brunswick, N.J., where she has been since her arrest in August 2014. She will be sentenced Aug. 23.
As she was led away, her brother, Michael Lodzinski, yelled, "I love you, sis." He said afterward that only she knows what happened to Timothy.
Her attorney, Gerald Krovatin, said he was extremely disappointed with the verdict and that an appeal is likely.
Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew Carey had no comment on the verdict, nor did any of the jurors.
