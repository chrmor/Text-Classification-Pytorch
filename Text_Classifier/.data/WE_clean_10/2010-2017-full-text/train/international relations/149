Newly released British government papers from 1980 show British diplomats believed Israel was prepared to use a nuclear weapon against its Arab neighbours.
The previously secret cable from the British embassy said Israel was ready to use a nuclear weapon in the event of a war breaking out.
Israel had signed a peace treaty with Egypt a year before, but the cable warned the Jewish state's mood of isolation and defiance was growing.
Israel has never confirmed nor denied it has produced nuclear weapons.
