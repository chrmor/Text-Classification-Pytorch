PressTV-US drone attack kills two in Yemen
A US drone has struck a vehicle in southern Yemen, leaving two people dead and another injured, security sources say.
The drone targeted the car in Yemen's southeastern province of Shabwa on Sunday night. According to residents, the car was totally destroyed and no one escaped from the attack.
A military source said missiles, fired from the US drone, struck the four-wheel drive car in the tribal area of Haban.
It was the second such deadly attack this week. On Saturday, another American drone struck a vehicle in Marib province, east of the capital Sana’a and killed two people.
The US carries out drone attacks in Yemen and several other Muslim countries, including Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Washington claims its drones target al-Qaeda militants, but local sources say civilians have been the main victims of the attacks.
The drone attacks in Yemen have continued alongside the Saudi military aggression against the Arab country.
Saudi Arabia has been bombing the country for more than a year now. The kingdom launched the aggression in Yemen to reinstate former President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who is a staunch ally of Riyadh.
More than 9,400 people have been killed and at least 16,000 others injured in the Saudi aggression.
Many of the Western countries, including the US and Britain, stand accused of aiding Saudi Arabia in its invasion of Yemen.
