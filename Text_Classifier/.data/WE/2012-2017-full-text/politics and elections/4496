The coast guard confirmed to the BBCthat while on duty for the Royal Air Force, Wills was called upon to pilot the RAF Sea King helicopter that was sent out to search for a 41-year-old Blackpool man who, while walking his dog along the coastline during gale-force winds, was swept to sea in the early morning hours of Jan. 1.
