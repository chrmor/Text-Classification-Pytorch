US blues singer Etta James treated for leukaemia
US blues legend Etta James has been diagnosed with dementia and is undergoing treatment for leukaemia.
The 72-year-old's health problems came to light in court documents filed by her husband, Artis Mills, who is seeking control of her finances.
Mr Mills claims the singer, known for her hit ballad At Last, has become too sick to manage her own money.
A doctor has also stated the star needs help with eating, dressing and cannot sign her own name.
Mr Mills is seeking a court order for control of more than $1 million (Â£630,000).
He is also challenging the power of attorney James gave to sons Donto James and Sametto James, and Donto's wife Christy, in February 2008.
Donto wrote in his court declaration he does not object to money being released for his mother's medical care.
But he requests it to be overseen by a third party "to avoid present and future family conflict and discrepancies".
James has been out of the public eye since January last year when she was admitted to hospital after suffering from various ailments, including a blood infection.
She became ill while in a detox clinic for treatment to an addiction to painkillers and other medicines.
James is the winner of four Grammy awards and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
In the 2008 film Cadillac Records she was portrayed on screen by the singer Beyonce Knowles.
