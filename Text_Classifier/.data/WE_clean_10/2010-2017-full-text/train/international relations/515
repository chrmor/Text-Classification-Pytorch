PNG  reacts with fury to Bob Carr's sanction threat
PAPUA New Guinea has responded with dismay over Bob Carr's surprise threat to sanction the country, calling in Australia's top diplomat in Port Moresby for a dressing down.
After only two days in the job, Australia's new Foreign Minister has already sparked a diplomatic incident after raising the prospect to ''condemn and isolate'' PNG should elections be delayed.
PNG took the rare and serious step to call in Australia's Acting High Commissioner in Port Moresby, Margaret Adamson this afternoon to complain about Senator Carr's comments made last night during a television interview.
Charles Lepani, PNG's envoy to Australia, told National Times the tone of Senator Carr's comments — the first interaction Senator Carr had had with PNG — caught him by surprise.
''When you talk about santions, it is a serious international weapon,'' he said.
