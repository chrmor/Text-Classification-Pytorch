India-China troops face-off near Line of Actual Control in Ladakh
LEH/NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops recently had a face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh , the same area where People's Liberation Army had pitched camps in April, 2013 that had led to a three-week long stalemate. According to officials in the know of developments, the Chinese troops had built a temporary hut in Burtse, North of Ladakh, which was subsequently demolished by the ITBP and Army jawans yesterday. China is said to be eyeing this area, which gives advantage to India to overlook the Karakoram highway linking the territory illegally occupied by China with Pakistan- occupied-Kashmir. Besides, India has an Advanced Ground Landing (AGL) facility in Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) which was activated in August 2013 and the Indian Air Force had managed to land a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft at the air strip located at 16614 feet above sea level. After reports about the construction of a hutment reached ITBP personnel , a joint patrol of para-military forces and the Army was sent to the area after which it was demolished. Attempts for a flag meeting did not succeed as Chinese side did not revert on the date for a meet, the sources said. The PLA troops had made attempts to push the Indian troops back but these were thwarted, they said. Indian troops displayed the banners in Chinese asking the PLA to return to their side, the officials said. India and China share over 4,000 km of LAC. China claims approximately 90,000 sq km of territory in Arunachal Pradesh besides 38,000 sq km in Jammu and Kashmir sector. Defence Ministry officials in Delhi declined to comment.
