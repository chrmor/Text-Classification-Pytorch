Thousands involved in Chinese factory fight
Foxconn Technology Group has closed a factory at Taiyuan in Chinaâ€™s Shanxi province after a personal dispute spiraled into a brawl involving 2000 workers in a dormitory, injuring 40.
The Taiyuan plant, which employs about 79,000 workers, makes automobile electronic components, consumer electronic components and precision moldings. An employee told Reuters the plant also makes parts and assembles Apple's iPhone 5.
In a statement, Foxconn cited police as saying about 40 people were taken to hospital for medical attention and a number were arrested.
The company said the incident escalated from what it called a personal dispute between several employees at around 11pm on Sunday in a privately managed dormitory, and was brought under control by local police at around 3am.
