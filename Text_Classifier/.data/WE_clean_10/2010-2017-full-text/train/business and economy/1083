In Boon to Its Stock, Apple Will Replace AT&T in Dow Index
Apple, the highest-valued company in the world, will be added to the Dow Jones industrial average next month in yet another sign of how popular the computer giant has become for investors.
Apple, a top investment holding for risky hedge funds as well as retirees, will replace the telecommunications company AT&T, a technology standard-bearer in its day, on March 19, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in an announcement on Friday.
The step, which had been widely expected, is a reminder of the soaring valuations among consumer-driven technology and social media companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter.
But no company approaches Apple in terms of raw value. Its market capitalization of $744 billion is about equal to the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia, and analysts have predicted that the company could soon become the worldâ€™s first trillion-dollar company.
