Russian Official Speaks Out Against 'The Interview' Release
The Interview has been making news in Russia. 
A senior Russian cultural official spoke out against the release of The Interviewin Russia, while North Korea's embassy in Moscow issued a statement calling on Russians not to watch the film. Meanwhile, Russian news agencyRIA Novosti quoted a spokesman for the Russian office of Sony Pictures as saying that a decision about a release of the film in Russia would be made in the new year.
The movie is already available on Russian torrents.
"We need to keep in mind that we have certain historic relations with [North Korea]," Mikhail Shvydkoy, President Vladimir Putin's special envoy for international cultural cooperation, was quoted as saying by news agency Interfax. "And what is most important — we don't have a tradition of insulting another country's president."
North Korea's embassy in Moscow also issued a statement. "The film The Interview, produced by the U.S. studio Sony Pictures, is a very dangerous film product that justifies and promotes terrorism. This film is also filled with anti-propaganda of low and evil tools for assaulting the head of a merited sovereign state," said the statement quoted by Interfax. 
However, within a few hours of the online premiere of the movie in the U.S., it became available on several Russian torrents, including katushka.net, torentor.net, torentkino.ru and tracktor.tv.
Meanwhile, legitimate Russian online video services said they would be interested in providing the movie to their audiences but have not received any offer from Sony Pictures, online newspaper Lenta.ru reported.
To be officially released in Russia, the film would need an exhibition license from the culture ministry, but no application for such a license has been filed so far.
