Earthquake Hits Myanmar
CHIANG RAI, Thailand — A severe magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck a sparsely populated mountain area in the Golden Triangle region of northeastern Myanmar on Thursday, with tremors being felt over a wide radius.
News agencies reported Friday that as many as 50 people had been killed, a bridge was destroyed near the epicenter, homes were damaged in southern China and buildings shook as far away as Bangkok; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city.
Buildings were damaged near the epicenter in Myanmar’s Shan State and villagers felt aftershocks for several hours, said an official with World Vision, a children’s aid agency, in Myanmar. Reports of any damage and injuries, though, were slow to emerge overnight from the remote mountains and valleys.
The area affected is landlocked, and no tsunami warning was issued.
One woman was killed in this Thai border city, about 70 miles south of the epicenter, when a wall fell on her as she was sleeping, Thai television reported. Some people here said they were shaken from their beds or ran into the streets. One woman attending a funeral said she clung to a pole to stay upright.
“I felt I was swaying like a child in a cradle,” the woman, Nutpisut Thongkika, a 50-year-old teacher, said in a telephone interview from Chiang Rai. “The situation here was very chaotic when the earthquake hit.”
