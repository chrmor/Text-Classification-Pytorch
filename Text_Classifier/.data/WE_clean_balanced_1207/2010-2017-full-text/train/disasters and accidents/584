UN Appeals For $357 Million To Help Pakistan Flood Victims
The United Nations has launched an appeal for $357 million in donations from the global community to help millions of Pakistanis affected by floods that have damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and destroyed millions of acres of crops. Humaira Mehboob, a UN humanitarian aid spokeswoman, said the money would be used to help more than 5.4 million people in the flood-hit provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan over the next six months. The UN says that nearly every district in Sindh Province has seen flooding, as have five districts of neighboring Baluchistan, and that 342 people have been killed and more than 600 injured. The UN says that in Sindh Province the floods have damaged or destroyed around 665,000 homes and displaced more than 1.8 million people. It is the second consecutive year that Pakistan has been devastated by floods, with last year's floods affecting more than 20 million people.compiled from agency reports
