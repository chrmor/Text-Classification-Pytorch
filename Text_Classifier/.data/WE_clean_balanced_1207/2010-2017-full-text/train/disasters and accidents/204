Hottest night on record, but relief only hours away
The southerly buster bringing a cool change to Sydney has finally arrived, dropping temperatures by 10 degrees in an hour to end a record week-long heatwave.
Since about 2pm, the temperature in the city has fallen to about 26 degrees - lower than the overnight minimum of 27.6 degrees which was the hottest night ever recorded in Sydney.
It is expected to get even cooler as the afternoon progresses, with rain forecast for about 4pm and a possible storm. It will be the first rain for 15 days, the longest summer dry spell in five years.
Sydney recorded a maximum today of 35.6 degrees at 12.50pm before the cool change swept through the city.
The overnight low of 27.6 degrees was one degree higher than the previous record of 26.6, which occurred in February 1973.
It was still 33.2 degrees at midnight - seven degrees above the average daytime maximum temperature.
