Rep. David Wu makes his resignation official for 11:59 p.m. Wednesday
WASHINGTON -- Rep. David Wu resigned from office today, releasing a statement that ends his job as a member of Congress
The letter allows Gov. John Kitzhaber to start the timeline for a special election to replace Wu, a seven-term Democrat who had represented the 1st Congressional District.
Wu, 56, said a week ago he would quit following allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct with the teenage daughter of a longtime friend. But Wu also said he wouldn’t leave until resolution of the debt crisis. President Obama signed the compromise legislation at 11 a.m. Portland time on Tuesday.
Wu has declined interview requests since The Oregonian reported July 22 that in May, a woman had left a distraught-sounding voicemail at Wu’s Portland office. She has been identified as the daughter -- 18 years old at the time of the unwanted encounter last Thanksgiving -- of a childhood friend of Wu. When told, he told staff the encounter was consensual.
The congressman had initially wanted to stay through his term, and not seek re-election, but a formal call for an ethics investigation by his own caucus leader, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, made that difficult.
That day he announced he would resign, but not until he had seen the debt crisis through. On Monday, Wu voted in favor of the compromise legislation. The bill passed by a wide margin.
