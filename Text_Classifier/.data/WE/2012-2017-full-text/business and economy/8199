Ford Discloses Two New Recalls for the 2013 Escape
Ford is recalling about 140,000 of its 2013 Escape crossovers in the United States because of a problem with the 1.6-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine that has caused 13 fires, the automaker has told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to a reportfrom the automaker posted Tuesday on the safety agency’s website.
About 21,000 additional vehicles are being recalled in Canada and other export markets, a Ford spokeswoman, Kelli Felker, said in an interview.
Ford told the safety agency that “localized overheating of the engine cylinder head” could cause cracks, allowing oil to leak and ignite should it drip onto a hot surface. The automaker said that 12 fires had occurred in the United States and one in Canada, but that it was not aware of any injuries.
The automaker said dealers would fix the problem by making “enhancements to the engine shielding, cooling and control systems.”
In a second action, Ford is recalling about 9,500 of its 2013 Escapes in the United States, also with the 1.6-liter, 4-cylinder engine, because a previous repair for fuel leaks may not have been done correctly, according to a report posted Tuesday on the agency’s website.
