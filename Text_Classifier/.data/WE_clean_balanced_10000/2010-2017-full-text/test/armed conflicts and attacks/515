Death toll in Burundi barracks attacks rises to 87
BUJUMBURA, Burundi, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The United States on Sunday advised its citizens to leave Burundi as soon as possible following attacks on military barracks that killed 87.
According to a statement, the U.S. State Department "ordered the departure of dependents of U.S. government personnel and non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Burundi on Dec. 13."
It also warned U.S. citizens against traveling to the east African nation and advised "that U.S. citizens currently in Burundi depart as soon as it is feasible to do so."
The warning comes the same day the Burundian army reported the final death toll in last week's attacks against military installations in the capital and other locations. At least 79 gunmen, four soldiers and four police officers were killed Friday in assaults on multiple military barracks by at least 150 armed assailants.
Violence has escalated in Burundi since April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza ran for a third term in office -- a move opponents say is illegal under the country's constitution.
The United Nations estimates nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 200,000 forced to flee since then.
