Chad government says it foils coup attempt
N'DJAMENA, May 2 (Reuters) - Security forces in Chad foiled a coup against the government of President Idriss Deby that had been in preparation for several months, the West African desert nation's communications minister announced late on Wednesday.
"Today, May 1, a group of individuals with bad intentions sought to carry out an action to destabilise the institutions of the republic," Hassan Sylla Bakary read in a statement broadcast on state-owned television.
