Myanmar president Thein Sein says his government and the military, which gave up power only five years ago, will respect the results of Sunday's historic elections that are expected to be won by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party. (AP)Official results show Poland's conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by eurosceptic Jarosław Kaczyński and the new PM Beata Szydło, won more seats than any other party in today's general elections. Kaczyński is the twin brother of the late President Lech Kaczyński, who died in a 2010 jet crash. Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz has conceded defeat. (NDTV) (Newstalk) (AP via US News and World Report)
