Gas explosion at restaurant in central India triggers nearby explosives, killing at least 85: police
At least 85 people have been killed in central India after a cooking gas cylinder blew up in a restaurant and set fire to explosives stored nearby, police say.
The death toll rose rapidly from an initial count of 20 after rescuers recovered dozens more bodies from the debris of the destroyed restaurant and neighbouring buildings.
"Earlier we thought it was 104 based on various reports coming to us but now our own official information says 85 confirmed deaths," police inspector ML Gond said.
Arun Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer of Jhabua district, said about 100 people were injured in the blast, 20 of them seriously.
The gas cylinder exploded as people were gathering for breakfast at the restaurant in the town of Petlawad in the state of Madhya Pradesh, about 800 kilometres south of New Delhi, Inspector BL Gaur told Reuters.
Inspector Gaur said the restaurant was near an area which stored gelignite sticks used at construction sites.
"There was a second explosion, there were more casualties," Inspector Gaur said, adding the blast was so powerful it damaged adjacent buildings and ripped out nearby windows.
Television footage showed scores of people and rescue workers using their bare hands to shift mangled heaps of steel and concrete of the ruined buildings while police cordoned off the area.
Bodies covered in dust and ash lay in the streets alongside the twisted wreckage of burned vehicles.
Police said the blast knocked down a neighbouring building and damaged several others.
The restaurant was also nearby a busy bus stand.
Madhya Pradesh's chief minister has announced compensation for the victims' families.
"This is a tragic incident, which has shook me. The causes of the incident will be investigated," chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan told local television channels.
"Extremely pained at the loss of lives due to the cylinder blast in Jhabua," Mr Modi said.
Domestic gas cylinder explosions are common in India, where safety standards are relatively poor.
But although reports of fatal accidents from cylinder blasts are frequent, mass casualties are unusual.
