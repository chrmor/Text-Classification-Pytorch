A U.S. ban on sales of American components to ZTE Corp has unleashed a patriotic backlash in China's cyberspace, highlighting the growing tension between the world's two largest economies. The United States this week imposed a ban on American companies selling parts and software to ZTE for seven years, saying it had broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements - a move that threatens to cut off the Chinese firm's supply chain. Sympathy for ZTE has swept Chinese social media while most domestic newspapers have chosen to put the lion's share of the blame for the telecom equipment maker's troubles on China's heavy reliance on foreign semiconductors.
