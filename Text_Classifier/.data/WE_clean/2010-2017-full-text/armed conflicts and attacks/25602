Suicide blast kills 29 at Iraq football stadium; ISIS claims responsibility
In the latest terror attack linked to the Islamic State, at least 29 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a football stadium south of Baghdad Friday,Â Iraqi security officials told The Associated Press.
Nearly 60 other people were reported hurt.
Fox News has learned ISIS immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The terror group also said it was behind the bombings in Belgium Tuesday, which killed 31 people and wounded 270 others.
Security officials tell the AP Friday's bombing took place during a match in the small stadium in the city of Iskanderiyah, 30 miles from Baghdad. Medical officials confirmed the death toll.
The bombing came as Iraqi military spokesman Yahya Rusoul announced that Iraqi troops and Sunni tribal fighters recaptured the western town of Kubeisa from ISIS. The assault was part of operations aimed at rolling back the militants in Iraq's Sunni-majority Anbar province after government forces retook the provincial capital of Ramadi in February.
