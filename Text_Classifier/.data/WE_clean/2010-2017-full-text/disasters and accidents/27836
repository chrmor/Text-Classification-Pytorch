Storm may head toward Hawaii, coinciding with Obama visit
HONOLULU (AP) â€” Forecasters are watching a tropical storm as it cuts an uncertain path toward Hawaii, potentially coinciding with a visit by President Barack Obama.
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports (http://bit.ly/2brv6R0) Tropical Storm Madeline could bring moisture, wind and rain starting Tuesday.
A five-day forecast puts the storm near the Big Island on Wednesday before it passes south of Oahu on Thursday. The margin of error stretches 170 miles.
The storm was 985 miles from Hilo on Saturday night. Sustained winds reached up to 60 mph.
The Central Pacific Hurricane Center predicts the storm will strengthen into a hurricane before downgrading to a tropical storm near Hawaii.
Storm conditions may coincide with Obama's visit to Oahu on Wednesday and the World Conservation Congress on Thursday.
Forecasters say Tropical Cyclone Lester could impact the islands during Labor Day weekend.
