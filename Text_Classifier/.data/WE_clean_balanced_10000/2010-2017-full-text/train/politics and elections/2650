Syrian Chief Opposition Negotiator Resigns
The chief negotiator of Syria's main opposition umbrella group, Mohammed Allush, has resigned over what he called the failure of UN-backed peace talks.
Allush, from the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said the talks had not brought a political settlement or eased the plight of Syrians in besieged areas.
The HNC suspended its involvement in the UN-brokered "proximity" negotiations with a Syrian government delegation in Geneva in April. No date has been set for a resumption.
"The three rounds of talks were unsuccessful because of the stubbornness of the regime and its continued bombardments and aggressions against the Syrian people," Allush said on May 29.
Allush also said that without any of the opposition demands met, peace talks were a "waste of time,‚Äù adding that he did not expect peace talks to resume so long as the Syrian government remained intransigent and not ready to enter "serious negotiations."
