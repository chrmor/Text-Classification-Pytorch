The Thai government is lifting emergency rule in another three provinces, several months after security forces crushed long-running anti-government protests.
The emergency laws ban public gatherings of more than five people and allow the authorities to detain suspects for 30 days without charge.
The government has been lifting the special provisions in provinces where, in its view, the security situation has stabilised.
That includes three provinces in the north and north-east where the anti-government protest movements has its roots.
The state of emergency will remain in place in six other provinces as well as the capital Bangkok.
Some western governments and several human rights groups have expressed concern about the continued use of the law.
The government said only that today's decision was taken to help business and tourism.
