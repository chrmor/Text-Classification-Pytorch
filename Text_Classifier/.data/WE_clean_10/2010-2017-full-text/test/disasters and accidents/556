Queensland hit by flash flooding
Torrential rain has caused widespread flooding in the Australian state of Queensland.
Floodwaters have cut off several towns along the state’s coast and more than 70 roads including the state's major highways are impassable.
There have also been several dramatic rescues.
In one incident, a rescuer was swept away after dragging a 14-year-old boy to safety from raging floodwaters in the Queensland city of Rockhampton.
He was swept under a nearby bridge but then able to reach safety, Australia’s ABC news reported.
Local councillor Bill Ludwig said many of the central Queensland city's streets are flooded and “very destructive winds” are being felt from the low pressure system that once was cyclone Oswald.
The system is currently sitting about 120km west of Mackay in eastern Queensland and is expected to cause flooding in communities further south in coming days.
A record-breaking heatwave and high winds across southeastern Australia earlier this month produced some of the worst fire conditions ever seen in the country, with blazes destroying thousands of hectares of land and threatening properties, but – so far – sparing lives.
