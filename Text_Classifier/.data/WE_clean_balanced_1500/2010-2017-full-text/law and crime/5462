Detainees start self harm in Qld protest
A male refugee has cut his own throat and another his arm during a protest at a remote Queensland immigration detention centre.
The two protesters are among some 60 to 80 men who have been on a hunger strike since Thursday at the Scherger Immigration Detention Centre near Weipa, on the Cape York Peninsula.
Asylum Seeker Resource Centre spokesman Pamela Curr said on Saturday some of the detainees had been at Scherger for up to 20 months and were protesting out of frustration over the slow processing of their asylum claims.
"There are 80 men now who have been sitting outside medical for over 48 hours now," Ms Curr told AAP.
"Two men are unconscious and two men have cut themselves, one on his arm and one on his throat.
"One man has climbed a tree and was going to jump and his friends managed to bring him down."
