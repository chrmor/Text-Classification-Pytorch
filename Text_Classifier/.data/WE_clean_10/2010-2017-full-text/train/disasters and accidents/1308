Deadly floods swamp US northeast
Heavy rain has swamped areas of the US northeast already sodden from Hurricane Irene, with up to five people killed as flash floods forced more than 100,000 to flee their homes.
The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a flash flood warning for counties in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland and Virginia, as towns became inundated, busy highways closed down and commuter lines backed up.
US President Barack Obama declared an emergency in New York and Pennsylvania, ordering federal agencies to co-ordinate disaster relief efforts to "save lives and to protect property and public health and safety", the White House said late Thursday.
Some 100,000 people in Pennsylvania's Luzerne county are under "mandatory evacuation" orders, including 20,000 in the city of Wilkes-Barre, according to local officials.
Stephen Bekenich, the county's emergency management director, warned that those who remained in flood-prone areas could not count on being rescued.
"If folks choose not to leave, they are taking (their) lives into their own hands," he said. "Help may not be able to reach them."
