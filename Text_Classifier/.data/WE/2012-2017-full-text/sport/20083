Mary Keitany, Ghirmay Ghebreslassie win NYC Marathon
NEW YORK (AP) — Mary Keitany and Ghirmay Ghebreslassie came in first place in the women’s and men’s heats, respectively, of the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon.
Keitany, 34, is from Kenya and this win is her third consecutive TCS New York City Marathon title.
Her time was 2:24:26 according to the NYC Marathon Twitter account.
Ghebreslassie, 20, from Eritrea, is a decorated runner with several wins under his belt. This is his first time winning the NYC Marathon.
He became the youngest ever world marathon winner at age 19 when he won gold at the IAAF World Championships.
Ghebreslassie’s time was 2:07:51 according to the NYC Marathon Twitter account.
The five-borough marathon, the world’s largest, is marking its milestone 40th anniversary with Sunday’s race.
About 50,000 runners from more than 120 countries started the 26.2-mile race Sunday morning on Staten Island and crossed the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
It all began in 1970 when 126 men and one woman circled Central Park. Six years later, 2,000 amateurs took to the streets of New York, touching all five boroughs for the first time.
The winner was Bill Rodgers, then and three more times.
