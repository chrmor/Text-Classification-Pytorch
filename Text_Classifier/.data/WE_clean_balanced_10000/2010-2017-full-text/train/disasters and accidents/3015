Former MP Alex McTaggart among nine missing surfers found
FORMER NSW MP and Mayor of Pittwater Alex McTaggart are among a group of Sydney surfers who have been found after losing radio contact after a tsunami off the coast of Sumatra.
No contact has been made with the nine missing men, who were all on board the surfing boat the Southern Cross.
Mr McTaggart's wife, Denise, said she had previously tried to make contact but had not been successful.
“We haven’t heard yet and while it’s not looking good, I’m confident Alex and the others will come through it,” Mrs McTaggart told The Manly Dailyearlier today. “I contacted the company that runs the boat they were on, the Southern Cross, but they haven’t had any contact with the boat for a few days.” The other men believed to be on board the Southern Crossinclude Gary Mountford, Chris Papallo, Jeff Annesley, Chris Scurrah, Colin Steele, Steve Reynolds, Neil Cox and several crewmen.
Nigel Annesley, whose father Jeff is among the group, said he was confident the group would be alright. “I just did five weeks over there, these things are part and parcel of that whole place, it’s so volatile" he said. Mrs McTaggart said she believed the men would have survived whatever the tsunami throws at them.Meanwhile, another Australian surf charter boat skipper has described how the tsunami hurtled towards him, lifted his boat 4m into the air and tossed it into a nearby boat, which burst into flames.
Ten villages on a remote island chain in Indonesia were reportedly swept away by the tsunami overnight.
The death toll from the 7.7-magnitude quake had already hit 23 by 8pm (AEST). A further 167 people are missing and the toll is expected to climb.
