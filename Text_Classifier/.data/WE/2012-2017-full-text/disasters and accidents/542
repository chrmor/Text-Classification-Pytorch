Modi orders inquiry after six dead in temple stampede
Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has ordered an inquiry into the stampede at the Bhavnath temple in Junagadh district, where six devotees including three women were killed. At least 30 others were injured in the incident that took place during the annual Mahashivratri fair held at the foothills of Mount Girnar. Till about midnight, the injured were still being shifted to Junagadh Civil Hospital.According to police, the stampede broke out following panic after the brakes of a four-wheeler at the fair venue apparently failed. Tens of thousands of devotees had gathered there at the time for the popular fair which will conclude on the occasion of Mahashivratri tomorrow.Ambulance personnel said they were finding it difficult to take the injured to hospitals because of traffic jams at the road leading to the temple. The situation has now been brought under control, according to officials. An ex-gratia of one lakh each has been announced by the Gujarat government for the next of kin of the dead. A high-level inquiry has also been ordered into the incident.(With PTI inputs)
