Exiled govt ministers return to Yemen's Aden - officials
ADEN, July 16 (Reuters) - Several ministers and top intelligence officials touched down by helicopter in Yemen's war-torn southern city of Aden, Yemeni officials said, in the first visit by the exiled government based in Saudi Arabia in more than three months of war.
"(Exiled President) Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delegated this group to return to Aden to work to prepare the security situation and ensure stability ahead of a revival of the institutions of state in Aden," one of the officials told Reuters.
