Indonesia earthquake kills one, injures seven
A 5.9-magnitude earthquake has struck off Indonesia's Aceh province, killing an eight-year-old girl and injuring seven others, officials said.
The US Geological Survey says the quake struck 112 kilometres south-east of the provincial capital of Banda Aceh on Tuesday, at a depth of 37 kilometres.
The district's disaster management agency chief Apriyadi says an eight-year-old girl in Pidie district was killed after a cupboard in her bedroom fell on her when the quake shook the ground.
He says seven people have been injured, four of them seriously, due to collapsing walls.
No tsunami alert was issued by the Indonesian Meteorology, Geophysics and Climatology Agency (BMKG).
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity.
