Malaysian Sailors Abducted Near Philippines in Latest Act of Piracy
MANILA â€” Four sailors from Malaysia were kidnapped off a cargo ship passing close to the southern Philippines on Friday night, less than a week after 10 sailors from Indonesia were abducted nearby, according to police officials from the three countries.
The seizure of the men on Friday was the latest in a series of kidnappings in the lawless waters and coastlines of the southern Philippines in the past year.
More than 18 foreign citizens are being held in the southern Philippines by kidnap-for-ransom groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, the Philippine military said.
On Friday, eight armed men in a speedboat stopped a Malaysian cargo ship, the Masfive 6, about 6:15 p.m. near Ligitan, a small island off the eastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah, the state police commissioner, Datuk Abdul Rashid Harun, told the Malaysian government-run news agency, Bernama.
