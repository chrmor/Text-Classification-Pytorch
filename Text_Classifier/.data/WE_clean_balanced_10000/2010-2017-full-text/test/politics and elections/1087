The Supreme Court -- dominated by judges appointed by and loyal to the Chavista government -- said it had received requests for six protective mechanisms to suspend the elections results of six legislative districts in three states of the country.Days before, the outgoing National Assembly had just fortified the government dominance of the TSJ by appointing 13 new Supreme Court justices who were immediately sworn in and urged to follow the course of "radical socialism" by the Chief Justice.The Supreme Court has never ruled against the government since 2003, after which then-President Hugo Chavez increased the court size and packed the court with more loyalist judges.MUD Executive Secretary Jesus Torrealba called the move "continuation of the December 22 judicial coup," when the coalition alleged the ruling party had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the proclamation of 22 elected opposition representatives.The executive secretary urged supporters to accompany their elected candidates to the National Assembly on January 5, in response to a decision by Chavista supporters to turn up in a show of support, setting the stage for a possible ugly confrontation.
