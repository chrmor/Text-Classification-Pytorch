28,000 acres burned in Ventura County
Sue Martin and Coleman Trainor thought the danger has passed Shelburne Farm on Portrero Road, but then they noticed the winds change. When the neighboring ranch began evacuating animals about 2 p.m., they decided they should start to make plans for the 20 horses stabled on their own property. They worried how they would transport so many animals -- but then the trailers starting rolling in. Complete strangers showed up at the ranch, offering their help. "This is our third load," said Lisa Riley, who helped take the horses to a Moorpark equestrian center. "We do this for them because they need the help, and I'm sure they'd do it for us." Trainor, who is from Virginia, had never seen a wildfire before. "It's been really exciting to see the collaboration and assistance from people we don't even know," he said. "All of that has helped contribute to a successful evacuation. And now we've gotta go."
