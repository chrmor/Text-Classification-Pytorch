US files new charges against WikiLeaks soldier
The US military has brought 22 new charges against the junior soldier accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive US government documents that were published by WikiLeaks.
Bradley Manning, a former intelligence analyst suspected of disclosing the documents, is being held at a Marine base in Virginia as US officials investigate last year's publication of state department cables and military documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The new charges include the capital offence of "aiding the enemy" but prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty in the case.
Instead, the 23-year-old soldier could possibly face life in prison, the army said in a statement.
The charges, following a seven-month investigation, include "wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the internet knowing that it will be accessed by the enemy," theft of public records, transmitting defence information and fraud related to computers, the army statement said.
"The new charges more accurately reflect the broad scope of the crimes" that Manning is accused of committing, said captain John Haberland, spokesman for the military district of Washington.
The US military had already announced 12 charges against Manning in July.
The Pentagon has yet to explicitly link him to the WikiLeaks website, but the grave charge of "aiding the enemy" raised the possibility WikiLeaks itself could be defined as the enemy.
US and Western officials have condemned WikiLeaks for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military documents and diplomatic cables over the past several months.
The WikiLeaks website has yet to disclose its source for the massive trove of secret documents, but suspicion has focused on Manning, who worked as a low-ranking army intelligence analyst in Iraq.
A trial date has yet to be set and the army says proceedings have been delayed since July 12, 2010, pending the outcome of an inquiry into the soldier's "mental capacity" requested by defence lawyers.
