In association football, Russia, recovering after Friday's abandoned Euro 2016 qualifier in Montenegro, press for UEFA to award them victory. Among the injured were goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, knocked out of the game in the first minute, concussed and nursing a neck injury after a flare struck him in the head; Dmitri Kombarov, struck by another object; Alan Dzagoev, struck by projectiles while being treated for another injury.
