India policemen suspended for 'taking bribes' in Mumbai
Thirty-six policemen in the Indian city of Mumbai have been suspended after they were allegedly filmed taking bribes, officials say.
The footage shows policemen accepting 50 rupees (92 cents; 60p) to 150 rupees ($2.75; Â£1.80) from Kasam Khan.
Mr Khan said he was carrying out building works at a friend's home in Nehru Nagar area when he was visited by policemen asking for bribes.
The footage was recorded over a two week period in March, he said.
Mumbai's police chief Satyapal Singh called it "a shameful incident" and said that the policemen if found guilty would be punished.
Authorities have ordered an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau.
Mr Khan said he installed the video camera after some policemen threatened to frame him for carrying out illegal extensions unless he paid the bribery money.
He submitted the footage to a senior police official which in turn resulted in the moves against the policemen.
This is the first time action has been taken against such a large number of policemen in Mumbai.
The force's website describes police in the city "as custodians of your trust" who strive "to enforce the law of the land impartially and firmly without fear or favour".
The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Mumbai says authorities in Maharashtra state have launched an anti-corruption drive after 74 people were killed in a recent building collapse there.
There have been allegations that a large number of illegal buildings have been built in and around Mumbai by unscrupulous builders who bribe police and local administration officials to turn a blind eye to poor safety standards, our correspondent adds.
