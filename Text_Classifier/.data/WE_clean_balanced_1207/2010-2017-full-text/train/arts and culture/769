Bond star Craig weds Oscar-winning actress Rachel Weisz
Craig, 43, the sixth actor to play the coveted secret agent role, is reported to have married Weisz, 41, at a private ceremony in New York.
Weisz won best supporting actress at the Academy Awards in 2006, for The Constant Gardener.
The British stars, who play a married couple in new film Dream House, have reportedly been dating since December.
Publicist Robin Baun, representing the James Bond actor, confirmed the pair had married, but did not offer any details.
Craig, whose revamped portrayal of James Bond in 2006's Casino Royale was critically acclaimed, will make his third outing as 007 in October 2012.
He came to public attention with roles in Layer Cake, The Mother and Enduring Love.
He is due to star in the Hollywood remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which will be released later this year.
Weisz, whose films include The Mummy, About A Boy and The Lovely Bones, was previously married to Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky, with whom she has a five-year-old son Henry.
Craig has one daughter, Ella, from his previous marriage to Fiona Loudon, which ended in 1994.
