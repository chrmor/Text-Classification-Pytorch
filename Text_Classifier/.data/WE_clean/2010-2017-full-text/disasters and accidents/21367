Cruise ship out of Boston aground in Bermuda
A cruise ship that departed from South Boston has run aground in Bermuda, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Cruise Line said.
“Norwegian Dawn temporarily lost power as the ship was departing King’s Wharf, Bermuda. The ship’s propulsion was affected and, at which time, the vessel made contact with the channel bed,” said Vanessa Picariello, a spokeswoman. “All guests and crew are safe. The ship has full power and on board services continue as scheduled.”
