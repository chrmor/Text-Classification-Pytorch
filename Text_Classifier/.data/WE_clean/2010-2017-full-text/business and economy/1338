Mass protests overshadow Greek prime minister's austerity speech
Prime minister George Papandreou's attempt to offer austerity-weary Greeks a "message of hope" in a much-awaited speech last night was eclipsed by mass demonstrations and a shoe lobbed at him by an irate protester.
As some 20,000 protestors took to the streets – launching what trade unionists have pledged will be an unprecedented winter of discontent – the socialist leader tried to persuade Greeks that belt-tightening efforts were not in vain.
"Greece is engaged in a struggle of survival … in this battle, either we win ... or we sink altogether," he told the near-bankrupt nation in a keynote speech opening Salonika's annual international trade fair. "It has been a hard, uphill, relentless battle to save our country from default, a scenario considered a given just a few months ago … but we will make it, Greece will and is going forward."
The IMF and EU – the providers of up to €110bn (£91bn) in emergency aid, the biggest bailout in western history – were not, he insisted, to blame for the debt-stricken country's chronic ills.
The measures, which have seen wage and pension cuts of up to 20%, are beginning to bite.
Many predict a backlash of civil disobedience, strikes and protests. Some 5,000 riot police were hurriedly deployed to Salonika as reports emerged that around 3,000 anarchists were also gathering.
Papandreou got a taste of the brewing anger when a disgruntled doctor threw a shoe at him earlier in the day. It missed.
