Military interrogates activist Asmaa Mahfouz, accusing her of incitement against the army
Activist and former 6 April Movement member Asmaa Mahfouz is currently being interrogated by military prosecution officers. According to the MENA news agency, Mahfouz is facing action for a Facebook status she wrote against the military.
Accusations against Mahfouz have not yet been confirmed. She is currently at the military prosecution headquarters together with several rights lawyers.
Mahfouz is not the first to be summoned by the military prosecution. Journalists Rasha Azab and Hossam El-Hamalawy as well as TV presenter Reem Maged were also interogated by the military prosecution for statements made regarding the army. 
Several of those arrested from Tahrir Square during the clashes of 28-29 June, when families of martyrs of the January 25 Revolution clashed with Central Security Forces, were also being interogated by the military prosecution Sunday. Amongst them is activist Loay Nagati, who was previously released pending investigations. Their cases were adjourned.
