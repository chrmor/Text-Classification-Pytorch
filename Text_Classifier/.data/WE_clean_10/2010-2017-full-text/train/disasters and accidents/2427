Aid agencies fear Haiti cholera moves towards capital
New suspected cholera cases in Haiti raise fears that the epidemic is moving closer to the capital Port-au-Prince as some Haitians blame UN peacekeepers for the outbreak of the disease.
Suspected cases are being investigated in three new departments, health officials report.
They said nearly 300 people were now known to have died in the cholera outbreak. Richard Forrest reports.
