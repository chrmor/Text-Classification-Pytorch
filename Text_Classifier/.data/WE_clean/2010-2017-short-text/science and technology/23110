The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), were so concerned about a study released today in The New England Journal of Medicine, that they are launching another new study about why so many people are becoming infected by or exposed to the potentially deadly Clostridium difficile ("C. diff.") bacterium after going to the doctor's or dentist's office.

His ISS year long mission is a scientific research project to study the health effects of long term spaceflight. Astronaut Michael López-Alegría spent 215 consecutive days as Expedition 14 commander in 2006. Both are nowhere close to Valeri Polyakovs 437 days record. (NBC News) (NASA)
