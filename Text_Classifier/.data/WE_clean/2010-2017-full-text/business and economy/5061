Chung Mong-koo ordered to pay Hyundai Motor $73 mln for unfair practice
By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- A Seoul court on Friday ordered Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo to pay 82.6 billion won (US$73.1 million) in compensation to his own company for inflicting damage on the top South Korean automaker by unfairly supporting Hyundai affiliates. A group of 14 minority shareholders and the NGO Solidarity for Economic Reform had filed a suit against Chung and Kim Dong-jin, vice chairman of Hyundai Mobis, an auto parts manufacturing affiliate, claiming the top executives should cough up 1.9 trillion won for losses and fines imposed on the leading automaker due to unfair practices in regard to the affiliate operation.
