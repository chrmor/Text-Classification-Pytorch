Australian woman reportedly kidnapped in Afghanistan's capital Kabul
An Australian woman working for a non-governmental organisation in Afghanistan has been reported kidnapped in the capital Kabul on Saturday (local time), officials said.
A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the embassy in Kabul was making urgent enquiries.
An Afghan television station said on Sunday the woman was abducted at gunpoint in the Qala-i-Fatullah area in the centre of the city.
Kidnapping has long been a major problem in Afghanistan, affecting Afghans more often than foreigners, with ransom often the motive.
However, there have been several abductions of foreign aid workers, including at least two Australians this year alone.
Kerry Jane Wilson, who was abducted from the office of a charity in the eastern city of Jalalabad in April, was freed in August.
Another Australian, working as a teacher at the American University in Kabul, was kidnapped with an American colleague in August.
