Two die, 80 hurt in Moscow plane accident
A passenger plane broke apart after rolling off the runway at a Moscow airport in an emergency landing on Saturday, killing two people and injuring more than 80, Russian investigators said.
The Dagestan Airlines Tupolev airliner carrying 169 people overshot the runway after crash landing at Domodedovo airport outside Moscow, with all three engines dead, authorities said.
"As a result of the accident of the Tu-154 plane, two people died," the health ministry said in a statement.
"In total, 83 people have been hospitalised."
"We are taking all necessary and possible measures to provide emergency care to the injured," Health Minister Tatyana Golikova was quoted as saying.
Golikova and Transport Minister Igor Levitin reported back to President Dmitry Medvedev on the rescue operation, the Kremlin said in a statement.
