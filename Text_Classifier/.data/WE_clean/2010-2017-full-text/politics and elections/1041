Madagascar sentences former leader in absentia
ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - A Madagascar court sentenced deposed leader Marc Ravalomanana in absentia on Saturday to forced labour for the deaths of dozens of protesters during a march on the presidential palace last year.
The verdict could open a fresh challenge to an African Union-backed effort to end the Indian Ocean island’s political crisis that followed Ravalomanana’s removal by President Andry Rajoelina.
“Marc Ravalomanana, General Heriniaina Roelina and Colonel Anatole Ramlamboarison are guilty of complicity to murder,” Raboana Rasamison Mauricette, the president of Antananarivo’s court, said.
“Each of them is condemned to a sentence of forced labour for the rest of their lives. An arrest warrant is out for them,” she added, reading out her ruling in court.
Rajoelina had called a march on the presidential palace on February 7 last year during which security forces opened fire, killing about 30 people.
Ravalomanana, who lives in exile in South Africa, was not present at the trial.
Nineteen months of political turmoil have stunted economic growth on an island known for its deposits of oil, coal, uranium, chrome, nickel and cobalt. The economy is expected to expand by a mere 0.8 percent this year after a period of steady growth.
The main opposition leaders rejected a deal signed by Rajoelina with dozens of minor parties to end the crisis.
