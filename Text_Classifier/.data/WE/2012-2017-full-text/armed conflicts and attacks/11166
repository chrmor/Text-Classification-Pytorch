“Our people did not shoot the rocket and we are committed to the ceasefire,” the group said, according to Israel Radio.
Israel closed the border with Gaza for people and goods on Sunday in response to the attack. With the Gaza-Egypt border sealed following last week’s Sinai suicide attack, which killed 31 Egyptian troops, the narrow coastal strip is effectively sealed to the world.
“This is irresponsible behavior and contrary to the understandings reached at the beginning of the ceasefire,” said Moussa Abu Marzouk, the group’s Gaza spokesman.
The rocket on Friday was the second fired into Israel from Gaza since the end of Operation Protective Edge in August.
