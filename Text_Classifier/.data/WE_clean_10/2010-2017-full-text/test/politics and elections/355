Japan PM Kan set to resign in autumn or later -TV
TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Embattled Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, at risk of losing a no-confidence vote in parliament later on Thursday, will resign in the autumn or later, private broadcaster TBS reported.
Earlier in the day the head of the tiny ruling coalition partner, the People’s New Party, had urged the unpopular premier to resign once he has extended the current parliament session and dealt with Japan’s earthquake-triggered crises, including radiation leaks at a crippled nuclear plant.
