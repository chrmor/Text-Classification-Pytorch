Northern Territory juvenile detention 'may amount to torture', says Unicef – as it happened
This is an interview from October last year, with the former NT corrections commissioner, Ken Middlebrook, on ABC Darwin. The interview took place just after the Children’s commissioner’s report was released.
Let’s cut to the chase. He seems to be misinformed, at the very least, about the level of teargassing.
Middlebrook tells ABC radio the incident needs to be “looked at in context”, and dismisses the preceding news report about the commissioner’s findings.
He accuses the report of being one-sided, unfair and unbalanced. He tells the radio host it was “very shallow and doesn’t really address the issues, and there are inaccuracies in that report”.
He defends the use of teargas against children locked in cells and again says “let’s get this into context”.
“It wasn’t tear gas canisters. There were two sprays from an aerosol into the area. That wasn’t overuse of gas.
“Nearly 38 years I’ve been a corrections officer, and I’ve used gas very few times in that 38 years … On the evening when I arrived there it was out of control.
“The picture that was painted by that grab a while ago, where there was someone running around in a common area and other kids were playing cards in a cell. Let me tell you, those other kids in those other cells, wrecked those cells to the point that they were inoperable.”
“These were fair dinkum young hoodlums,” he later said. “These young men were throwing shards of glass at staff.”
