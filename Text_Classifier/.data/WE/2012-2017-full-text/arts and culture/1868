Amy Winehouse statue planned for Camden venue
The Roundhouse, near singer's former home in north London, vows to recognise her contribution to music
A life-size bronze statue of Amy Winehouse could go on display at a music venue near her former home.
Plans are being considered for the singer, who died in her home in Camden Town, north London, to be remembered with a monument at the Roundhouse.
A venue spokesman said: "We think it's important that Amy's contribution to music is recognised in Camden, but the idea is in its early stages of development at the moment."
The Back to Black singer, who was found dead after a lengthy and very public battle with drink and drugs, was a well-known face on the Camden music scene.
Her father, Mitch, told the Camden New Journal: "It will be bronze, life-size and on the first-floor balcony next to the Roundhouse bar. What we'd like to have is Amy leaning over the balcony and looking, and perhaps pointing, towards Camden Town from Chalk Farm Road."
The singer's home was recently put up for sale by the family for Â£2.7m.
