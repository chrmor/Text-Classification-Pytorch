Senegal dismisses PM Toure after she loses Dakar vote
Parliament dismissed Toure, 51, on Friday after she failed to win a seat in local elections in the capital, Dakar, government sources told news agencies.
When she began as prime minister 10 months ago, Toure had been hailed for her dedication to women's reproductive rights internationally, her fight against corruption within Senegal and her love of football, which she played for the Dakar Gazelles. At the time, the local press had dubbed her the "Iron Lady."
