Toyota is recalling 1.43 million hybrids worldwide—Toyota Prius, Toyota Prius Plug-in, and Lexus CT200h—from model years 2010-2012 because of a possible airbag inflator defect. The company says it is not aware of any injuries or deaths related to this issue. (Reuters) (AP via U.S. News & World Report)
