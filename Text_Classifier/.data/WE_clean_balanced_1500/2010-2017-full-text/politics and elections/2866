Senate to vote on making Bible official book of Tennessee
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) â€” A contentious bill seeking to declare the Holy Bible the official book of Tennessee is headed back for a vote in the full state Senate.
The measure narrowly passed the House last year, but the Senate sent it back to committee amid constitutional concerns raised by the state attorney general.
Republican Sen. Steve Southerland of Morristown revived the measure Tuesday, and it cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 7-1 vote. Southerland said it is aimed at highlighting the historical significance of the Bible in Tennessee, not as an official endorsement of a religion.
Opponents like Republican Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey of Blountville last year argued that the Bible is far too sacred to be trivialized by being placed alongside other official symbols like the state fruit, amphibian or rock.
