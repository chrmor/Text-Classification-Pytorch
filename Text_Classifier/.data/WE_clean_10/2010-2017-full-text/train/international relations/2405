Government 'helping US track down WikiLeaks Aussies'
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has accused the Federal Government of helping the US investigate Australians involved with the website.
Speaking on SBS's Dateline program, the Australian citizen says the Federal Government is complying with US demands because it fears being held responsible for his activities.
Mr Assange says this is despite local authorities such as the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Australian Federal Police dropping their investigations.
Mr Assange is calling on Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Attorney-General Robert McClelland to reveal all the help that has been provided to foreign governments.
"There is assistance being afforded to the United States, and that is something that really needs to come out," he said.
"Gillard and McClelland need to disclose all the assistance they have afforded foreign countries against Australians involved in WikiLeaks, and the Australian registration of WikiLeaks as an entity."
Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd says every form of consular assistance has been offered to Mr Assange.
"There have been a very large number of consular contacts between our officials in the United Kingdom and Mr Assange," he said.
"We are confident we have provided the appropriate level of support for him as we would any other Australian citizen."
