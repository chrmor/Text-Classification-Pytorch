Egypt's security forces kill 9 'terrorists' during raid in 6 of October city: MOI
Egyptian security forces on Wednesday killed nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood during a raid on their hide-out apartment in the western Cairo suburb of 6 of October city, the interior ministry said.
The  ministry said in a statement on Wednesday night that police had received intelligence information that the group was planning to carry out "terrorist" attacks around the date of the second anniversary of the 30 June mass protests which led to the overthrow of former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
The officers shot the men after they opened fire on them while attempting to escape, Giza deputy security director Magdy Abd El-Aal had told told Ahram Arabic news website earlier in the evening.
The now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, which has been blamed by the government for orchestrating terrorist attacks against security forces in the last two years, denied that the men were armed.
The deadly raid came hours after militants from the Islamic State group killed dozens of soldiers and civilians in wide-scale simultaneous assaults on several military checkpoints in Egypt's North Sinai, and two days after the assassination  of the country's top prosecutor in a car bombing in Cairo.
