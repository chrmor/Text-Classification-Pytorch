Deadly shooting aboard UK submarine
One person has been killed and another seriously injured after a shooting on board a UK nuclear submarine docked at the port of Southampton in southern England, police say. One man has been arrested following the incident on the HMS Astute, which police said was notÂ "terrorism" related.
"Hampshire police were called by their Ministry of Defence colleagues at 12.12pm (11:12 GMT) today ... and are currently liaising with them to establish the exact circumstances of the incident," police said in a statement. The vessel made headlines last October when it ran aground off the coast of Scotland and had to be towed back. Local media have reported that HMS Astutewas in the middle of a five-day visit to Southampton and arrived on Wednesday carrying 98 crew members.
