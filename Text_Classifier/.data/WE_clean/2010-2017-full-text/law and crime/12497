Jerry Sandusky sentencing hearing opens with Sandusky being labeled a sexually violent predator
With little ado, Senior Judge John Cleland this morning designated former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sanduskyas a sexually violent predator under Megan's Law.
Sandusky, dressed in a bright red prison uniform, did not contest the designation that was recommendation by the state Sexual Offenders Assessment Board based on his convictions for molesting young boys.
As a predator, the 68-year-old Sandusky will have to register with police for life, if he ever gets out of prison. His neighbors also will be told of his convictions and there will be continual sex offender counseling.
Defense attorney Joe Amendola did not make a statement on the predator designation issue.
As he sat on the bench in the Centre County courtroom, Cleland ruled that there is "clear and convincing" evidence to brand Sandusky as a sex predator.
