Australia and the US agree on a spy satellite deal
AUSTRALIA and the US have formed a partnership to share top-secret intelligence from spy satellites as Australia moves to acquire a satellite to boost surveillance of Asia and the Pacific.
The agreement between Washington and Canberra provides for intensified co-operation and intelligence sharing in GEOINT, geospatial intelligence derived from imagery and other information obtained from surveillance satellites and reconnaissance aircraft.
The agreement, signed in February 2008, has been revealed in a secret US embassy cable obtained by WikiLeaks and provided exclusively to the Herald.
The cable reports that the then defence minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, and the US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, signed a "statement of principles on geospatial intelligence co-operation" at a closed session of the Australia-United States Ministerial meeting in Canberra.
The US record of the AUSMIN meeting says the agreement is designed "to take GEOINT co-operation to the same level that signals intelligence has reached between the two countries.''
The US and Australia have long worked closely together under the United Kingdom-United States Agreement that governs signals intelligence co-operation among the US, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
