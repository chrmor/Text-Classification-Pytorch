Volleyball-Brazil beat Cuba to seal third straight world title
ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Brazil hammered Cuba 3-0 to secure their third straight world men’s volleyball championship on Sunday after a highly successful tournament in Italy.
The South Americans, dressed in their traditional yellow and blue and roared on by Brazil and Inter Milan soccer player Lucio in the Rome arena, took the final set 25-22 thanks to a winning shot from the consistently excellent Leandro Vissotto. He fell to the ground in ecstasy after securing victory in a largely one-sided final.
Cuba had beaten Brazil 3-2 in the first round and finished above their rivals in Pool B.
“Psychologically it was a equal game for both teams because Brazil with the pressure have to win and Cuba have a young team that were in this position for the first time.”
Hosts Italy earlier lost the third/fourth place playoff to Serbia 3-1. The tournament, spread across Italy, has gained high viewing figures with the top matches often sold out. The next world championship takes place in Poland in 2014 but before that the United States, who were rebuilding during the worlds, will try to retain their Olympic gold medal at London 2012.
