According to a statement released Sunday by Sony Pictures Television, “Trebek is in good spirits and is currently under observation and undergoing further testing. He is expected to fully recover and be back at Jeopardy!when production begins taping in July for the new season, the show's 29th.”
Trebek suffered a heart attack in December 2007, after which he returned to Jeopardy! in a matter of weeks. He also was injured July 27, 2011, while pursuing a burglar in his hotel room in San Francisco. After snapping his Achilles tendon, he wore a cast for six weeks.
Trebek, 71, has hosted Jeopardy! since 1984, and his contract recently was extended until 2014. Speaking to THR at the Peabody Awards in May, Trebek said that his dream job would be hosting Hollywood Squares.
