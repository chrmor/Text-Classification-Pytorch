United States Wins FIBA World Cup Title in a Rout of Serbia
MADRID — Kenneth Faried preened from atop a folding chair. Anthony Davis grabbed the assistant coach Monty Williams in a bear hug. James Harden leapt onto DeMarcus Cousins’s back. The names may have been considerably different from those at the London Olympics, but the outcome for the United States national basketball team was the same: another championship.
This time it was the FIBA Basketball World Cup, and when the Americans’ 129-92 pasting of Serbia in Sunday’s final was complete, the players gathered together and danced. The United States became just the third country to win consecutive world titles and extended its winning streak in international play to 63 games.
The Americans shredded their way through the tournament, dominating all nine games and never winning by fewer than 21 points. In the final, they did not even need three full quarters to top 100 points (they had 105 entering the fourth quarter). It was an offensive explosion that many observers did not foresee, if only because the United States was without so many of its most recognizable stars.
LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, who were mainstays in London, decided early on that they were going to sit out the event. Other big names, including Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, also pulled out, and Paul George sustained a horrific leg injury during an exhibition game that ruled him out. Talk of the United States possibly being knocked out, as it was in the 2006 World Championships, percolated. At the very least, it was assumed that the presumed matchup in the final with host Spain would be a dodgy proposition.
