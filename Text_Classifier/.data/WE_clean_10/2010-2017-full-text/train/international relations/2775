U.S. says Afghan peace deal must ensure women's rights
AfghanistanTaliban WASHINGTON  As Afghanistan prepares to open a peace conference aimed at persuading Taliban leaders to put down their weapons, U.S. lawmakers have made clear that they want women's rights preserved in any potential deal to integrate former insurgents into the government. About 1,600 Afghans — including lawmakers, tribal and religious leaders — will convene in a tent at Kabul Polytechnic University for a peace jirga on ways to get insurgents to stop battling the government of President Hamid Karzai. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., who went to Afghanistan as part of a congressional delegation, said she wants to ensure that women's rights aren't set aside during the conference, which begins Wednesday. "He faces a really tremendous challenge," Edwards said of Karzai. "At the same time, he has a constitution. ... Women's participation is a bottom line." During the Taliban's rule of Afghanistan, women lived under severe restrictions. Women weren't allowed to work outside of the home, and girls were prohibited from going to school. The Taliban required women to wear a head-to-toe veil, and they risked a beating if they were caught in public with a man who wasn't a close relative. Karzai will offer jobs to mid- and low-level Taliban members plus aid for their villages if they lay down their arms, according to the draft of his jirga offer obtained by the Associated Press. The Afghanistan Peace and Reconciliation Program would be supported by $160 million from the U.S., Japan, Britain and others. Insurgents must renounce violence, vow to respect the Afghan constitution and sever ties with al-Qaeda or other terrorist networks, according to Karzai's offer. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander, said the jirga offer appeared "very, very responsible." Abdullah Abdullah, the most prominent Afghan opposition leader, said the peace conference offers only "false hope" that members of the Taliban are willing to embrace democracy. "The core of the problem is that they're not looking to have a part in a power-sharing system, but they are looking to reverse the system itself," Abdullah said. "If anything, the Taliban have become more hard-line," he said. "On issues of women, on human rights, on education ... not on one of these things that are part of the democratic process have they softened." In Washington last month, Karzai said at least 20% of the participants in the jirga will be women. Edwards said Afghan officials told her during her Kabul visit that women would play a meaningful role in the conference, and more than half of the breakout meetings would be led by women. "It would be most unfortunate for us, and for our values, if we allowed (the jirga) to happen without engaging women in a way that's consistent with the constitution," she said. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. wouldn't back any plan between the government and militants that diminished women's rights. It is "essential that women's rights and women's opportunities are not sacrificed or trampled on in the reconciliation process," she said.
