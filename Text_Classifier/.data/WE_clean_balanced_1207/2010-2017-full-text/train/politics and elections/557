Scottish, North Irish MEPs want their countries to stay in EU 
Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson told the European Parliament plenary today that her party respects and defends the wishes of people of the north of Ireland, but that if English votes "drag us out of Europe", that would be like "Britainnia waives the rules".
We voted to remain in the European Union, she told the MEPs. Martina Anderson reminded her colleagues the EU has supported in the past the peace process in Northern Ireland and she asked them to do the same thing again.
