India pledges $1 bln quake aid to Nepal
KATHMANDU, June 25 (Reuters) - India pledged $1 billion for earthquake reconstruction in Nepal on Thursday, with a quarter of the amount in the form of grants, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told a donor conference also attended by China.
Swaraj said the $1 billion was over and above India's existing aid pledges to Nepal.
"This takes our total assistance to Nepal over the next five years to $2 billion U.S. dollars," she said. (Reporting by Gopal Sharma; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)
