Ford Fiesta recalled for airbag problem: The littlest Ford gets a big recall
A side curtain airbag problem has prompted Ford to recall Fiesta subcompacts from the 2011-2013 model years. The recall covers vehicles built between Nov. 2, 2009, and Sept. 21, 2012—a little more than 154,000 cars.
According to a report issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the passenger side curtain airbag in the recalled cars will not deploy in a side impact if the front passenger seat is vacant.
While Ford designed the airbag system to work in such a circumstance, the Fiesta's owner's manual didn't spell out the specifics. This means the cars are out of compliance with government safety standards.
Ford says that the fix involves a software update that enables the side curtain airbag even if the passenger seat is not occupied, bringing it in line with the owner's manual.
