Gunman Opens Fire During 'Trainwreck' Screening
A gunman killed two people and wounded nine others after standing up and opening fire about 20 minutes into a movie in Lafayette, Louisiana, police said.
Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft said the 58-year-old man used a handgun and took his own life when officers arrived at the scene within about a minute.
Dee Stanley, chief administrative officer of the city about 50 miles southwest of Baton Rouge, told MSNBC TV that some of the wounded were in "very critical" condition with life-threatening injuries.
The ages of the victims range from late teens to 60s, according to Craft.
The gunman was sitting in the Grand Theatre 16 "just like everybody else" before shooting randomly during a screening of the movie "Trainwreck" at about 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), Craft said.
He added: "The information we have at this time indicates that he was by himself, he sat by himself and the first two people he shot were sitting right in front of him ... When he stood up and started firing, people started rushing out. It looks like he spotted the officers coming in and he turned around, went against the crowd and fired a single gunshot."
Officials said the gunman had a "criminal history" but declined to immediately release his name.
"We don’t believe there’s anybody else involved," Louisiana State Police Col. Michael Edmonson told reporters. There were approximately 100 people inside the theater at the time, he added.
Authorities have located what they believe is the gunman's car and called in the bomb squad after "suspicious" items were seen inside, Edmonson told reporters.
