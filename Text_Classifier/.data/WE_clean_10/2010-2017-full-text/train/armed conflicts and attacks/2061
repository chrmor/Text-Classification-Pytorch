Beirut (AFP) - US-led air strikes killed at least 120 jihadists in Syria on Tuesday, a monitoring group said.
The dead included more than 70 members of the Islamic State (IS) group in the north and east of Syria, as well as 50 Al-Qaeda militants, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
