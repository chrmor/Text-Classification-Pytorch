Homestar Runner Gets Updated After Being Dormant Since 2010
Homestar Runner has been dormant since late 2010, but it’s back. Hopefully “back” means more than this lone update, but we’ll see.
Aside from the various sites I’ve worked at over the years, I can safely say that HomestarRunner.com is the site I’ve sunk the most time into. That it hasn’t been updated in three and a half years is sad, but there’s just so much there already. I’m baffled that the Chapman brothers were able to keep it going for as long as they did.
As far as the most recent update goes, everyone’s favorite walking speech impediment plays host to a slew of additions to various blasts from the past – the payoff at the end is a pair of downloadable Homestar and Strong Bad themes for Windows 98. Yes, Windows 98 – complete with desktop backgrounds, icons, startup and shutdown sounds, and more.
We’ll see if this is a sign of more to come. I hope it is, but I’ll understand if it isn’t. If it’s an issue of funding, sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo didn’t exist back in Homestar’s heyday, and the Chapman boys could probably raise a small fortune nowadays if they wanted to resurrect the site for good.
Here’s a fun TIME-themed diversion, too: At the end of Strong Bad Email #202, click on the words “duct tape him to the ceiling” to get a peek at Strong Sad and his imaginary friend playing TIME Magazine: The Game. “Spiro Agnew’s favorite slacks! That’s right!”
