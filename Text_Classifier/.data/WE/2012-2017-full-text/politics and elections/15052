US to increase freedom of navigation patrols as China responds
Beijing: The US Navy plans to conduct freedom of navigation patrols within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea about twice a quarter, according to a US defence official, risking a further escalation of tensions in the disputed waters.
"We're going to come down to about twice a quarter or a little more than that," said the unnamed official cited by Reuters.
"That's the right amount to make it regular but not a constant poke in the eye. It meets the intent to regularly exercise our rights under international law and remind the Chinese and others about our view."
White House national security adviser Ben Rhodes said on Monday there would be more demonstrations of the US commitment to freedom of navigation.
