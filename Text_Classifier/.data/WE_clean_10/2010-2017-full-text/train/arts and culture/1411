1 in 3 'believes in guardian angels'
Nearly a third of Britons believe they have a guardian angel, a survey from the Bible Society and Christian Research claims.
In a poll of 1,038 people, 5 per cent said they had seen or heard an angel; 29 per cent believed a guardian angel was watching over them. The highest level of belief was in London, with 40 per cent. The North-east had the lowest, at 17 per cent.
Researchers warned that city-by-city results were based on small numbers â€“ as low as 17 in Oxford.
