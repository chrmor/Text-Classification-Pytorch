Kenya minister steps aside over saga
“I want to tell Kenyans with a clear conscience that I have this afternoon made the decision to step aside from my responsibility and appointment as the Minister of Foreign Affairs to give room and pleasure to those who have been tormenting and haunting me for three four weeks and give room to the very able arms of investigations to carry out their investigations,” he said during a news conference at the Ministry's office in Nairobi.
“I want to thank you because you’ve given me the publicity I have never had in my whole life, perhaps I will never have… the publicity that every politician desires to have. Even those who didn’t know me do so now,” he said.
“The only thing I must do is to step aside and give my appointing authority, the President... an opportunity to have a free hand to address this issue. I’m sure he does not want to have a corrupt minister in his fold.”
"I have consciously taken this decision as an expression of my confidence that at the conclusion of the on-going investigations by the Kenya Anti Corruption Commission, the appropriateness of my engagement with all aspects of the operations pertaining to this matter will undoubtedly be established," he said in a statement.
“It’s a matter that should never have happened. But, in a way, it is something that was inevitable. When accusations are made against a leader, it’s time that they come out and step aside, so that if investigations are done and you’re innocent, you come in better and people respect you,” Mr Onyonka told journalists at Kenya’s Parliament, within half-an-hour of the minister’s resignation..
“At any time when you are a leader and there are doubts and questions about you, then people are very uncomfortable with you," he said. “For me, Thuita Mwangi (the permanent secretary) and the minister were my friends and I’ll miss them when they’ll be away.”
