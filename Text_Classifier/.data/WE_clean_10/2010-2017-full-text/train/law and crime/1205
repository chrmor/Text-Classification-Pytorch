Cambodia's exiled opposition leader on trial again
Cambodia's exiled opposition leader has been tried in absentia on charges of conspiring to incite chaos through false documents posted on his Facebook page, a crime punishable by up to 17 years in prison.
Two other opposition members, who ran and maintained Sam Rainsy's Facebook page, also were tried on the same charges - conspiracy to falsify public documents, inciting chaos and using fake documents. The two fled Cambodia in August 2015 to avoid arrest. Sam Rainsy, the president of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, lives in exile in France. Â 
After a brief hearing Friday that included statements by the prosecutor and the defense, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court adjourned the trial and set the verdict for Dec. 22.
