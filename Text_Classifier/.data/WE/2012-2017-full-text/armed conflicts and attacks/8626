Gunmen Wound 7 Thai Protesters
Authorities in Thailand's capital say at least seven men have been wounded in two attacks on anti-government protesters. Police say one attack in Bangkok occurred during the early morning hours of Saturday and left two men wounded. A separate attack hours later wounded five men. Officials say at least one of the victims was a security guard with the protesters. The protesters, led by ex-deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban, aim to paralyze the capital Monday with mass demonstrations that will block main highways and prevent government offices from functioning. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has dissolved parliament, called for early elections, and proposed the formation of a national reform council as a way to resolve the months-long political crisis. But the opposition has said this is not enough, saying reforms must take place before the February 2 snap elections, which analysts say the prime minister's ruling party is likely to win. Demonstrators view Yingluck as a puppet of her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, a billionaire businessman, was ousted in a 2006 military coup. He was convicted of corruption and lives in self-imposed exile.
