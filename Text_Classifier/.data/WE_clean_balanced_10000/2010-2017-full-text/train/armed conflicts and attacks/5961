UK authorities arrest suspect in US DoD cyber attack
LONDON (AP) â€” Britain's National Crime Agency says a suspected hacker has been arrested in connection with a cyber attack on the U.S. Department of Defense.
The agency said Friday the 23-year-old man arrested in western England is suspected of offenses linked to data stolen from a messaging service used by DoD employees.
The agency says contact information for around 800 people was obtained in the attack in June.
The hacker posted screenshots from the dashboard used to control the database and also posted a message on the text storage website Pastebin reading, "We smite the Lizards, LizardSquad your time is near. We're in your bases, we control your satellites."
The agency says no sensitive data was obtained and that it did not threaten national security.
