"The best thing for that man is to be forgotten," said Kerry Cahill, daughter of Michael Cahill, 62, the only civilian killed in the attacks.

He also offered no explanation for his refusal to mount any defense in either the trial or sentencing phases. Judge Tara Osborn, an Army colonel, reluctantly granted his wishes, again telling Hasan, "You're the captain of your own ship."
