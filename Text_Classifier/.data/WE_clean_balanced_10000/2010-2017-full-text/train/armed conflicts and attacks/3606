Japan marks Nagasaki atomic bomb attack of 1945
Japan has marked the 65th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in 1945.
The attack killed more than 70,000 people and led to Japan's surrender less than a week later.
The United States sent its ambassador for the first time to the memorial ceremony in Hiroshima last week, but not to Nagasaki.
A choir of survivors of the nuclear attack performed a song as the ceremony began, called Never Again.
At two minutes past eleven a bell tolled, to mark the moment the bomb fell on Nagasaki 65 years ago.
Among the survivors and the families of the dead were the representatives of more than 30 countries.
They heard Nagasaki's mayor call for the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Although the US Ambassador to Japan, John Roos, attended the ceremony at Hiroshima, he did not attend the memorial in Nagasaki.
Japan's surrender brought an end to the war in the Pacific.
