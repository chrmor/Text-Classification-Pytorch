News: Foreign Ministers agree to sustain NATO-led mission in Afghanistan beyond 2016, 20-May.-2016
Foreign Ministers from the nations participating in Resolute Support agreed today (20 May 2016) to sustain the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan beyond 2016 in a sign of strong commitment to the stability of the country.
“The Afghan forces are showing real courage, determination, and professionalism; and they are benefitting from our training, advice and assistance; but Afghanistan continues to face serious security challenges. That is why today, ministers agreed to sustain the Resolute Support mission beyond 2016. Our military authorities will now address the details of the mission beyond 2016, including in the regions of Afghanistan”, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.
Ministers also reviewed financial support for the Afghan security forces, with total contributions to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund now exceeding 1.4 billion US dollars.
“I am confident that we will be able to announce at the Warsaw Summit firm commitments to continue funding the Afghan forces through the year 2020. This is critical for Afghanistan’s ability to build sustainable security forces and ensure Afghanistan’s lasting security. Ministers also reaffirmed our long-term ambition for a strong political partnership and practical cooperation with Afghanistan,” Mr. Stoltenberg added.
The Afghan Foreign Minister expressed his appreciation for NATO Allies and Partners’ continued support to Afghanistan and briefed the Ministers on the Afghan National Unity Government’s continuing reforms to fight corruption, protect human rights and advance the peace process.
Today’s meeting was an important stepping stone towards the NATO Summit in Warsaw, as Ministers made clear that the Allies and Partners’ political, military and financial support for Afghanistan will endure.
The United Nations Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, the Secretary General of the European Union External Action Service and high level officials from Japan and South Korea also attended the meeting of Foreign Ministers from the Resolute Support mission.
