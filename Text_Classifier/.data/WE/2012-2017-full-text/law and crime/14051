Patel OBC quota protest turns violent; Gujarat Home Minister Rajni Patel's house torched
During the ongoing Patel OBC quota protests in Gujarat, the house of Gujarat Minister of State of Home Rajni Patel in Mehsana was also torched by the agitators. Although, Mehsana police said that the fire did not cause much damage. 
Police took away Hardik Patel, the campaign leader, and his supporters after lathi-charging his over 2,000 supporters. But the young leader's detention late in the evening led to an immediate backlash, as protesters gathered in large numbers at various cross-roads and attacked the police, pelted stones and set on fire public properties including buses at two places.
In her public message, Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel stated that she expressed regret over today's incidents and that her government will set up an inquiry to find out the truth behind them. She also said that necessary action will be taken against those found guilty in the inquiry.
Anandiben also appealed to maintain peace as members of Patel community resorted to violence over the issue across the city. "My sincere appeal to the people of Gujarat to maintain peace and not to indulge in activities disrupting the law and order across the state," she said in her message.
Protestors also set two motorbikes on fire and damaged public property at Shahibaug area of Ahmedabad after the release of their leader Hardik Patel. The protestors also damaged public property and set a bus on fire in Surat.
