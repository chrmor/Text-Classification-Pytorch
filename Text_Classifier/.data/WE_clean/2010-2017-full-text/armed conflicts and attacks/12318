Suicide bombers kill 14 in Somali capital Mogadishu
A Somali police official says a suicide bomber killed 14 people when he detonated his explosives at a Mogadishu cafe frequented by politicians and journalists in the capital.
Police Col. Mohammed Dahair said this evening's explosion happened at a cafe near the seat of government. He could not immediately say how many others were wounded.
A second police official, Abdiwali Hassan, said three journalists were among those killed. He did not know if any prominent politicians were among the dead.
The attack was likely carried out by the militant group al-Shabab which has been fighting the Somali government for nearly five years. Africa Union forces pushed the al-Qa'ida affiliated group out of Mogadishu in August 2011 but the militants have continued to carry out suicide attacks in the capital.Â
