At least 8 injured by lightning at German festival
MENDIG, Germany (AP) â€” At least eight people were hospitalized after lightning struck a rock festival in western Germany on Friday police said, the second straight year lightning has injured fans at the Rock am Ring festival.
Police spokesman Lars Brummer told The Associated Press that rescuers had to revive one person who was struck by lightning at the popular festival near Mendig, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Frankfurt.
Brummer said a severe thunderstorm had moved over the festival site at a former airfield shortly after 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) Friday evening. He said organizers warned festival-goers to seek shelter during the storm.
Spiegel magazine, citing police, reported on its website that "many" people were injured but that it was unclear exactly how many were hurt or how badly.
Brummer said the festival has since resumed.
Last year, at least 33 people were injured when lightning struck the festival twice.
Tens of thousands of rock fans attend the event annually. American band Tenacious D was scheduled to play Friday evening, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing Saturday.
