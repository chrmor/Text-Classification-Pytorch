Israel re-opens embassy in Egypt
Israel re-opened its embassy in Egypt on Wednesday four years to the day after protesters stormed the embassy, forcing Israeli diplomats to leave Cairo, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry statement.
A delegation led by Foreign Ministry Director General Dore Gold visited Cairo Wednesday for an official ceremony marking the re-opening of the embassy.
"Under the leadership of PM Benjamin Netanyahu and the President of Egypt, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, we have succeeded in pushing off the threats and we are working together in order to bring stability and economic prosperity to the Middle East," Gold is quoted in the statement as saying.
"Egypt will always be the biggest and most important country in our region, and it is no wonder that in the Arab world, people are accustomed to calling Egypt 'The mother of the world.' "
On September 9, 2011, thousands of protesters tore down a protective wall surrounding the Israeli Embassy and ransacked the embassy offices. In response, Israel pulled its diplomatic staff out of Egypt. A month earlier, Israeli soldiers killed five Egyptian police officers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border. Following the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, many Egyptians had called on the government to end diplomatic relations with Israel. Egypt and Israel signed a peace agreement in 1979.
