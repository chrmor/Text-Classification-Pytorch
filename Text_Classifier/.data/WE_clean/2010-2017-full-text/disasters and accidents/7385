Thousands remain isolated as floodwaters ease
More than 16,000 residents remain isolated and 3350 people are waiting to return to their homes as floods gradually ease on the NSW mid north coast.
A much-needed period of dry weather has been forecast for the worst affected areas, but floodwaters are expected to be slow to recede, the State Emergency Service (SES) says.
About 16,340 people in the Kempsey and Taree areas remain isolated after torrential rain battered the coast throughout the week.
A further 3350 people - evacuated from a slew of towns including Smithtown, Jerseyville, Kinchela and Gladstone - were today waiting for an all-clear so they could return to their homes.
SES spokesman Dave Owens said the situation wouldbe reviewed, but there was no timeframe for when residents might be able to return to their homes.
