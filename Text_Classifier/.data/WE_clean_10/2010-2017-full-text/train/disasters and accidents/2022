Â death toll rises to 142 with hopes fading for survivors
The death toll from India'srail disaster rose to 142 on Monday after workers toiled through the night removing victims from the wreckage, with grim warnings that more bodies were trapped inside.
There was little hope of finding survivors among the mangled remains of 14 carriages, which came off the tracks on Sunday in a rural district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
"The actual toll will still be higher and it would be a difficult task to identify all the persons, particularly those whose bodies are very badly damaged," a senior local government official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"We do not have an exact figure for the injured as of now. Rescue work is still going on," said district police chief Zaki Ahmad as workers cleared the most severely damaged carriages.
