Chad migrants 'stranded' in Libyan border badlands
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has expressed concern about more than 2,000 Chadian people stranded on Libya's border with Chad.
It says that they are camping in an arid and hostile area renowned for banditry.
The IOM says that most of them are women, children and the elderly - trying to flee fighting in the country.
The organisation says it is making arrangements for them to be airlifted.
The IOM's Dr Qasim Sufi said: "Conditions for them are brutal in the desert heat with no protection from the sun, wind or sand and no access to water, food or sanitation."
The IOM said the group was camping near the southern towns of Gatroun and Sebha.
About 40,000 Chadians have fled the country throughout the southern route despite the harsh terrain, the IOM says.
