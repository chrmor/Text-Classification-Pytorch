Michael Jace, star of The Shield, arrested after shooting death of his wife in Los Angeles
US film and television actor Michael Jace was arrested early on Tuesday after allegedly shooting his wife dead, police said, while media reports said he had confessed.
The 51-year-old, famous for the police drama series The Shield, was detained “for the killing of his wife of nine years, April,” said Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective Lyman Doster.
The LAPD was treating the shooting as a murder related to domestic violence, he added. Two children were in the house at the time of the killing.
Jace has also appeared in films, including Forrest Gump, Boogie Nights and Planet of the Apes. The TV series The Shieldfollowed a movie of the same name in which he played officer Julien Lowe.
