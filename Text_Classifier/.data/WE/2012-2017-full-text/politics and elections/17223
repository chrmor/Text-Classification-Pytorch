SEOUL, April 1 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Friday launched a projectile presumed to be a ballistic missile, the South Korean military said, in the latest show of defiance by the communist country against mounting international pressure to give up its nuclear program.
The North fired off a projectile at around 1 p.m at the country's northeast area, according to a military official.
The military is analyzing the trajectory of the projectile, saying that the object is presumed to be a ballistic missile, he added.
