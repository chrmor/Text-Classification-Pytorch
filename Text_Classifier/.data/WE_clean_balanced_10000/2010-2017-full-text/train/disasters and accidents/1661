Army removes WWII bomb near London's Wembley Stadium
LONDON (AP) — British police say the army has safely removed an unexploded World War II bomb found near London's Wembley Stadium.
The 50-kilogram (110-pound) bomb was discovered Thursday by workers at a construction site near the stadium. It is believed to have been dropped over London during German bombing raids in the early 1940s.

The 50-kilogram (110-pound) bomb was discovered by workers at a construction site near Wembley stadium. It is believed to have been dropped over London during German bombing raids in the early 1940s.
The discovery of the device prompted police to evacuate hundreds of people from their homes and offices, as army bomb disposal experts worked through the night to try to defuse the bomb. A blast wall was built around the site in case of an accidental explosion.
Wembley Stadium said this weekend's Football League playoffs would go ahead as planned.
A bigger WWII bomb was found in southeast London in March and safely defused.
