Aretha Franklin announces stage comeback
Singer Aretha Franklin has announced she is to return to the stage in May, months after being admitted to hospital for an undisclosed ailment.
The 68-year-old - who also has plans to release a new album - will perform at the Seneca Niagara Casino in Buffalo, New York on 28 May.
Last November Franklin cancelled all concerts and public appearances for six months under doctor's orders.
The following month she had what she described as "more than minor surgery".
Since then the "queen of soul" has revamped her diet and lost weight.
"I want to not only maintain the weight I am at now, but better it by one dress size," she told the Associated Press news agency.
In January she told US magazine Jet that she was "feeling great" and her medical condition had been resolved.
Last weekend saw Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Florence Welch and others perform a tribute to Franklin at this year's Grammy awards.
