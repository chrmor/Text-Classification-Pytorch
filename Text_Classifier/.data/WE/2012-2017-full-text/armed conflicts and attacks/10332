'100 die' as Syria gas field seized
Militants from the Islamic State group attacked army checkpoints and seized the Shaer gas field in the desert region of Palmyra, according to Beibares Tellawi, an activist in the central province of Homs.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 115 people were killed. The Syrian government has not commented and an official in Homs said he had no information on the incident.
The Observatory and Mr Tellawi said the field fell to the militants last night after a day of clashes.
