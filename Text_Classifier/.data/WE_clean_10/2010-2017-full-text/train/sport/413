Lionel Messi announces international football retirement after Argentina loses Copa America final
Argentina superstar Lionel Messi says he is finished with the national team after the side's loss to Chile in the Copa America final.
The five-time world player of the year announced as much in the immediate aftermath of Argentina's gut-wrenching loss to Chile, 4-2 in a penalty shootout on Monday (AEST).
"The national team is done for me," Messi told reporters.
The 29-year-old was booked for simulation and sent his attempt over the crossbar in the decisive shootout as he fell short for the fourth time in a major international final.
"It's difficult, it's a hard moment for any analysis. In the dressing room I thought that the national team is not for me," he added.
In the Copa semi-final win over the USA, Messi curled in a free-kick to become Argentina's most prolific goal scorer.
But after the game, Messi hammered Argentina's Football Association (AFA), calling it "a disaster" after a flight delay.
The AFA explained the delay was caused by inclement weather, but it is believed Messi's issues with the governing body go much deeper.
There was some speculation from Messi's team-mates that his announcement was more in the heat of the moment than anything else.
"I don't think he's thought about it properly ... I don't imagine a national team without Messi," goalkeeper Sergio Romero was reported as saying.
Manchester City star Sergio Aguero also said his skipper had not told him of any plans to retire.
"Sadly, the one who's taking this the worst is Leo," he said.
"It's the worst I've seen him in the dressing room."
Messi's Argentina and Barcelona team-mate, Javier Mascherano, also announced he had played his last game for the national side and there were reports Aguero was also calling time on his international career.
