Higgs Boson theorists receive Nobel Prize in physics
Higgs bosondiscovered last year The Higgs boson , or the "God particle," which was discovered last year , garnered two physicists the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday, but it didn't go to the scientists who detected it.
As is tradition, the academy phoned the scientists during the announcement to inform them of their win. They were unable to reach Higgs, for whom the particle is named.
The fact that the prize was awarded to the theorists so soon after the particle's existence was detected by experimenters is a confirmation of the value of their contribution, Incandela said.
the Large Hadron Collider The July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson in the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, has been billed as one of the biggest scientific achievements of the past 50 years.
looked even more like the Higgs boson On March 14, what would have been Albert Einstein's birthday, they announced that, over time, the particle they found looked even more like the Higgs boson they had been chasing for almost 50 years.
Many scientists dislike the term "God particle," even though it's become popular in the media. The nickname came from the title of a book by Leon Lederman, who reportedly wanted to call it the "Goddamn Particle" since it was so hard to find.
Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in physics 107 times, including this year's award. The youngest recipient was Lawrence Bragg, who won in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate; he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel Prize area.
Americans James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize Monday for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce.
