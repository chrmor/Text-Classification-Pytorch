Czech prime minister announces he will resign after top aid is charged with bribery
PRAGUE - Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas says he will resign because a top aide of his has been charged with abuse of power.
Necas' decision, announced Sunday night, will end his three-party coalition government, which was created after the 2010 parliamentary election. But Necas said he hopes it can stay in power until a parliamentary election planned next year.
He said he will resign as prime minister and chairman of his conservative Civic Democratic Party on Monday.
Necas' decision came after his closest aide, Jana Nagyova, was arrested this week for allegedly ordering a military intelligence agency to spy on the leader's estranged wife and seven other people, including three former lawmakers of his party were arrested and face bribery and abuse of power charges.
