Online calls for 'Jasmine revolution' continue in China
BEIJING: China saw a reemergence of Internet postings calling for a revival of protests in the name of ‘jasmine revolution’ that was crushed by local authorities in 13 cities before it took a big shape last Sunday. The new online statement demanded the release of dissidents, who have been detained, and gave a call to fight the “corrupt political system”. Several Internet sites including Twitter carries postings and photographs from lawyers and human rights activists saying that people have been detained for "inciting subversion of state power" in different cities including Shanghai and Harbin in north China. Several others are under house arrests in different parts of the country even as the censors continued to strengthen their grip over the Internet, the postings complained. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday Chinese people crave social and political stability and want to live and work in peace and contentment. "This is something that no person or force can shake," Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. Most of the people and groups sending out statements asking for a repeat of the ‘Jasmine revolution’ in the Middle East have remained anonymous with no one coming forward to claim responsibility. Even human rights groups said they were unaware of who is making the postings. But there are signs some of the postings have managed to sneak through the tight censorship controls and reach young people in colleges and universities. "Media censorship is strict. Media people with conscience are losing their jobs. Constitutional rights are only in paper rather than in practice.... We think the root causes of all this lies in the authoritarian regime," a statement issued by an anonymous group calling itself ‘jasmine revolution’ said.
