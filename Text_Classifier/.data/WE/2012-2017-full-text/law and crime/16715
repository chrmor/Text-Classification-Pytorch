Pakistan Hangs Killer Of Reformist Governor
Pakistan has hanged a man convicted of murdering a provincial governor in 2011 after the official called for reform of the country's strict blasphemy laws.
Mumtaz Qadriâ€™s execution in the city of Rawalpindi on February 29 triggered protests by thousands of the killer's supporters in several cities, including Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad.
The funeral is expected to be held on February 30.
Qadri, who was considered a hero by many Islamists, was a former bodyguard to Punjab Governor Salman Taseer.
He confessed to killing Taseer in response to his calls to reform strict blasphemy laws that carry a death sentence for insulting Islam.
Qadri shot Taseer 28 times at a market in Islamabad in broad daylight.
The judge who oversaw Qadri's trial was forced to flee the country after receiving death threats.
