Iran invites UN human rights chief
UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-Moon is welcoming Iran's invitation for a visit next year by the United Nations' human rights chief.
The UN spokesman's office said in a written summary that Mohammad Javed Larijani, Iranian secretary-general for human rights, made the invitation during a Friday meeting with Ban.
The UN General Assembly's human rights committee on Thursday condemned Iran's rights record, especially for punishments that include stoning, flogging and amputations.
The committee also urged Iran to work with UN rights agencies to include its record, including the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, a position currently held by South African jurist Navi Pillay.
