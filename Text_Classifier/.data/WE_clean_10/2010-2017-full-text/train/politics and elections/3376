Pakistan on strike against bill to amend blasphemy law
A 24-hour strike organised by Sunni Muslim clerics has taken place across Pakistan to protest against possible changes to blasphemy laws.
Rallies were staged in Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta after Friday prayers.
The government has distanced itself from a bill to soften the law, which currently carries a mandatory death sentence for anyone who insults Islam.
Human rights groups say the law is often used to persecute religious minorities.
