Suicide Bomber in Istanbul Kills Officer at Police Station
ISTANBUL — A suicide bomber wearing a large coat that concealed her explosives attacked a police station in the heart of Istanbul’s most tourist-filled district on Tuesday, killing herself and wounding two police officers, one fatally.
It was the second attack on the police in this city in less than a week, and the first time in more than four years that a suicide bomber had struck such a heavily visited part of Istanbul. The attack was also reminiscent of a suicide bomb assault on the United States Embassy in Ankaranearly two years ago.
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Ankara that he had “given instructions for the most comprehensive investigations.” The Turkish news media said that two police officers were wounded and that one of them had died.
The identity of the bomber was not immediately clear, but the Istanbul governor, Vasip Sahin, told reporters at the scene that she had spoken English. She told police officers she had lost a wallet, the governor said.
The attack took place on a snowy day in the historic city’s Sultanahmet district, home to some of the most storied and heavily trafficked visitor sites in Istanbul, including the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia Museum, which was once the leading church of Eastern Orthodox Christians.
