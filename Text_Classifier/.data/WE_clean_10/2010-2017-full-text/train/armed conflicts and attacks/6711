Jewish Man Stabbed by Fellow Israeli in Botched Revenge Attack Denounces Ethnic Violence
A Jewish man who was mistaken for an Arab and stabbed by a fellow Israeli Jew bent on avenging recent knife attacks in Israel denounced ethnically motivated violence in interviews with the local news media.
Uri Rezken, the victim of the botched revenge attack, was stabbed in the back on Tuesday as he worked at a market in the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Ata.
“I’m working, and suddenly I feel four knife stabs in my back,” he told Israel’s Army Radio on Wednesday. “I heard a shout, ‘You deserve it, you deserve it, Arab bastards!’ When I turn around I see a Haredi man. I shouted to him, ‘I’m a Jew,’ but he tried to continue. I just ran away; otherwise I would have been killed.”
