Myanmar's Rohingya forced back to sea
Thousands of Muslims have been escaping from Myanmar after dozens were killed in religious violence.
They are fleeing attacks in Rakhine state by the Buddhist majority. Many have tried to reach Bangladesh, where their ancestors are from.
However, some Rohingya who reached Bangladesh by boat were turned away by the border guards, who gave them a bottle of water and some food, and forced them back to sea, despite appeals from the UN.
