Pyongyang Threatens to End Venture
After a long barrage of words and gestures, Pyongyang threatens its first major action against South Korea, declaring it will withdraw its 53,000 workers from an industrial park jointly run with the South. The WSJ's Alastair Gale tells Mariko Sanchanta why this is significant to inter-Korean relations.
SEOULâ€”North Korea withdrew its workers from an industrial park jointly run with South Korea and said it is considering closing the complex permanently. That would leave the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation close to collapse and mark a significant exacerbation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The move, coming as Seoul continues to face a barrage of war threats from the North, provides a fresh challenge for new South Korean President Park Geun-hye's pledge to improve ties with Pyongyang.
