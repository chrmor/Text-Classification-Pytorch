The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), an Armenian terrorist organization, has threatened to attack Turkey in the event of a “direct or indirect violation of the security” of the Armenian community in Syria, according to panarmenian.net. ASALA released a statement saying they would launch "counter-measures" against Turkey if Ankara continued with its “conspirational and hostile policy" on Syria. Active from 1975 to 1986, ASALA claimed responsibility for about 200 attacks on Turkish diplomatic and non-diplomatic institutions and murdered 58 Turkish and non-Turkish people, 34 of whom were Turkish diplomats. ASALA was listed as a terrorist organization by the United States until the 1980s, but was taken off the list when the group disbanded.ASALA has been inactive since 1985.
