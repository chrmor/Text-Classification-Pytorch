Tibetan leaders ask public about Dalai Lama's role
   DHARMSALA – The exiled Tibetan community is being asked about what future role the Dalai Lama should play in government.
Spokesman Thupten Samphel says the parliament-in-exile will hold an open meeting in May to invite public opinion about shifting the Nobel Peace laureate's political power to elected leaders.
The Dalai Lama has insisted on resigning as political leader but will remain spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.
Samphel said Friday most lawmakers oppose fully erasing the 17th-century link between the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government, and so "would use public opinion ... to request the Dalai Lama to maintain some connection."
A parliamentary committee report on amending the constitution to make the changes is due April 11.
