U.S. warplanes, drones strike ISIS in Iraq, again
At this point, the United States has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS rampage. The USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region, and the FA/18s in Friday's initial strike came from the aircraft carrier, officials said.
There had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the Tigris River, with heavy fighting under way between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces, known as peshmerga. U.S. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad.
"France is ready to take its part," Hollande said in a statement from his office that called for the European Union "to take an active role very quickly" and put in place all the necessary assistance to respond to the crisis.
This hasn't always been the case "because of political issues," the KRG's official website notes. Yet the same site reported that Zebari said "it is now clear that the peshmerga and the Iraqi security forces are fighting together against a common enemy."
