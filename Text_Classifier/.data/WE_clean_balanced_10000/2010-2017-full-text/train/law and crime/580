Omagh bombing: Seamus Daly charged with 29 murders
A man accused of murdering 29 people in the 1998 Omagh bombing has been remanded in custody.
Seamus Daly, 43, from Culloville, County Monaghan, in the Republic of Ireland, faced 29 counts of murder and two charges linked to the explosion in Omagh, at Dungannon Magistrates' Court.
The Real IRA attack was the worst single atrocity of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
The victims included a woman who was pregnant with twins.
It happened just four months after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed.
Andy Martin, BBC Ireland correspondent, said there was a light security presence outside the court as Seamus Daly was led into the dock.
Mr Daly also faced two charges related to an attempted bomb attack in Lisburn, County Antrim, that took place in the same year as the Omagh bomb.
Bail was refused because of police concerns that he may flee the jurisdiction.
Seamus Daly has been connected to the bombing of Omagh before. Fourteen years ago the BBC's Panorama programme named him as a suspect in the case, and a civil action brought by the relatives of some of the victims found him and three others liable for the attack, and ordered them to pay more than Â£1.5m damages.
He has also previously pleaded guilty in the Republic of Ireland to membership of the IRA.
He was remanded in custody to appear again in May.
No-one has ever been convicted of carrying out the Omagh bombing.
Mr Daly has always denied any involvement.
