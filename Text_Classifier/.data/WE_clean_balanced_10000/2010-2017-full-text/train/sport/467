2014 AFL grand final: Sydney v Hawthorn at the MCG as it happened
A rampant Hawthorn handed the Sydney Swans a 63-point belting en route to a 12th AFL flag in the grand final at the MCG on Saturday afternoon.
Despite their favouritism, the Swans wilted under enormous Hawks pressure as Hawthorn triumphed 21.11(137) to 11.8 (74).
Hawthorn kicked five goals in the opening quarter and carried that momentum into the next stanza, booting another six to Sydney's three goals to establish a 42-point lead at the long break.
The lead kept climbing as the Hawks stretched the margin to 54 points after three periods, before sealing the most comfortable of wins, booting home five more in an emphatic win.
