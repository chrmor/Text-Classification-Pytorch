Venezuela: allies of Hugo Chavez sweep to victory in state elections
The ruling party won at least 19 of 23 states, according to preliminary results. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles held on for a re-election win in Miranda state, one of three opposition candidates declared winners.
Mr Capriles lost to Mr Chavez in the country's October election, and his re-election on Sunday will allow him to cement his position as Venezuela's dominant opposition leader, even as other opposition candidates floundered. But the loss of ground by the opposition also raises tough questions for government adversaries as they prepare for the possibility of new presidential elections should Mr Chavez fail to recover from his illness.
Going into the vote, the opposition had held the governorships in eight states, and it lost in five of those states according to the results announced by National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena.
Jorge Rodriguez, campaign manager for the pro-Chavez camp, hailed the victory saying it represented "the map painted red" - the colour of Chavez's socialist party.
"It really does underscore the fact that Chavismo really can survive, at least at the regional level, without Chavez," said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Latin American studies professor at Pomona College in Claremont, California.
"The reality is that the Chavistas today proved that their movement is institutionalized enough to sustain itself and to win statehouses in almost 90 percent of Venezuela."
The vote was the first time in Mr Chavez's nearly 14-year-old presidency that he has been unable to actively campaign. He hasn't spoken publicly since undergoing cancer surgery on Tuesday in Cuba.
The strong showing by pro-Chavez candidates could help them deepen his socialist policies, including a drive to fortify grass-roots citizen councils that are directly funded by the central government.
