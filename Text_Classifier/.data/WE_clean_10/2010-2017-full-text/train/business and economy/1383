Russia lifts 16-year ban on British beef and lamb imports
British farmers have been stopped from exporting to Russia following the 1996 BSE outbreak in the UK, despite it being lifted worldwide in 2006.
However the ban has now been lifted, in a welcome boost for Britain’s livestock farmers.
The Government said that official confirmation of the decision was expected to be issued by Moscow shortly
A worldwide ban on British live cattle, meat and products was lifted by the EU in 2006. However, Russia kept the ban in place amid fears over the threat of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
The continuing ban had been a point of tension between the UK and Russia. Prime Minister David Cameron raised the issue during a visit to Russia last year.
Last night Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “British food is recognised around the world for using quality ingredients, for rigorous production standards, and for reliable traceability.
“This deal is further evidence of international confidence in what British producers have to offer.Our food exports are booming, recently topping £10bn a year, and this government is doing all it can to open up markets abroad.”
Last year exports of British food and drink rose by nine per cent to £18.2billion.
