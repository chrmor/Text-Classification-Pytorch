Lamar Odom reportedly released from Las Vegas hospital
Former NBA player Lamar Odom has been released from a Las Vegas hospital and is being transported to another hospital closer to his Los Angeles-area home,  E! Online reported Monday
E! reported that doctors wanted to be sure Odom was stable enough to be moved. Odom, who played 14 seasons in the NBA — 12 years between the Clippers and Lakers — collapsed last week while at a Nevada brothel following a suspected binge of alcohol and drugs over the course of four days. He spent the next couple of days in a drug-induced coma and the worst was feared.

While still unable to stand on his own, Odom steadily improved over the weekend. He is still on dialysis because of failing kidneys, but passed a swallowing test and is breathing on his own. There may still be some cognitive issues, but he is able to communicate using hand signals, according to E!.
Once at the hospital in Southern California, the 35-year-old will continue to receive treatment and will require "a lot of rehab" to regain full function of his arms and legs. © Evan Agostini/AP Photo Lamar Odom
