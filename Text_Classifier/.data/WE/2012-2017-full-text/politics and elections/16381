Anti-Islam rallies in European cities
Protesters rallied against Islam and immigration in several European cities Saturday, sometimes clashing with police or counterdemonstrators amid growing tensions over the massive influx of asylum-seekers to the continent.
Riot police clashed with demonstrators in Amsterdam as supporters of the anti-Islam group PEGIDA tried to hold their first protest meeting in the Dutch capital. In Dresden, Germany, up to 8,000 people took part in a PEGIDA rally. Up to 3,500 people took part in a counterdemonstration.
In the northern French city of Calais, police dispersed a rowdy anti-migrant protest with tear gas after clashes with protesters and detained several far-right demonstrators.
