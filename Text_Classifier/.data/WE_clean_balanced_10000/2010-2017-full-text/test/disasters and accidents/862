2 dead, damage in Mexico after Hurricane Katia strikes
Sept. 9 (UPI) -- At least two people were killed after Hurricane Katia crashed into the southern Mexican coast late Friday and early Saturday as a Category 1 storm, authorities said.
Katia, which had been swirling in the Gulf of Mexico for days, made landfall north of Tecolutla, the National Hurricane Center said -- bringing strong winds and heavy rain.
Two people were reported dead in a mudslide from the storm's effects, though the toll could rise.
After arriving in Mexico -- as all hurricanes do when they hit land -- Katia quickly weakened with winds of about 35 mph.
Heavy damage was reported from the storm, as many structures on Mexico's coastal areas are not built to withstand severe weather.
Katia came at a time Mexico was already dealing with a major disaster. A 8.1-magnitude earthquake rocked the southern cost area late Thursday. More than 60 people were killed, at last count.
