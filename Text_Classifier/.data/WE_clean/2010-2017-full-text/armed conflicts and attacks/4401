Travel advisory out; DFA allocates funds for Pinoys in Egypt
MANILA, Philippines - The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is setting aside a P25-million standby fund for Filipinos in Egypt, in case there is a need for them to be transferred to safer places.
In a press release, the DFA said an inter-agency Crisis Management Committee also decided to issue a travel advisory to Egypt which advises Filipinos to cancel non-essential or non-urgent travels until the situation there stabilizes.
The Crisis Management Committee was convened in line with the instructions of President Benigno S. Aquino III to the DFA, DOLE and other concerned agencies to closely monitor the ongoing crisis in Egypt and to ensure the safety of Filipino community members.
Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto G. Romulo also directed Special Assistant Enrico Fos of the DFA-Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs (DFA-OUMWA) to depart for Egypt Monday to aid the Embassy in the implementation of contingency measures it has put in place for the Filipino community.
Consul General Ezzedin Tago, an Arabic-speaking career foreign service officer, has been likewise ordered to proceed to Cairo from his current station in Riyadh.Â 
Special Envoy Roy Cimatu will also proceed to Egypt after the conclusion of his mission in another country in the region.
