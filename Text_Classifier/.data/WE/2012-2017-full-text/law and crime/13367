Google joins other major retailers in banning Confederate flag goods
Google Inc has become the latest online retailer to pull all products bearing the controversial Confederate flag from sale in the wake of last week's racially-motivated massacre at a historic black church in South Carolina.
Amazon, eBay, Wal-Mart and Sears have already announced their decision to ban sales of merchandise displaying the image of the flag, which many see as representing racism and slavery.
