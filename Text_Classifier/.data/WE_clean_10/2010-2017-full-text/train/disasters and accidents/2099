Plane collides with drone at Heathrow, lands safely
London: A passenger aircraft approaching to land at London's Heathrow Airport may have collided with a drone, but landed safely.
British police have issued warnings in the past about the danger of the public use of remotely controlled drones near airports and other sensitive sites.
The pilot of the flight from Geneva, carrying 132 passengers and five crew, reported an object hitting the front of the Airbus A320. A British Airways spokesman said it had not been damaged.
Although the aircraft landed intact and was later cleared for its next flight, it has renewed calls for more to be done to curb drone use amid a quadrupling of near-misses involving drones and aircraft in the UK in recent months.
