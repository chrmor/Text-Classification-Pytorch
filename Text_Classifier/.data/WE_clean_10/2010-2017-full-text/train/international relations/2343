Turkey calls on Israel to sack Avigdor Lieberman
In an interview on al-Jazeera television, Recept Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, sought to present Mr Lieberman as an out-of-control maverick who had damaged Israel's international standing.
Reflecting deep anger in Ankara over a series of attacks that Mr Lieberman has directed at Turkey in recent weeks, the prime minister suggested that there was little hope of ending the diplomatic crisis with Israel while the foreign minister remained in office.
"Lieberman is Israel's chief problem and the Israelis should get rid of them," the prime minister said. "This is their problem not ours. If Israel doesn't fire him, their problems will get worse."
Mr Lieberman, who heads the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party in Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, offended sensibilities in Ankara last week by suggesting that Turkey was on the verge of succumbing to an Islamist-style revolution of the type that overthrew the Shah in Iran in 1979.
His comments were deeply embarrassing for Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who had invested considerable time over the past weeks trying to improve relations with Turkey, arguably Israel's most powerful Muslim ally.
Already strained by Israel's military campaign in Gaza at the end of 2008, relations were plunged into crisis when the Israeli navy killed nine Turkish activists during a botched operation to intercept an aid flotilla trying to reach the territory last year.
But after Turkey offered assistance to combat forest fires that killed over 40 people in Israel last month, Mr Netanyahu sensed an opportunity for reconciliation â€“ only to find that his foreign minister thought otherwise.
Mr Lieberman's intervention drew widespread domestic criticism, with editorials in right and left-wing newspapers calling for him to be sacked.
