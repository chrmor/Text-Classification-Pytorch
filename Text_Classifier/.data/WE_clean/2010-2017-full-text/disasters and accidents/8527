Nine dead as NY cops Irene's fury
Hurricane Irene has torn into New York, hammering Manhattan's skyscrapers with fierce winds and threatening to flood the financial district after killing at least nine people along the US east coast.
The first hurricane to hit the Big Apple for a generation swept in overnight local time, accompanied by lightning, reports of tornados and deafening rainfall.
Wind strength grew steadily and was forecast to cross the 80km/h mark before dawn, then up to a peak of 130km/h.
The city resembled a ghost town after 370,000 people were told to evacuate flood-prone areas, including near Wall Street and at Coney Island, and mass transport was shut down.
