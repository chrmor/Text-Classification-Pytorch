3D Express Coach to be put into trial in Beijing  CCTV News
The invention that can help solve the traffic jam problem in Beijing will soon be put into trial operation. It is a bus which will allow passengers to sit in its upper deck and will allow cars to pass through its ground floor. 3-D buses and cars use their own space and do not interfere with each other so the city traffic will become unprecedentedly unhindered. This sounds like a fairy tale, but the reporter did confirm after several visits that the 3-D fast bus has indeed been invented, and residents in Beijing will soon have chance to travel by this new type of bus.
According to a survey report recently released by the Beijing Peopleâ€™s Political Consultative Conference, the city is now suffering from even more severe traffic jams. The daily average time stuck in traffic jams has increased from three and a half hours in 2008 to the current five hours. However, the 3-D express buses, which will be put into trial operation in Mentougou District in late 2010, are expected to solve the problem of severe traffic jams in Beijing. The upper deck of the bus can carry passengers, while the ground floor is empty and can allows cars to pass through. Overall, the 3-D bus combines the features of subways and the bus rapid transit (BRT).
