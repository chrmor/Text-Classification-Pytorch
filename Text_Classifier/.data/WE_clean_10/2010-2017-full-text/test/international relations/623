Suspicion of Espionage at Iceland’s Parliament
Employees of the Icelandic parliament, Althingi, called the police to report a computer found in an empty room in the parliamentary building in February last year. The computer is believed to have been part of an espionage mission, as confirmed by Althingi’s office manager Helgi Bernódusson yesterday.
“All identifiers had been wiped off the computer, all numbers and such, so it couldn’t be traced back to the owner. It was a very suspicious computer but we just couldn’t figure it out and neither could the police,” he told Morgunbladid.
They suspected that the computer had been placed there to break into the computers of MPs and Althingi’s computer system, download information and send it to a different computer, possibly by Wikileaks hackers.
It appeared as if professionals had placed the computer and programmed it, which further supported theories of espionage, and when the computer was disconnected a program automatically started which deleted all data on the hard drive.
Althingi’s security system has been reviewed and improved since the incident.
