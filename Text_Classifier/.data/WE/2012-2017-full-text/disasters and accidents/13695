Joburg train crash: Number of casualties continues to rise
Johannesburg - The number of those injured in a train crash near the Booysens station in Johannesburg on Friday night has risen to 250, paramedics said.
"At this point in time, a total of 250 commuters have been attended to at the scene and have been transported to various hospitals by various services," Netcare 911 spokesperson Santi Steinmann said.
"There are currently still patients at the scene, so the number might even increased to approximately 300."
She said injuries ranged from minor to serious and people had been transported to various hospitals for treatment.
Earlier, paramedics said around 150 people had been injured.
No deaths have been reported.
ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said unconfirmed reports indicated that two trains had collided, causing one to partially overturn.
But Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said it was too early to say what had caused the accident.
The priority was getting the injured treated.
Other train stations had been affected and Metrorail was providing alternative transport to get commuters to their destinations, she said.
The accident happened around 18:00 during peak time.
