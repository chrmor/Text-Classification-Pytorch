Belarus, U.S. 'Ready' To Discuss Return Of Ambassadors
MINSK -- The top U.S. diplomat in Belarus, Scott Rauland, and Belarusian Foreign Minister Uladzimer Makey said on April 25 that their countries are ready to discuss the possible return of their ambassadors.
Makey told reporters in Minsk that "there is readiness from both sides for a full normalization of our relations."
He said the United States and Belarus "must not look at each other through guns' crosshairs, but must talk, have an open dialogue."
Rauland expressed hope that the return of the ambassadors would be a theme for discussions with the Belarusian Foreign Ministry later in 2016.
Belarus recalled its ambassador from Washington in 2008 and insisted that the U.S. ambassador must leave Minsk.
That move came after the U.S. imposed sanctions against Belarusian oil giant Belneftekhim following tensions between Minsk and the West.
