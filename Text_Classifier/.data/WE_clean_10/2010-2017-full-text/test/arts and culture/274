The 19-year-old secretly accepted an MBE shortly before his death on May 14 after winning the hearts of the nation with his work for the Teenage Cancer Trust.
His honour is backdated to the day of his death after a fund-raising drive which resulted in a huge boost to the charity’s donations and raised £4million.
The teenager was joined in the latest round of honours by names from the world of entertainment, sport and business – as well as ordinary members of the public.
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie receives an honorary Damehood for her campaign to end sexual violence in conflict, Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis is given a knighthood, while Damian Lewis, star of television series Homeland, gets an OBE.
Actress Dame Maggie Smith, 79, is made a Companion of Honour, a CBE goes to BBC Radio 4 Gardeners’ Question Time’s Roy Lancaster, and OBEs go to writer Hunter Davies, 78, and Mercury Prize-winning musician Talvin Singh, 43.
Laurie Johnson, 87, the composer behind the theme music for The Avengers and The Professionals, receives an MBE.
Folk musician Eliza Carthy, 38, daughter of Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, also receives an MBE.
Yesterday, Stephen Sutton’s mother Jane said that despite his reluctance to be recognised for his charity work, he acknowledged that to receive an MBE was “awesome”.
The teenager, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer aged 15, stayed positive throughout his illness, always smiling and giving his trademark “thumbs up”.
Mrs Sutton said she was “truly delighted and immensely proud” that he had been recognised in the honours.
She said: “Shortly before Stephen passed away on May 14 he received a letter from the Cabinet Office asking if he was agreeable to accepting an MBE in recognition of his fundraising and services to the Teenage Cancer Trust.
“He thought it was an incredible honour to have been nominated and it definitely got the ‘thumbs up’.”
