Squash: Egypt’s Ashour wins El-Gouna open after beating compatriot Elshorbagy
Egypt’s Ramy Ashour clinched the El-Gouna International Open title on Friday after beating compatriot Mohamed Elshorbagy 3-1 on Friday.
Ashour, the world number four, looked to be cruising to victory when he won the first two games 11-7 and 12-10.
World number three Elshorbagy kept his hopes alive after winning the third game 11-8, only for Ashour to settle the tie in his favour with a 11-8 victory in the fourth game.
It is Ashour’s first PSA World Series title since he claimed the 2013 British Open.
“I’ve never felt better,” Ashour was quoted as saying by the PSA official website after the game.
“I’m overwhelmed to win the title and I’m very happy with my performance today – I thought it was a great match.”
Ashour did not drop a single game en route to the final, having returned to his best after recovering from an injury-plagued period.
