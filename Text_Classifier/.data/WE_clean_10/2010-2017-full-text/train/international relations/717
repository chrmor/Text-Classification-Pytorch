After IDF raid, aid makes its way to Gaza
The equipment found on the ships seized early Monday by the Israel Defense Forces while making their way to the Gaza Strip is being unloaded at the Ashdod Port since Monday night.
"Most of the equipment was scattered in the ships' storerooms and was not packed in an organized manner," said the port's CEO, Shuki Sagis.
"We began unloading in the night," Sagis explained. "We see cargo which was arranged and repacked in order to be led to Gaza, mostly humanitarian cargo, food and toys."
He added that some unusual items were also found, but refused to elaborate.
The cargo has yet to be weighed, and according to Sagis, in an ordinary situation the ship would not have been accepted at the port as most of its content was unpacked and unorganized.
"Nonetheless, we took in those ships and are engaging in Sisyphean labor," he said.
According to the port's CEO, after the goods were packed, "product after product," they were being led to the Gaza Strip.
"So far we have sent dozens of trucks with cargo," he said. Dudi Gofer, head of the Defense Ministry's international transportation unit, said that some 20 trucks had left for Gaza.
According to Gofer, "The equipment arrived without any international regulations. We are now unloading it, identifying it and performing an x-ray and dog examination. We are in contact with the authorities to receive the equipment."
Colonel Moshe Levy, head of the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Office, said that "there was no need for this cargo. The same goods have been sent into Gaza over the past year on a regular basis. There were more than 100 electric scooters, and tons of medical equipment. This proves that the entire sail was propagandist and provocative and had nothing to do with aid."
