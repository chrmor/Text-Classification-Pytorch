Israel should join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in order for a nuclear-free Middle East to take shape, Iran's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ali Asghar Soltanieh said.
Israel should join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in order for a nuclear-free Middle East to take shape, Iran's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ali Asghar Soltanieh said.
“The Zionist regime’s joining the NPT is Iran's condition to attend the Middle East Nuclear Weapon Free Zone conference,” Soltanieh said, adding that Iran believes the region should be cleared of any nuclear weapons.
The Iranian envoy called on world countries to exert pressure on Israel to sign the treaty.
Israel, believed to have between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads, has ignored international calls to join the treaty.
