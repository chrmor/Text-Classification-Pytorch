Indonesian ferry sinks, 11 dead
At least 11 people have died and more than 30 were missing after an Indonesian passenger boat was hit by high waves and sank, rescue officials said.
Rescuers braved storms and rough seas to search for survivors, drafting in local fishermen to help scour the waters near Flores island in the east of the country.
"We have found 11 dead bodies and still look for about 32 people that went missing," National Search and Rescue Agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso told AFP on Monday.
The boat set sail carrying about 60 passengers at 7.30 am (0930 AEST) and capsized two hours later in East Nusa Tenggara province, he said.
Local police chief Abdul Rahma Aba said that the inter-island vessel was struck by high waves which caused panic among passengers before it capsized about two miles from shore.
Some 17 passengers were found alive, and four vessels from the local search and rescue agency and sea police unit have been deployed with up to 70 rescuers, Prakoso said.
