Hugo weaves its magic with Archibald prize judges
Sydney-based artist Del Kathryn Barton has won the 2013 Archibald prize for her portrait of actor Hugo Weaving.
Ms Barton beat 38 other finalists to win the prestigious $75,000 annual portrait prize.
The textured portrait depicts Weaving holding a wild cat that Barton says demonstrates facets of the actor's personality.
Ms Barton says the cat came up during a conversation about what is close to Weavings' heart.
"When he was talking about animals that he might potentially identify with there was the idea of the wildcat or the leopard or the wolf," she said.
"So in the end it was a kind of generic wildcat to represent other facets of his personality."
Barton says she admires Weaving and that he was very patient.
This is Barton's fourth time entering the Archibald Prize, which she won in 2008 with a portrait of herself with her two children.
All up, there were 868 Archibald entries this year.
Matthew Lynn won this year's Packing Room prize for his portrait of Canadian-born author Tara Moss.
The Packing Room prize has never gone to the same artwork as the judges' decision in the main Archibald contest.
An exhibition of the portraits begins on Saturday and continues until the beginning of June.
Visitors to the exhibition will vote on the People's Choice award which will be announced on May 16.
