Greenland approves same-sex marriage
KNR reported that Greenland’s proposal to allow same-sex marriage was first brought up in 2010 but because the issue was seen as something to be decided by the Kingdom of Denmark, the plans were put on the back burner until Denmark passed its same-sex marriage legislation in June 2012. The plans were then further delayed by former Greenlandic PM Aleqa Hammond’s corruption scandal and a subsequent snap election  that was won by the social democratic Siumut in a nail-biter .
