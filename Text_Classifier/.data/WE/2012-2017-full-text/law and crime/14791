IDF arrests senior Hamas figure Hassan Yousef in West Bank
Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a senior Hamas official based in the West Bank, was arrested by the IDF before dawn on Tuesday. Israeli authorities said the arrest was made after determining that a number of recent statements made by Yousef, one of the organization's founders, constituted incitement to commit acts of violence. Yousef was taken in for questioning following his detainment.
