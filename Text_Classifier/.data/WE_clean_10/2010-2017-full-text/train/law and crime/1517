Former WA premier to face new trial
Former West Australian premier Brian Burke is set to face a new corruption trial after a previous acquittal was overturned.
In the Court of Appeal in Perth on Wednesday, the Supreme Court acquittals of Mr Burke, his business partner and former Labor cabinet colleague Julian Grill and former public servant Nathan Hondros, were set aside and a new trial was ordered.
In May last year Justice Michael Murray found there was no evidence Mr Burke and Mr Grill procured Mr Hondros to disclose official documents or tried to sneak through changes to pearl hatchery policy to benefit a client.
Justice Murray found the prosecution failed to provide enough evidence to prove the charges against the two former lobbyists and Mr Hondros, who was the chief of staff to the fisheries minister.
The charges were laid after a 2006 investigation by WA's Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) which used phone taps to listen in to conversations of the three men.
WA prosecutors appealed Justice Murray's decision to dismiss the charges and on Wednesday three appeal court judges ruled in their favour and ordered a new trial.
