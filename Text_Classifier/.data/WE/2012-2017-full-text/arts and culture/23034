Big Ben bell sounds for last time for 4 years
LONDON — Big Ben's iconic bell sounded the hour for the last time Monday before it went silent for nearly four years of repair work.
After 12 deep bongs at noon (7 a.m. ET), the bell began its longest period of silence since it first rang out in 1859 from its famous perch over the British Parliament.
A $38 million renovation will run until 2021, though the bell will be heard on special occasions such as New Year’s Eve.

Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock in the Elizabeth Tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. It is one of London's best-known sounds and is popular with visitors. Lawmakers, tourists and passersby assembled in Parliament Square on Monday to hear the bell's final chimes before the conservation work.
However, the decision to silence the bell is not without controversy. Some British parliamentarians, including Prime Minister Theresa May who said "it cannot be right" for the bell not to chime for four years, object to the cost and timescale of the renovations. A parliamentary committee has vowed to review the repair plan.
