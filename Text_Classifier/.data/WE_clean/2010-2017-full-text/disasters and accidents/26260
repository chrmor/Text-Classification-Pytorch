3 more people dead as floods wreak havoc in Nairobi
Police said the incident occurred on Lusaka Road when the vehicle they were travelling in was submerged in floods and overturned.
Nairobi Police chief Japheth Koome said another person was also swept away in South C.
“In total we lost three people all taken away by floods last night in the two incidents,” he said on telephone. Four others had been killed earlier Friday afternoon when a wall collapsed on them along Lenana Road, near the Department of Defence (DoD) headquarters.
Koome said the four were sheltering when the wall went down.
The Kenya Red Cross said it was still undertaking assessment to ascertain the full extent of the flood casualty in Nairobi.
Transport was paralysed for hours on Friday night as motorists waded through the raging floods on various roads, with many vehicles getting stuck.
The Kenya Red Cross said estates and slums along Nairobi and Ngong Rivers were worst affected. They include Hazina, Fuata Nyayo, Land Mawe, Industrial Area, South C.
