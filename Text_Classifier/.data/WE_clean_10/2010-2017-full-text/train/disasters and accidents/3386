Arunachal CM Dorjee Khandu's chopper debris sighted, relative identifies body; others charred
The wreckage of the ill-fated chopper that carried Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Dorjee Khandu, 56, has been finally found after nearly 100 hours of it going down, confirming the country's worst fears.
He is the second chief minister of the country to have been killed in a helicopter crash.
Confirming this, B K Handique, Union Minister for Development of Northeast, said at Itanagar that while a search party headed by a local panchayat leader called Thupten was the first to have sighted the wreckage and the bodies, a family member later reached the spot � about two hours by foot � to identify the chief minister's body.
The spot where the wreckage of the Pawan Hans chopper was found on Wednesday morning is a remote location about 10 kilometres from Jang, which is 30 kilometres south-east of Tawang, accessible only after a two-hour footmarch from the Jang waterfalls. It is northeast of the 14,000-feet Sela range, and the crash site is said to be at an elevation of about 11,000 feet.
The single-engine, five-seater Eurocopter-made Pawan Hans chopper had lost contact with ground control 20 minutes after it took off from Tawang at 9:50 am on April 30 for Itanagar. The other four people on board apart from the chief minister were Captain J S Babbar and Captain K S Malick, Khandu's security officer Yeshi Choddak and Yeshi Lamu, a sister of Tawang legislator Tsewang Dhondup.
"The body of Khandu has been identified by the local panchayat leader and a family member, while the other four have been charred beyond recognition. An official confirmation can be made only when the bodies are brought out and the necessary formalities are completed," Handique said.
While the chopper went missing on Saturday morning, a radar scanning by two Sukhoi aircrafts of the IAF and satellite images by an ISRO satellite could not pinpointed any wreckage. Aerial search operations by IAF choppers based at Tawang, Tezpur and Guwahati on the other hand were seriously hampered with the weather turning bad since Sunday morning.
