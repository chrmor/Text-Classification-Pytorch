Somali car bomb kills six near presidential palace
A car bomb has exploded at the gate of Somalia's presidential palace in the capital Mogadishu killing at least six people, witnesses say.
A conference debating the nature of Somalia's election in 2016 had just ended in the compound.
Presidential guards and a Turkish national are believed to be among the dead, as most delegates had left.
It is not yet known who carried out the attack but the Islamist group al-Shabab has targeted the palace before.
Al-Shabab lost control of Mogadishu in 2011, but often carries out attacks in the city.
The presidential palace is the seat of government and many top government officials live and work there.
