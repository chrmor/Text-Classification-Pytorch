MOSCOW, November 24 (RIA Novosti) – Miss Czech Republic Tereza Fajksova has won the Miss Earth 2012 beauty pageant, which was held in Manila, Philippines, on Saturday.
Miss Philippines Stephany Stefanowitz was crowned as Miss Earth Air, Miss Venezuela Osmariel Villalobos as Miss Earth Water and Miss Brazil Camila Brant as Miss Earth Fire, The Times of India reported.
The new Miss Earth titleholder, Fajksova, 23, is the third European contestant to be crowned Miss Earth. She received the crown from her predecessor, Miss Earth 2011 Olga Alava of Ecuador.
Russia's Miss Earth contestant, Natalya Pereverzeva, 24, who was among top 16 finalists, shocked the public by her controversial essay about Russia, in which she criticized corruption in the country.
“My Russia is a beggar. My Russia cannot help her elderly and orphans. From it, bleeding, like from a sinking ship, engineers, doctors, teachers are fleeing, because they have nothing to live on," the essay said.
The remarks set off a firestorm of criticism in the Internet, with most bloggers accusing her of being ‘unpatriotic’ and ‘weird.’
