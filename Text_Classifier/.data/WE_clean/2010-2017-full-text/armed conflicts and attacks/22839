Burkina Faso Military Puts Down Last Holdouts From Coup Attempt
Throughout the day, tanks and armored pickup trucks took up positions outside the palace and the barracks. Soldiers, armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, were stationed around the national radio and television stations and at the airport, which was closed.
The government ordered residents to stay away from the neighborhood around the palace, known as Ouaga 2000.
On Tuesday night, General Diendéré told Agence France-Presse in a telephone interview that he feared “many deaths and injuries” in the operation, but there was no official confirmation of any casualties. General Diendéré said he had left the base, but he would not disclose his whereabouts.
The transitional government announced the end of the coup in a statement.
“The coup elements of the former R.S.P. remained unbending in their will to define the Burkinabe people,” the transitional government said, using the French initials of the Presidential Security Regiment. “Using delaying tactics in the expectation of foreign reinforcements and in the hope of an eventually rallying of internal support, these coup elements, surrounded by a group of die-hards, have held the daily lives of millions of Burkinabe people. Faced with a situation that had become intolerable for our people, and determined to turn this dark page in our common history, our patriotic Defense and Security Forces carried out their responsibilities successfully.”
The R.S.P. was created in 1995 by President Blaise Compaoré, who was toppled by a mass uprising last October after 27 years in power. Mr. Compaoré has been living in exile in Morocco — he was scheduled to travel to Ivory Coast for medical treatment on Tuesday — but many of his associates and supporters remain active in political life.
