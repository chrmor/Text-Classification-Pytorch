China church ordains bishop over Vatican objection
China's government-backed Catholic church is ordaining a bishop who does not have the pope's approval, despite objections from the Vatican and comments by a key papal adviser that the move is "illegitimate" and "shameful." A man answering the telephone at the office of the Pingquan Church in northeastern Hebei province confirmed the ordination ceremony for the Rev. Guo Jincai was nearing its close Saturday morning. The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association's vice chairman, Liu Bainian, said in a phone interview Friday that Guo's ordination would go forward. China's first ordination without papal approval in almost five years has threatened to hurt the officially atheist country's already shaky relations with the Vatican.
