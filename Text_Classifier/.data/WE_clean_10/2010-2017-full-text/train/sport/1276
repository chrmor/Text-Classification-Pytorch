Celtic linked with switch to England's League One
Celtic manager Neil Lennon has said his team could hold their own in the English top flight, amid reports the Scottish side are considering joining League One.
Celtic have long been linked with a move to English football but there has been a reluctance to let the Scottish side walk straight into the Premier League.
The Sunday People report that Celtic are now willing to drop down to League One and then fight their way up through the divisions. The radical plan is set to be put to Football League clubs this summer.
However, Lennon believes Celtic, who are 21 points ahead of Rangers and Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League, could operate in the English top flight.
Lennon pointed to the likes of Scotland winger James Forrest and Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama as players who would thrive in the Premier League.
Lennon told Sunday newspapers: "People keep saying the EPL is so far ahead - and in some respects it is. But Celtic could play there and do all right.
"I don't know where we would finish but I don't think we would get relegated.
"But it is not just about quality - with our prestige, support, tradition and history, I think Celtic would add something extra to England's top flight."
