Kenyan authorities say the death toll from Friday's collapsed eight-story residential building in Nairobi has risen to 20, with 73 people missing. Rescuers continue searching for survivors. The building had been declared unfit for human habitation by the country's National Construction Authority, but remained standing. Note: the building was originally reported as six stories; flooding had sunk the ground and first floors.
