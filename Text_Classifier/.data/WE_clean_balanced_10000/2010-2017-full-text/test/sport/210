Liverpool 1-1 Man City (City win 3-1 on pens): Willy Caballero helps Manuel Pellegrini's men to Capital One Cup glory
Willy Caballero was Manchester City's shoot-out hero as Manuel Pellegrini signed off with a trophy.
Caballero, given a run-out as City's specialist cup keeper in preference to England No.1 Joe Hart, saved three penalties in the lottery to leave Liverpool broken-hearted.
Liverpool's last three major trophies had been won on penalty shoot-outs, and they were taken to the spot-kicks lottery by Carlisle and Stoke on the road to Wembley, so it was somehow inevitable that Jurgen Klopp's first tilt at silverware in English football should boil down to a shoot-out.
As if Liverpool had not been disrupted by injuries enough already this season, they lost Mamadou Sakho after a clash of heads with his own team-mate Emre Can.
Sakho wanted to carry on, but manager Jurgen Klopp pulled rank – and the French defender's tantrums spoke volumes for his disagreement with the decision.
Moments earlier, Sergio Aguero had left Sakho on his backside in the only close call at either end in the first 45 minutes, Simon Mignolet tipping the Argentine striker's effort on to the foot of a post.
But three minutes after the restart, City went in front when Mignolet blundered, Fernandinho smuggling an angled cross-shot beneath the Belgian keeper who, frankly, should have done better.
Raheem Sterling, booed throughout, squandered two yawning chances to settle all arguments and he was made to pay nine minutes from time.
Sub Adam Lallana arrived at the far post to drive his shot against the woodwork from a tight angle, but Philippe Coutinho buried the rebound like Ronnie O'Sullivan pocketing a 146 break.
Mignolet made a crucial intervention in extra time, sticking out a hand to thwart Aguero before Willy Caballero's reflexes denied Liverpool sub Divock Origi from close range at the other end.
While England No.1 Joe Hart sat out a major showpiece to allow his understudy Willy Caballero a trot, Liverpool were haunted by a familiar failing.
Surely a goalkeeper is top of Jurgen Klopp's wish-list this summer – because neither Simon Mignolet nor Adam Bogdan has come up to scratch.
Mignolet did the hard part, producing a brilliant fingertip save to divert Sergio Aguero's shot on to the post, and there were a couple of brave interventions later – but he allowed Fernandinho's shot to sneak under his body.
On the money markets, the pound in your pocket has been taking a hammering amid the uncertainty over Britain staying in the European Union.
But the £ is not the only Sterling struggling to keep its value. Raheem Sterling has only lived up to his £49 million price tag in fits and starts for Manchester City, and Liverpool fans were never going to forgive his defection to the Etihad on the big stage.
Noisy refrains about Sterling's avarice and parentage reverberated around the west end of Wembley before he shovelled two glorious chances wide when he should have made it 2-0.
Mamadou Sakho's reluctant withdrawal after 25 minutes brought Liverpool sub Kolo Toure into the fray – and into a duel against his brother Yaya.
It was the first time anyone could remember brothers on opposite sides in a Wembley cup final, bringing the delicious prospect of Kolo's pre-match promise to “take out” Yaya if required.
Alberto Moreno's sense of adventure may give Liverpool an extra attacking dimension, but he was nowhere to be seen when City went in front.
Fernandinho had the freedom of Liverpool's left-back constituency when he galloped forward to break the deadlock.
Defensive cover is not an optional extra against Manchester City, it's a basic necessity.
In the days of the old twin towers, Liverpool fans used to refer to the national stadium as Anfield South because it was their second home.
Trips to Wembley have been less frequent, and less kind, this century – but emissaries from the Kop always lend a vibrant atmosphere to the place.
And in one respect they remain unrivalled among supporters across the land: In lean times – and there have been plenty of those in 26 years since Liverpool were champions – they have never turned on their own players.
Grasping American owners, yes, but never the team.
