Palaszczuk paves way for new Queensland Labor
Second generation Labor MP and new party leader Annastacia Palaszczuk has set herself two herculean tasks: rebuilding the battered Labor brand, and keeping the Liberal National Party in check.
Ms Palaszczuk was endorsed yesterday to preside over the handful of MPs left standing after Labor's thumping, reduced to just seven seats in the 89-seat parliament.
With so few colleagues, the responsibility of 20 or so portfolios and keeping the government to account will be like "climbing Mount Everest", she said.
Ms Palaszczuk used her first speech as Opposition Leader to say her party was small but very spirited.
