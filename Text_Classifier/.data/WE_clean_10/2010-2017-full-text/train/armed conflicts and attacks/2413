CIA to show bin Laden photos to House, Senate panels
CNN is reporting that the CIA will show photos of the corpse of Osama bin Laden to members of congressional military and intelligence committees.
Members of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees, along with their House counterparts,will be shown the photos at CIA headquarters at a time to be decided, a U.S. official told CNN.
President Obama decided last week that he would not publicly release the "very graphic photos" of the al-Qaeda leader after he was shot in the head and killed during the raid on his Pakistan compound.
