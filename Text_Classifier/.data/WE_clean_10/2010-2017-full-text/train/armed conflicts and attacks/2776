News: NATO attack helicopters increase pressure on Qadhafi regime , 04-Jun.-2011
NAPLES – Attack helicopters under NATO command were used for the first time on 4 Jun 2011 in military operations over Libya as part of Operation Unified Protector.
“This successful engagement demonstrates the unique capabilities brought to bear by attack helicopters,” said Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard, Commander of Operation Unified Protector. “We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed, using the same precision as we do in all of our missions.”
The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Qadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas.
NATO forces are constantly reviewing their operations and use of available assets, including attack helicopters, to best maintain the momentum and increase the pressure on pro-Qadhafi forces.
NATO’s operation is being conducted under the United Nations Security Resolution 1973, which calls for an immediate end to all attacks against civilians and authorized all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya.
