Israel Agrees to Pause in Assault on Gaza as Cease-Fire Deal Is Pursued
Mr. Kerry has proposed a two-stage plan to halt the fighting — a weeklong truce, during which negotiations would start on the principal economic, political and security concerns about Gaza.
One senior Israeli official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the fragile diplomacy, said that a crucial element for Israel was whether a temporary cease-fire would allow it to continue its operations against the tunnel network, which Hamas militants have used to infiltrate Israeli territory. Military officials say that most of the tunnels have been located but that destroying them is a lengthy and complicated process.
Amid the cease-fire efforts, violence spread across the West Bank as enraged Palestinians protested Israel’s military assault in Gaza. The protests came on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and Palestinians called it a day of rage.
Weeks of simmering tensions and clashes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have increased talk among Israelis and Palestinians alike about the specter of a third Palestinian intifada, or uprising.
But many said that such uprisings, by their nature, could not be planned or predicted.
“The intifada does not start by a decision and end by a decision,” said Othman Abu Gharbiya, a member of the Fatah central committee, a decision-making body of the mainstream party that dominates the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Still, he said, “no doubt we are passing through a dangerous time.”
Three Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces in Beit Ommar, near Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to local activists, as a demonstration erupted into a violent confrontation. They identified the three as Sultan Shuqdam, Abd al-Hamid Breigheth, and Hashem Abu Maria.
Mr. Maria, 45, was a staff member of Defense of Children International-Palestine, an advocacy group. Citing witnesses, the group said that clashes had erupted but that Mr. Abu Maria was not participating in the violence and was standing still when a bullet hit him.
Clashes between stone-throwing youths and Israeli security forces continued in Beit Ommar on Friday evening during funerals for the three men. Thousands of people were in the streets of the town, and the entrance was blocked by Israeli soldiers.
Another Palestinian man, known as a Fatah activist, was fatally shot in the nearby Al-Aroub refugee camp, hospital officials said. The Israeli military said only that a man had been shot when he tried to grab a soldier’s weapon during a riot there.
Two more Palestinians were fatally shot near Hawara, south of Nablus, according to a medical official at Rafadiyeh Hospital in Nablus. Palestinian news reports said that at least one of them was shot by a female Israeli settler but the Israeli authorities denied the reports.
A police spokesman said that an Israeli woman got out of her vehicle and fired warning shots in the air as about 200 Palestinians were blocking the road and hurling rocks.
Instead, Israeli border police officers in the area may have caused at least one of the deaths. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said that officers on patrol near Hawara clashed with hundreds of Palestinians who were throwing stones, firebombs and fireworks at them “at close range.”
One officer fired at a Palestinian because the officer felt he was “in a life-threatening situation,” Mr. Rosenfeld said.
The police said minor disturbances broke out in some East Jerusalem neighborhoods early in the afternoon, as 10,000 Muslims attended prayers in the Al Aksa Mosque compound. They said the disturbances resumed in East Jerusalem after dark.
Thousands attended the funeral of a Muhammad al-Araj, 17, who was killed on Thursday night during clashes with Israeli security forces after a mass march to the Qalandia checkpoint that separates Ramallah and Jerusalem. Muhammad’s father, Ziad al-Araj, 41, a plasterer from the nearby Qalandia refugee camp, said that after seeing the bodies of women and children killed in Gaza on television, his son had told him that he wanted to join the fighters there. “He wrote in his phone, ‘I hope to be a martyr,’ ” Mr. Araj said.
The imam at the Qalandia camp’s mosque assailed Israel in his Friday sermon, shouting in fury, “Kill me, cut me into pieces, drown me in blood, you will never live in my land, you will never live in my sky!”
In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces killed a member of Islamic Jihad’s military wing and two of his sons with an airstrike near Rafah. The group said that the airstrike killed Salah Abu Hassanein, 45, and his sons, ages 15 and 12, in the entrance to their home. Mr. Hassanein was a spokesman for the Al-Quds Brigades.
The military said that during one of the battles in Gaza, militants emerged from a tunnel and tried to capture a wounded soldier but that its forces foiled the attempt. And it said it had concluded that Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, who had been missing in Gaza since Sunday, was killed in battle. The military wing of Hamas claimed to be holding him captive, but did not offer evidence.
The military said in a statement that a special committee had considered all the religious, medical and other relevant issues and had classified Sergeant Shaul as “a soldier killed in action whose burial site is unknown.”
Sergeant Shaul was one of seven soldiers who entered the Gaza Strip early on Sunday in an armored personnel carrier that was stopped in the Shejaiya neighborhood of Gaza City and then was incinerated by an antitank missile. The remains of the other six soldiers were recovered.
Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to fire rockets into Israel on Friday. The Israeli military said two were intercepted over Tel Aviv by the country’s Iron Dome antimissile system.
