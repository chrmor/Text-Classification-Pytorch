Flood evacuation ordered in Walgett
An evacuation order has been issued for residents of a village near Walgett, as more than 5000 people remain isolated by floodwaters across northern NSW.
Power has been lost at the small indigenous community of Namoi Village near Walgett, sparking the NSW State Emergency Service (SES) to tell residents of the village to evacuate their homes by 7pm (AEDT) on Sunday.
"You can choose to go to friends or relatives," the SES said in a statement on Sunday.
"Alternatively, temporary accommodation can be arranged for you and other assistance provided."
Across the Walgett area, where 322 people were isolated, the river continued to rise and was predicted to peak at 13.5 metres on Monday, the SES said.
"It is expected that over the next 48 hours, floodwater from the Namoi River will reach the Castlereagh Highway."
