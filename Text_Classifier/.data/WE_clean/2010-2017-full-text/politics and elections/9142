Solomon Islands prime minister Danny Philip has resigned ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence.
The opposition was certain it had the numbers to bring down the government, claiming 31 of the nation's 49 MPs would be supporting the no confidence vote.
Mr Philip's replacement is expected to be named later today, after his letter of resignation is presented to the governor-general.
There are three potential candidates to replace Mr Philip.
They include finance minister Gordon Darcy Lilo and public service minister Rick Hou, who were both sacked by Mr Philip yesterday.
