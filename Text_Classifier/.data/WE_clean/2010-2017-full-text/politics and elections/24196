Pentagon blasts rhetoric like Trump's that 'bolsters the ISIL narrative'
The Pentagon is trying to avoid getting directly involved in the political drama over Donald Trump’s call to a ban Muslims from entering the United States, but a spokesman made clear on Tuesday the military considers anti-Muslim rhetoric a threat to national security.
“Without wading into politics, anything that tries to bolster the ISIL narrative that the United States is somehow at war with Islam is contrary to our values and contrary to our national security,” Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook told reporters.
“We are partnering right now with Muslim nations,” he said. “We have troops serving that follow the Muslim faith.”
He declined to specifically address Trump’s call for a ban.
On Monday, the Trump campaign issued a press release, saying the Republican presidential candidate was “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.” And Trump has pressed the issue forcefully since on the campaign trail and in a series of television interviews.
