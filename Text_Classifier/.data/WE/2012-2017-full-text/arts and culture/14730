Stephen Glass Repays Harper’s $10,000 for His Discredited Work
Stephen Glass, one of journalism’s most infamous fabulists, sent Harper’s Magazine a check for $10,000 this week as repayment for a discredited article he had published there in 1998, and said he planned to repay other publications that ran his fabricated work.
“I want to make right that part of my many transgressions,” he wrote in a letter to current and former magazine employees. “I recognize that repaying Harper’s will not remedy my wrongdoing, make us even, or undo what I did wrong. That said, I did not deserve the money that Harper’s paid me and it should be returned.”
Mr. Glass wrote that he had “a vague memory that the magazine paid me approximately $5,000 to $7,000,” and that he hoped $10,000 would “repay the magazine with interest.”
Reached by email on Friday, Mr. Glass said he also planned to repay other outlets — a total that, by some estimates, could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. He declined to comment further.
Mr. Glass was a rising star in journalism in the late 1990s, known for vivid features at The New Republic, where he was an associate editor, and other magazines. His work included an article in the February 1998 issue of Harper’s about his experiences becoming a phone-in psychic.
