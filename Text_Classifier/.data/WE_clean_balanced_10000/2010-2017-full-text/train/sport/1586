Video: Greece's goal against Ireland tonight set to melancholic music
Here’s José Holeba's goal that made the difference at the Aviva Stadium tonight as Greece beat Ireland 1-0 set to appropriate music.
Watch Greece’s beautiful build-up play as they waltz to through the Irish defence and Holebas turns John O’Shea with ease to get his shot away.
Though it’s set to soothing music there’s precious little comforting about watching this goal again for the Green Army.

If we were making a video with music showing this goal from the Irish perspective we would have used the fat-guy-tuba-music from Family Guy to encapsulate all the Irish grace shown in this defensive play from the Irish defence...exactly none.
