Carter Cautions US Ground Troops Would 'Americanize' ISIS Fight
"While we certainly have the capability to furnish a US component to such a ground force, we have not recommended this course of action for several reasons," Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). "In the near-term, it would be a significant undertaking that, realistically, we would embark upon largely by ourselves; and it would be ceding our comparative advantage of special forces, mobility, and firepower, instead fighting on the enemy's terms.Â In the medium-term, by seeming to Americanize the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, we could well turn those fighting ISIL or inclined to resist their rule into fighting us instead."
