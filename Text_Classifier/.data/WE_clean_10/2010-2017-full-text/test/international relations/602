North Korea planning terror attack, spy agency says
North Korea is currently planning a "terrorist attack" on South Korea according to the South's spy agency.  
A lawmaker, briefed by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), says leader Kim Jong Un himself gave the order to make preparations.
"North Korea's terrorist attack could be in the form of causing harms to anti-North Korean activists, North Korean defectors or government officials," said Saenuri Party member, Lee Chul-woo, when CNN contacted his office Thursday.  
Members of the ruling Saenuri Party held a closed-door meeting with the NIS, defense ministry and other ministries.
The NIS warning covered a large number of possible targets, including "subways, shopping malls, exhibition centers, power plants" as well as possible cyber attacks.
