Bombing in Baquba, Iraq, kills 30; ISIS claims responsibility
A suicide car bomb ripped through a busy outdoor market Monday night near the Iraqi city of Baquba, killing at least 30 people and wounding 40 others, police and health officials said.
In a statement posted on Twitter and re-tweeted by several of its supporters, ISIS said its members were behind the attack -- a claim that's hardly surprising, given the group's grisly record of terror in war-torn Iraq and neighboring Syria.
It was not immediately clear who carried out a roadside bombing that happened in the same general area about an hour later that killed four more people, according to local officials.
Both blasts were in predominantly Shiite Muslim areas. ISIS consists of Sunni Muslim extremists.
