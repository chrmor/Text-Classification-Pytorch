85 reported dead after fuel tank explosion in South Sudan
85 people are reported to have been killed in South Sudan after a fuel truck explosion.
Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said that a further 50 people were injured in the blast in Maridi in the country’s heavily rural Western Equatoria state when the truck veered off the road.
According to local officials, the truck was “full of petrol” which started to leak after the crash.
Locals began siphoning off fuel and someone is believed to have lit a cigarette, sparking an explosion.
Mr Ateny said the injured had been taken to local hospitals.
