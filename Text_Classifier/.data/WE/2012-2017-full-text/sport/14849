Royals advance to World Series by beating Blue Jays in Game 6 of ALCS
Davis, who took over as the Royals' closer in September when Greg Holland was sidelined by a torn elbow ligament, gave up a single to Russell Martin and walked Kevin Pillar before striking out pinch-hitter Dioner Navarro with runners at first and third after a stolen base. After another stolen base put the potential go-ahead run at second, Davis struck out Ben Revere, then got Donaldson on a bouncer to third.
