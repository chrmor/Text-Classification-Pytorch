Horrific details emerge from James Hinchcliffe's Indy 500 practice crash
IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe is lucky to be alive, based on horrific details that have emerged about his wreck Monday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
RACER magazine reported Tuesday that Hinchcliffe was impaled by a piece of the car's suspension, which had to be cut from the chassis by IndyCar's Holmatro safety team to get the driver out of the vehicle.

The magazine cites an associate of Hinchcliffe's and confirmed via multiple sources that a steel "wishbone" entered the driver's compartment after the Honda's right side slammed into the wall during a practice run. The piece of metal then reportedly entered and exited the 28-year-old Canadian's right leg and entered his left thigh before stopping in his pelvic region.
Hinchcliffe suffered "massive" blood loss due to his injuries but was stabilized by medical workers at the track and in the ambulance before arriving at Methodist Hospital.
Video shows the crash, but not any of the injuries described above.
IndyCar has said only that Hinchcliffe underwent surgery on high upper left thigh and was in stable condition in intensive care Monday night.
Numerous drivers reportedly went to the hospital Monday to visit the driver, who likely is done with competition for the rest of the year, according to RACER.
