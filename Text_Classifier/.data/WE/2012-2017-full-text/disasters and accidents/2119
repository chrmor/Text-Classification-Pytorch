100 could be lost in asylum boat capsize
Hope is fast fading for as many as 100 people still missing after their boat capsized en route to Australia.
Indonesian and Australian authorities have rescued 109 people, including a 13-year-old boy, but have also pulled three bodies from the water.
Between 90 and 100 people are unaccounted for.
Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare says aircraft over the search and rescue area had spotted more bodies but no more survivors.
"We need to brace ourselves for more bad news," Mr Clare said on Friday.
The boat, crowded with asylum seekers, capsized about halfway between the Indonesian island of Java and Christmas Island on Thursday afternoon.
