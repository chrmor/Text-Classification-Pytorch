My Chemical Romance Break Up: 'Time For It To End'
My Chemical Romance has called it quits, the rock act announced on its website on Friday. The long-running group had been together for over a decade, releasing four studio albums.
"Being in this band for the past 12 years has been a true blessing. We've gotten to go places we never knew we would. We've been able to see and experience things we never imagined possible," the group said in a statement. "We've shared the stage with people we admire, people we look up to, and best of all, our friends. And now, like all great things, it has come time for it to end. Thanks for all of your support, and for being part of the adventure."
My Chemical Romance's most recent effort was "Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys," released in 2010. The album bowed at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, moving 112,000 copies.
The band's career ascended as they toured with Green Day, played Warped Tour and launched their own headlining run in 2005 as "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge," their major label debut, climbed up the charts. The album went platinum, a success matched by 2006 release "The Black Parade," which bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.
