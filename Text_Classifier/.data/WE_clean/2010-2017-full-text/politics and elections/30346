LGBTQ candidates win historic Election in Alaska
WASHINGTON, D.C.– Two Victory Fund endorsed candidates – Felix Rivera and Christopher Constant – won their races for Anchorage Assembly to become the only openly LGBTQ elected officials in Alaska. Tuesday’s wins are groundbreaking for Anchorage and the entire state, as both candidates faced numerous opponents and campaigned on their commitment to LGBTQ equality and social justice.
“These historic wins in Anchorage will reverberate throughout the entire state of Alaska,” said Victory Fund President & CEO Aisha C. Moodie-Mills. “There are currently zero LGBTQ elected officials serving in all of Alaska – so Felix and Alex will be much needed voices when they take office. We know that representation is power – and that LGBTQ elected officials humanize our lives and change political and policy debates. The wins for Felix and Christopher will lead to more inclusive legislation that benefits all residents of Anchorage.”
Felix won with 47 percent of the vote despite a crowded field and one of his opponents sending homophobic mailers the weekend before the election. The election win makes him the first openly LGBTQ Latino person to win an election in Alaska. Christopher, a long-serving LGBTQ activist in Alaska, faced five opponents and won with 52 percent of the vote. Both Felix and Christopher will be the first openly LGBTQ people to serve on the Assembly.
In the contiguous states, four Victory Fund endorsed candidates won local races in Illinois. In Berwyn, three LGBTQ candidates won races: Margaret Paul for Town Clerk, and Jose Ramirez and Jeanine Reardon for the Board of Aldermen. Openly LGBTQ candidate Nick Kachiroubas won his election to become Town Clerk of Crystal Lake. Three additional LGBTQ candidates who did not apply for Victory Fund’s endorsement also won their races in Berwyn.
