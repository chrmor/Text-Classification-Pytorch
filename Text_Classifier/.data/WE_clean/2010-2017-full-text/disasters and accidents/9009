A MAJOR 6.9-magnitude quake hit Peru's Pacific coast overnight, sparking panic among residents in the capital Lima and several other cities but no known casualties.
The epicentre of the quake was about 288km southeast of Lima, the US Geological Survey reported. Thousands of people evacuated buildings in Lima and other cities, but there were no immediate reports of damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre did not issue a widespread tsunami warning, but cautioned that quakes of this magnitude "sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive". The epicentre was located 51km southwest of the city of Ica, capital of the province of the same name, at a depth of 35km, the USGS said. On August 15, 2007, an earthquake of magnitude 7.9 with an epicentre close to that of Friday's quake devastated Ica province, killing about 600 people and causing extensive damage to area buildings and infrastructure. Today's quake was felt most acutely in the coastal area around Ica and south of Lima. But it was also felt in the high Andes "in cities like Cusco, Arequipa and Ayacucho, though it was less intense there", said Hernan Tavera, head of Peru's Geophysical Institute, which monitors earthquakes locally. Some phone lines were cut, but most appeared to have been quickly restored. In 2009, more than 140 earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.0 and above were felt in Peru, located on what geologists call the Pacific Ring of Fire due to its intense seismic activity.
