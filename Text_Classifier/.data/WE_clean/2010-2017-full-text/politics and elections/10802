Papua New Guinea politicians will hold a special sitting of parliament tomorrow to elect a new prime minister after the shock announcement that the prime minister's office was vacant.
Deputy speaker Francis Marus dropped the bombshell in parliament this morning, saying that in light of last week's Supreme Court ruling, Sir Michael Somare was the country's legitimate prime minister.
But he went on to say that because Sir Michael had missed three sittings of parliament, the leader's office was now vacant.
Shocked MPs held a lengthy meeting to discuss what had happened, then headed to the deputy speaker's office.
Peter O'Neill says he is the acting prime minister until tomorrow's vote.
Earlier today, he said parliament should not have sat this morning.
Parliament was scheduled to resume this afternoon, but at a press conference Mr O'Neill said his coalition stood by the deputy speaker's announcement.
Mr O'Neill urged Sir Michael's camp to show up tomorrow and put forward their nominee to settle the long-standing leadership impasse once and for all.
Parliament held a sitting on Friday, in which a motion was passed nullifying the Supreme Court's decision.
The government used that decision to then lay sedition charges against two judges - Sir Salamo Injia and Nicholas Kiriwom.
Mr O'Neill was this afternoon asked that if he now accepts the Supreme Court's decision, how can the judges be charged with sedition.
He said the matter is now in the hands of the police and he would not comment any further.
Mr O'Neill and his supporters claim Sir Michael missed three sittings of Parliament last year and that as a result he is no longer an MP.
They then passed motions and retrospective legislation enforcing Sir Michael's banning from parliament.
Mr O'Neill appears to still have the numbers and the support of most MPs and he is expected to be elected prime minister tomorrow.
