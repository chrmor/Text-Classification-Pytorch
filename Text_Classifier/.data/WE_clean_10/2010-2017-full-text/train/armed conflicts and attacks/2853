Over twenty people killed in clashes between Al-Shabaab and locals in central Somalia – GOOBJOOG NEWS
Twenty six people have been killed and several others wounded in an ongoing heavy fighting between Al-Shabaab and local militiamen in southern Mudug region in central Somalia.
The fighting erupted at Dumaaye village about 50km away from the Al-Shabaab-held Harardere town after resident took arms against Al-Shabaab over alms or Zakah (an Islamic levy on wealth).
Security Minister for Galmudug State in Somalia Osman Isse Nor told reporters that the militants were defeated during the fighting, noting that their attempt to revenge and rob locals failed.
“Our forces killed 26 terrorists and more others were injured, Galmudug State forces are part of the battle and supports the locals to fight Al-Shabaab in east of Mudug region,” Isse said.
Hussein Hassan, a local resident in Harardhere town said that 20 people from both sides died in the battle while 8 others sustained injuries.
“Locals, including nomadic people, took up arms against Al-Shabaab fighters who want to loot their resources, including livestock,” Hassan said.
Al-Shabaab adopted monthly Zakat that obliges every nomadic family with 10 heads of livestock to give away at least one, while those rearing as many as 20 are needed to contribute three in alms, according locals.
The group is carrying out hit and run attacks in major towns under government and deadly explosions in the capital Mogadishu.
