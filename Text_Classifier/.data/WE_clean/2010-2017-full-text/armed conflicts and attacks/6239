Guantánamo Bay files: Anti-extremist author framed and whisked to Cuba
Abdul Badr Mannan was handed over to Americans who later came to believe Pakistani intelligence had set him up
US forces sent an anti-extremist author to Guantánamo Bay after being misled by Pakistani authorities.
Abdul Badr Mannan and his brother were arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US forces. In the belief the two were affiliated with al-Qaida, his detention log states, they were transferred on to the Cuban base.
However, four months after assessing Mannan as a high-risk detainee, US forces came to a very different view, recommending his release. "The detainee was also thought to have some affiliation with the Jama'at Ul Dawa AlQurani (JDQ) group," his file states. "However, it appears the detainee may have been writing a book (detainee and his brother are published authors) concerning Islamic extremism and had merely established contacts to further his research and writing."
The file then states US suspicions about the reason for his initial arrest, blaming Pakistani intelligence for the error. "Detainee, in his writings, has also been extremely critical of the Pakistani intelligence service and their overt connections to extremism and al-Qaida.
"Detainee and his brother may have been arrested on that pretence and turned over to US authorities, who were misled as to the detainee's affiliations."
The report went on to stress that the Pakistani government had provided no evidence to back up its assertions that Mannan was a terrorist, and that the US government had no information about his affiliations.
