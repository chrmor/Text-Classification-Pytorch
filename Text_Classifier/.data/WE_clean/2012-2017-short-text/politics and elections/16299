United States President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a G20 working lunch meeting, traded views on Syria's civil war: where they agreed, i.e. UN negotiations, cease-fire, and Syrian-led political transition; and where they disagreed, i.e. President Bashar al-Assad's future role. Obama reiterated his support for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements on Ukraine, including Ukraine's control of its borders. (AP) (RT), (Reuters), (NBC News)
