Costa Concordia wreck: Search of cruise ship abandoned
Italian divers have abandoned their search for bodies inside the wrecked cruise ship Costa Concordia after conditions underwater deteriorated.
"We have definitively stopped the underwater search inside the ship," a spokesman for the fire brigade on the island of Giglio said.
Fifteen people are still missing after the ship ran aground off Italy on 13 January with the loss of 17 lives.
Work to recover the capsized vessel may take up to 10 months.
