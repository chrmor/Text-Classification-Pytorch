California Chrome wins 2014 Kentucky Derby
The most exciting two minutes in sports is now complete with the 140th running of the Kentucky Derby, and in the end, California Chrome was too much for the rest of the pack as he pulled away down the stretch to claim the victory.
Moments after the race was complete, the responses from around the twitter world were about as wonderful as youâ€™d imagine.
On a day when the Kings and Ducks meet for the first time in the playoffs, California Chrome takes the Derby. Awesome.
Chrome looks good. Hard part will be not getting boxed in at the final turn of the next two races. Can't explode if you don't have the room
Congratulations are in order for California Chrome and now let the Triple Crown chase officially begin.
