Separatists holed up in a trade union building were forced to jump from windows after it was set on fire by pro-Ukrainians. 
There were "many bodies lying on the ground covered with Ukraine flags", reported URIAN news agency which cited emergency sources saying "not less than 30 people are dead".
Another account claimed 38 were killed, many by smoke fumes but others suffered bullet wounds. 
At least 50 were wounded, including at least ten police, many from from gunshot wounds, in a night of chaos.
The horrific scenes came as President Barack Obama threatened Moscow with new tough sanctions if it refused to stop stirring the Ukrainian troubles. 
Gunmen on the roof shot at demonstrators below who were pelting the building with stones.
