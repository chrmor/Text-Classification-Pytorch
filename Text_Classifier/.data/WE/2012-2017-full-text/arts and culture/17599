Pop-up eatery The Bunyadi encourages customers to get naked
LONDON, April 21 (UPI) -- The creators of a planned pop-up restaurant in London where diners will be encouraged to eat in the nude conceded it might not be "a first date venue."
Development firm Lollipop announced its latest project, a pop-up eatery called The Bunyadi, is scheduled to open in June and will encourage customers to go au naturel as part of the business' efforts to create a "Pangaea-like world."
The eatery, which already has a reservation waiting list more than 13,000 patrons long, will include a special changing area where visitors will be asked to store their cellphones, clothes and other belongings. The restaurant will provide special robes for patrons that they will then be free to shed in their dining area at their own discretion.
"We believe people should get the chance to enjoy and experience a night out without any impurities: no chemicals, no artificial colors, no electricity, no gas, no phone and even no clothes if they wish to. The idea is to experience true liberation," Lollipop founder Seb Lyall said.
"We have worked very hard to design a space where everything patrons interact with is bare and naked. The use of natural bamboo partitions and candlelight has enabled to us to make the restaurant discreet, whilst adhering to the ethos behind it. No doubt, this has been the most challenging project for us yet, which makes us very excited about it," Lyall said.
Lyall said the restaurant, which is planned to operate for three months, is likely to appeal to vegans and naturists.
However, he conceded it might not be ideal for all situations: "It won't be a first date venue but certainly second dates and dinner with friends."
