Argentina former junta leaders jailed for baby theft
Two former military leaders in Argentina have been found guilty of overseeing the systematic theft of babies from political prisoners.
Relatives of the stolen children cheered as a court in Buenos Aires sentenced Jorge Videla (shown in this photo) to 50 years in prison and Reynaldo Bignone to 15 years.
At least 400 babies are thought to have been taken from their parents during Argentina's military rule.
Robert Cox is the former editor of the Buenos Aires Herald. He was the first journalist to report on the plot, but, as he told BBC World Service, the story did not start life as one about stolen babies, but missing adults.
