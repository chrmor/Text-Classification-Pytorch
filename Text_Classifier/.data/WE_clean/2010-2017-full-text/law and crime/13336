Pat Finucane's family denounce report as a 'sham'
Widow who campaigned for public inquiry into murder of Pat Finucane describes De Silva report as 'hurtful and insulting'
The Finucane family, who have campaigned for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, have described the report as a "sham" and a "whitewash".
Geraldine Finucane, the widow of the murdered lawyer, watched the debate on Sir Desmond de Silva's report (video) in the House of Commons before addressing a press conference in Westminster.
"What's most hurtful and insulting," she said, "is that this report is not the truth.
"It's a report into which we have had no input. The British government has engineered a suppression of the truth behind the murder of my husband."
Dead witnesses and now-defunct military organisations had been given the main share of the blame, she said.
Asked about the chances of a public inquiry being held, she said: "I'm not pessimistic. When others who support us [see this] they will realise that we are doing the right thing."
Michael Finucane, one of Finucane's sons, said: "This is another piece of the jigsaw. The report needs to be read and the documents studied.
"They are bare and cold, containing more shocking facts. That can be used to further our case for a public inquiry."
