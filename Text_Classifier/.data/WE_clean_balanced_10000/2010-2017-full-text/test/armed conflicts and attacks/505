Lebanese army “on alert” in Wadi Khaled
The Lebanese army said on Saturday that its units were on alert in Wadi Khaled after two people were killed and nine others wounded by rocket fire from Syrian territory and gun battles. “Army units in the area are on high alert [and] the required field measures were taken to [address] any violation of Syrian-Lebanese borders,” the army said in a statement.
Syrian troops have carried out a number of deadly cross-border raids into Lebanon since the outbreak of the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad's rule in March last year, sparking fears of a spillover of the conflict.
The Wadi Khaled region, about 185 kilometers from Beirut, encompasses areas of southern Syria and northern Lebanon and has been the site of frequent illegal border crossings.
