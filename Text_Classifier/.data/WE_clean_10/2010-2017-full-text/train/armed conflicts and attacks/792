Three Muslim rebels were killed following a clash with the government security forces in Southern Philippines Wednesday, military officials said Thursday.
A soldier meanwhile was wounded as a result of the hour-long firefight that started past 10:00 p.m. in the township of Pagalungan in Maguindanao, regional military spokesman Col. Prudencio Asto said.
Asto said the incident with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front was a violation to the parties ceasefire agreement ahead of the resumption of peace talks in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 9 and 10.
The MILF has been fighting government troops for decades to establish a self-rule Muslim state in the south of the predominantly Catholic country.
Peace talks between the government and the MILF remain stalled since August 2008 following the aborted signing of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain.
However, efforts are being undertaken by both sides to revive the talks. A final peace deal with the government will touch the issues of autonomy and the civil settlement of the rebel group's some 11,800-strong guerrilla fighters.
