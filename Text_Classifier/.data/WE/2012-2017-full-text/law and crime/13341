Vatican Prosecutor Indicts Defrocked Priest On Pedophilia Charges : The Two-Way : NPR
"Wesolowski was called back to the Vatican in 2013 after reports circulated in Santo Domingo that he had allegedly paid shoeshine boys to masturbate.
"Wesolowski, who was ordained a bishop in 2000, has since been defrocked and put under house arrest inside Vatican City â€” becoming the first person arrested in the Vatican on charges of pedophilia. A Vatican statement said the alleged crimes committed in the Dominican Republic were based on a police investigation there.
"The charge of having child pornography on his computer was based on a Vatican investigation after Wesolowski had been called back. At the time of his arrest the Vatican said that if convicted he could face up to 12 years in jail."
