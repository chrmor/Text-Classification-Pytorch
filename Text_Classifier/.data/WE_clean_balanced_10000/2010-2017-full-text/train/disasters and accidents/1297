Overnight house fire in Ohio kills 2 adults, 2 children
AKRON, Ohio (AP) â€” An overnight house fire has killed two adults and two young girls in Akron, Ohio.
Multiple media reports say the fire broke out about 1:30 a.m. Saturday when a caller reported people were trapped inside the house.
Media reports say one 12-year-old girl was rescued and a woman escaped by jumping from an attic window in the three-story house.
City spokeswoman Ellen Lander says the adults were a man and woman and the girls were about 7 or 8 years old.
Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James announced on Twitter that the girls who died were members of his foundation's educational program.
The Akron native wrote: "Unbelievably saddened to hear the news. My heart hurts."
The children attended Akron city schools. Counselors will be available at their schools next week.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
