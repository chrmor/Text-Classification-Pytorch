Mar Roxas seeks talks with Grace Poe
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines) — Administration presidential bet Manuel “Mar” Roxas II on Friday (May 6) called for unity with independent candidate Sen. Grace Poe amid the “uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship.”
Without referring to presidential survey frontrunner Rodrigo Duterte by name, he said that a leader is emerging who has no regard for honesty, integrity, transparency, responsibility, and “even basic decency.”
“Uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship are looming over our country once again,” Roxas said. “I call for unity, I call for decency, I call for democracy, I call for the rule of law.”
Roxas said more important than the political career of any candidate is the future of the country.
He called for a meeting with Poe. “Sabihan mo lang ako kung kailan at saan at darating ako.” [Just tell me when and where, and I’ll be there.]
He gave no indication about what he plans to do and what the purpose of the meeting will be.
“This is for unity, this is for the country, this is for our future,” he said.
