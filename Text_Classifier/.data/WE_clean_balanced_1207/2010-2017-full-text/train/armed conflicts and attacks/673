Canadian high commission in Dhaka reopens Monday
OTTAWA â€“ It will be business as usual Monday at the Canadian high commission in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.
A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird confirmed late Sunday that the mission would reopen after being shut down Sunday for security reasons.
The decision came after the U.S. issued a worldwide travel alert on Friday warning Americans that al-Qaida may be planning attacks in August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa.
The current travel warning on the Foreign Affairs site states, "There is no nationwide advisory in effect for Bangladesh. However, you should exercise a high degree of caution due to the fragile political situation. Political demonstrations, nationwide hartals (enforced strikes) and violent clashes are occurring frequently and are expected to continue. The security situation could deteriorate quickly."
The U.S. embassy in Dhaka was also closed Sunday.
