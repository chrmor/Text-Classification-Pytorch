11 killed in Malaysian bus accident
A collision involving two buses, a van and three cars left at least 11 people dead in Malaysia on Sunday, state media reported.
The accident occurred on the main North-South highway in the central state of Negeri Sembilan, Bernama reported, without providing further details.
The Star daily newspaper reported on its website that an express bus had crashed into a guard rail and ploughed into four vehicles near the Simpang Ampat exit on the highway. Police could not be reached for comment.
Last December, ten people were killed and two injured when a double-decker bus struck a metal guard rail and a road divider in northern Ipoh state.
Accidents involving interstate buses are common in Malaysia and there are frequent allegations that some drivers take drugs to keep themselves awake.
