Nauru: Asylum seeker sets herself on fire at Australia detention centre
A Somali woman seeking asylum in Australia has set herself on fire in protest at her detention at a centre on the Pacific island of Nauru.
The 21-year-old suffered critical injuries after covering herself in fuel and setting herself alight.
Last week, a 23-year-old Iranian died after setting himself alight at the same facility.
Nauru is one of several off-shore detention centres for asylum seekers operated by Australia.
Papua New Guinea last week announced it was closing a similar detention centre, at Manus Island, after its Supreme Court ruled it was illegal.
The young Somali woman is believed to have recently returned to Nauru, having been treated in Australia for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident on the island, Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said.
She is reportedly being treated on the island for burn injuries, and a request for a transfer to Australia for medical treatment has been made.
Mr Rintoul was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying there was "an epidemic of self-harm at Nauru".
A 23-year-old man known as Omid died in a Brisbane hospital on Friday, four days after setting himself alight in what the Nauru authorities said was a "political protest".
Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has admitted there have been incidents of self-harm on the small Pacific island.
"What we've been very clear about is that if people come to Australia for medical assistance they'll be returning back to Nauru once that medical assistance has been provided," he said.
He has also suggested that some of the 850 detainees at Manus Island may be moved to Nauru. They will not be allowed to come to Australia, he has said.
