Hong Kong protests: 'Gloomy unease' in wake of clashes
China has hit back at criticism of its decision to bar a UK parliamentary committee from entering Hong Kong, a former British colony.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing had made clear to the UK government many times that it opposed "the so-called delegation of the British parliament's foreign affairs committee going to Hong Kong for a so-called investigation".
Meanwhile Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung has warned pro-democracy activists not to return to the streets following the latest outbreak of violence.
His comments come after some of the worst clashes between protesters and police since the pro-democracy demonstrations began two months ago.
