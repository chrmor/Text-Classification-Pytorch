New Rochelle Police Officer Facing Vehicular Manslaughter Charges After Fatal Auto Collision in White Plains
NEW ROCHELLE, NY -- Harry Kyreakedes, 27, a first-year New Rochelle Police officer will be charged with vehicular manslaughter following a fatal single vehicle collision early Monday morning in White Plains, sources say.
Kyreakedes Blood Alcohol Content was 0.23, well above the legal limit, according to White Plains Public Safety Commissioner David Chong.
Kyreakedes graduated from the Westchester County Police Academy on December 18, 2015.
Isaac "Hooshie" Ward, 27, the sole passenger in the vehicle was killed on impact. He was taken to White Plains Hospital Center, where he was pronounced Dead on Arrival.
According to their Facebook pages, Kyreakedes and Ward were friends from Dobbs Ferry.
A black Jeep Cherokee driven by Kyreakede crashed into a tree on Mamaroneck Avenue. The charges will likely include a Driving While Intoxicated Charge, according to a high-ranking source with knowledge of the case.
"The investigation is being handled by White Plains PD," said New Rochelle City Manager Charles B. Strome.
"This is an active investigation," Chong said. "We'll have to find out where they were coming from and where they were headed to."
"It's a stark reminder to everyone of the dangers of drinking and driving," added Chong.
White Plains PD requested the assistance of the Westchester County PD Accident Investigation Unit, according to WCPD spokesperson Kieran O'Leary.
There are no signs that Kyreakedes applied the brakes prior to impact. He had to be cut out of the vehicle by White Plains firefighters, sources say. He was rushed to Westchester Medical Center where he underwent surgery. He suffered severe damage to his legs, according to one source.
The incident occurred shortly after 3:00 a.m.
The area on Mamaroneck Avenue near the Pedigree Ski Shop was closed off to traffic this morning awaiting investigators from New Rochelle PD and WCPD.
