First Green state premier likely to emerge from state elections (Germany)
In the US, given the same numbers, the winner of that election would be the CDU. The media coverage would treat it as though "the people" chose the CDU as WINNERS and that's that. The total numbers would barely be highlighted, that would be for wonks. Worse, SPD loyalists would be directing their anger not at the CDU but at the Greens for "spoiling" the election. No one would have any representation except the biggest party. This is the biggest problem we face here: it's impossible to just vote for what you want and get representation proportionate to your vote total. You either get the plurality or you get ignored completely. This is why we're stuck with the impenetrable two-party system with its permanent consensus in favor of Empire, Bankers and Profits Ueber Alles.
