Musharraf to launch new party
Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former president, is set to announce the launch of a new political party on Friday in London. 
The party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, will take part in the general elections planned for 2013.
Musharraf, who had seized power in 1999 through a bloodless military coup, told Al Jazeera in an exlusive interview that it is time for a new political culture that will represent the people and "shun dynastic politics". 
The move comes as Pakistan's current government is being criticised for its response to floods that devastated the country.
