Strong quake strikes near Fukushima
A strong earthquake has struck near the troubled nuclear power plant at the centre of Japan's radiation crisis, the meteorological agency said.
The agency said there was no fear of a tsunami following the quake, whose magnitude was recorded at 6.0 by the agency on Wednesday.
Public broadcaster NHK said there was no immediate report of further damage to nuclear power plants in Fukushima, including the Fukushima No. 1, which was crippled by the March 11 quake.
