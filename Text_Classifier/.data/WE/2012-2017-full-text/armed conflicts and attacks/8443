Palestinian wounded as violent incidents continue on Gaza border -  Haaretz - Israel News
A Palestinian was wounded by Israel Defense Forces fire on the Gaza border on Saturday, following several violent border incidents on Friday.
A 22-year-old Palestinian was killed near Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, in one of Friday's incidents, according to Palestinian sources. Four other Palestinians were wounded in incidents that occurred in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip and in Jabaliya in the north.
The IDF said that its soldiers used live fire to contain a number of violent incidents near the border and "several hits were identified", but did not confirm any dead or wounded.  Palestinians damaged the fence in the northern part of the border, a mortar was fired into Israel, and in one area Gazans tried to cross into Israel, the military said in a statement.
In Saturday's incident, IDF troops opened fire on several suspects who approached the fence and laid an explosive device, the army reported. According to Palestinian reports, however, the wounded man was part of a group of farmers. The incident took place east of Khan Yunis. On Thursday, a Palestinian man was killed during an Israeli military operation in the West Bank town of Qalqilyah, only hours after a Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces in Jenin.
An elite force from the Paratroopers Brigade came under fire while attempting to capture a terrorist cell in Qalqilyah, located some 20 kilometers west of Nablus, the Israel Defense Forces said, adding that the Palestinian was killed after the force returned fire.
Palestinian sources said the man who was killed was 28-year-old Saleh Yassin, a member of the Palestinian general intelligence service. ן.
