John Kerry breaks leg in bicycle crash in France
The US Secretary of State John Kerry has broken his leg in a biking accident in the French Alps.
Mr Kerry, 71, was in a stable condition in hospital in nearby Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman said.
He was expected to make a full recovery after breaking his right femur and was in good spirits, said John Kirby.
Mr Kerry, who was in Switzerland for talks on Iran's nuclear programme, has called off visits to Madrid and Paris and will fly to the US for treatment.
The accident took place in Scionzier, France, some 40km (25 miles) south-east of the Swiss border.
It appeared Mr Kerry hit a kerb and there was no vehicle involved in the accident, a state department official was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
"Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with the secretary's motorcade at the time of the accident," the state department said.
Mr Kerry "did not lose consciousness", it added.
Mr Kerry was taken by helicopter to a hospital to Geneva, from where he will now be flown to Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, Mr Kirby said.
Given the injury was near the site of his prior hip surgery Mr Kerry would be treated by the doctor who performed the operation, the spokesman added.
Mr Kerry will no longer travel to Madrid on Monday to sign a defence deal and to Paris on Tuesday for talks on combating Islamic State militants.
Mr Kerry is known for his love of cycling and often takes his bike with him when he travels.
In 1992, he injured his shoulder while riding a bike.
