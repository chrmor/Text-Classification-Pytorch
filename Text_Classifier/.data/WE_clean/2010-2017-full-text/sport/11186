Ukraine vs. England: Marko Devic Enters Goal-Line Technology Hall of Shame
Euro 2012 may well be the last major tournament before goal-line technology is introduced, but that won't come as a consolation for Ukraine's Marko Devic, or the host nation's devastated fans for that matter.
Devic's shot against England clearly crossed the line before John Terry hooked it clear. But neither the referee, his assistant nor the fifth official behind the goal could confirm it.
Play continued and Devic's phantom effort entered the goal-line technology hall of shame—to join the likes of Frank Lampard's effort against Germany at the 2010 World Cup.
Had it stood, Ukraine would have drawn level at 1-1 in the Group D decider, with 30 minutes to go and a partisan crowd at fever pitch.
The momentum would have returned and, who knows, the co-hosts may well have scored a second goal to send England home and book a quarterfinal spot.
Now it's worth pointing out that Artem Milevskiy was offside in the buildup to the "ghost goal," so we should never have reached Devic's opening in the first place.
But no flag was raised, so all focus turns to the goal-line decision. The Hungarian officials got it wrong and UEFA president Michel Platini—a man famously opposed to goal-line technology—now faces some difficult questions. 
FIFA have made their decision, so we can be pretty certain goal-line technology will be with us at the 2014 World Cup.
UEFA are opposed, however, so there's a chance we could stay without goal-line technology in the Champions League and European Championships for some time.
But after the latest high-profile mistake, it's going to take a seriously stubborn stance from Platini and his cohorts to resist it.
That's exactly what we've been dealing with so far, and exactly the reason this happened to Ukraine against England.
