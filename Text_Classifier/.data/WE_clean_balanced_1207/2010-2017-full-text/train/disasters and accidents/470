SKorean freighter missing off Uruguay
A South Korean freighter with 24 people on board is missing in the Atlantic and is presumed capsized off the coast of Uruguay, according to media reports.
An oil slick some 3700km off the coast indicated that the 266,000-tonne Stellar Daisy had gone down, the Uruguayan navy said in a statement.
The vessel had issued an SOS on Friday.
South Korea's foreign ministry said on Sunday that two Filipino crew members were rescued floating in a life raft on Saturday, but other lifeboats and rafts found in the area were empty, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
"A search operation is continuing for the 22 people," a South Korean foreign ministry official in Seoul said by telephone, adding eight of the missing are South Korean nationals and 14 are Filipinos.
Yonhap reported that crew members had sent a text message on Friday to say that the Stellar Daisy was sinking.
It was en route from Brazil to South Africa.
