ISIS assaults Iranian base in east Homs, no survivors
BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:40 P.M.) – The ISIS terrorist group has released a 7-minute video showing their forces raiding an Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) base in vast desert spaces of eastern Homs Governorate.
As can be seen in the video, the raid against the Iranian base was massive, involving at least 100 ISIS fighters mounted into makeshift armored personnel carriers (APC) and Toyota pickups.
In a fashion typical of most ISIS raids, the terrorist group’s militants unleashed a hail of tracer-heavy machine gun fire (of all calibers) and rocket launcher fire to stun Iranian-led forces (some of which were Iraqi paramilitaries). Moving right up to the earth-walls of the IRGC outpost and surrounding it, Islamic State fighters then proceeded to pick-off Iranian and Iraqi troops who are unable to flee the site.
Considering the sheer surprise and overwhelming force by which ISIS conducted the raid, it is clear that the Iranian-led forces within the base never really had any chance to defend their position or even withdraw from it.
It appears that the IRGC forward outpost was manned by between twelve to eighteen troops, all but one of which were killed outright. As shown in the video, the one Iranian soldier who survives the gunfight is snatched by the terrorist group, driven back to ISIS-held territory, decapitated and left to rot in public view.
