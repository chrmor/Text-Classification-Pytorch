Obama Heckled On Guantanamo Bay
President Barack Obama was interrupted by Code Pink founder Medea Benjamin three times during a major foreign policy speech Thursday when talking about closing Guantanamo Bay and discussing his administration's policy on drone strikes.
The second time she interrupted, Obama became irritated.
"Part of free speech is you being able to speak, but also me being able to speak. And you listening," Obama said to applause.
Obama conceded after she left, however, that she had a point.
"The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to," Obama said. "Obviously, I do not agree with much of what she said. And obviously, she wasn't listening to me in much of what I said. But, these are tough issues. And the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong."
The first time Benjamin spoke up to interrupt, the crowd applauded her.
"Let me finish, ma'am," Obama said.
"It's not Congress. It's you, sir!" she shouted back. "... You are Commander-in-Chief!"
"Ma'am, thank you," Obama said, after a few failed attempts to get in a word. "You should let me finish my sentence. Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from Gitmo."
Here's the video of her first interruption, which centered on drone policy. This was when she was escorted out of the speech:
