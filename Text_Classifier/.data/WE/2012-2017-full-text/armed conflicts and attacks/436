UN resolution would condemn Syrian regime
A proposed UN General Assembly resolution would strongly condemn human rights violations by the Syrian regime and back an Arab League plan aimed at ending the country's 11-month conflict.
The non-binding resolution demands that the Syrian government stop all violence, release detainees and withdraw all armed forces from cities and towns. It demands the Assad regime guarantee peaceful demonstrations and allow unhindered access for Arab League monitors and international media.
The draft, circulated on Tuesday by Egypt, makes no specific reference to the Arab League's call Sunday for a joint Arab-UN peacekeeping force for Syria.
Diplomats say the resolution is likely to be put to a vote on Thursday in the 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes.
