European Central Bank Breaks New Ground to Press Growth
FRANKFURT — Banks typically make money on the cash they park at a central bank. Now the European Central Bank wants them to pay for the privilege.
The move, a so-called negative interest rate, is part of a wide-ranging set of measures aimed at combating the crippling combination of slow growth and superlow inflation.
The initiatives, announced on Thursday by the European Central Bank, include the usual fare — interest rate cuts and cheap bank loans. But the bank also showed a willingness to test new tools like the negative interest rate, in a nod to just how worrisome the economic situation has become in Europe.
Taken collectively, the measures send a strong message to investors, businesses, and citizens that the central bank is determined to put Europe on a path to stronger growth.
