Putin critic Navalny detained by police, his wife says
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police detained Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at the entrance of his home on Monday, just before an unsanctioned rally he was going to hold in central Moscow, but the protest will still go ahead, his wife said on Twitter.
Electricity in Navalny’s office was switched off, his spokeswoman said in a separate Twitter message. A live Internet feed run from Navalny’s office went off air.
