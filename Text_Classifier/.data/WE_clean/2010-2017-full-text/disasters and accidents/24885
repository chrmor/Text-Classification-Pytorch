A police official told The Hindu: ‘We can rule out the possibility of any terror angle or sabotage.
‘Not a single ingredient pertaining to any kind of explosive was found at the site.
‘We are convinced that it is a meteorite that fell with high velocity.’
Meteorites are pieces of rock or metal that fall to earth from outer space.
However, other newspapers reported the possibility of a drone being involved.
Witnesses said they did not know what happened, but saw a mysterious object fall from the sky.
