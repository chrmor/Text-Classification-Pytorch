Suspect slays man, wounds vic's brother after NYC soccer game
A knife fight erupted after a midnight soccer match in Brooklyn, killing a 31-year-old man and critically wounding his brother early Sunday, a police source said.
Paramedics found Delvin Martinez with severe stab wounds to his torso and neck around 12:30 a.m. outside the Beginning with Children Charter School 2 on Heyward St. in Williamsburg, cops said.
They took him to Woodhull Hospital, where he died from his injuries two hours later.
The assailant also attacked Martinez's 29-year-old brother Oscar, stabbing him in the torso, neck and face across the street from the Williamsburg Armory.
