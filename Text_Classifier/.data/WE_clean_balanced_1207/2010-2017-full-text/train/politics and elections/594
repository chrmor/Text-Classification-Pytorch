Sweeney withdraws from Donegal by-election
Independent candidate Ann Sweeney has withdrawn from the Donegal South West by-election.
Speaking this morning, Ms Sweeney called on the people of Donegal South West to boycott the by-election.
She said that she feels Thursday's election is a complete farce.
Ms Sweeney said Ireland needs a new national emergency Government that will put the lives of the most marginalised to the fore.
However, the independent said she intends to stand in the General Election in the new year.
The residents of Donegal's islands cast their votes yesterday.
