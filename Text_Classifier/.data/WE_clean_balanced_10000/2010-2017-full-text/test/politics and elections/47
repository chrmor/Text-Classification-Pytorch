Netanyahu dismisses security Cabinet meeting over leaks
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the second part of a meeting held by the ministerial committee for defense and security due to a recent report published by Ynet on Iran.
Netanyahu said that "shortly after the first Cabinet meeting ended, information regarding Iran was leaked to the press. Israel's security depends on its capability to hold confidential deliberations." (Atilla Somfalvi)
