Melbourne Cup 2015: Prince of Penzance the first 100-1 winner since World War II
It was a historic Melbourne Cup in numerous respects. Not least was the price of the winner - Prince of Penzance - who saluted with Michelle Payne in the saddle at 100-1, making it the equal fourth biggest outsider to win Australia's most famous horse race.
No horse had won at triple-figure odds since World War II. Old Rowley in 1940 was the winner at $101, with Wotan in 1936 and The Pearl in 1871 the only other horses to have provided such value.
Bart Cummings' last cup winner - Viewed - had been the previous longest-shot to win this century after edging out Bauer at 40-1 in 2008.
Trainer Darren Weir's six-year-old gelding was one of just three horses to have started on Tuesday at odds of 100-1 or greater.
