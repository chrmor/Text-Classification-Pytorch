Rugby Championship: Argentina 21-17 Australia
Argentina came from 14-0 down to defeat Australia and earn their first win since joining the Rugby Championship.
The Wallabies struggled for discipline and had both Nick Phipps and captain Michael Hooper sin-binned in Mendoza.
Although tries from Tevita Kuridrani and Scott Higginbotham gave them an early advantage, Leonardo Senatore's try cut the deficit before half-time.
Argentina took the lead thanks to Juan Imhoff's converted try on 53 minutes and maintained their advantage after.
Australia's Bernard Foley hit the post with a penalty with 10 minutes to go, although his cause was not helped by a laser pen aimed at his face as he teed up the attempt.
Nicolas Sanchez kicked a penalty with six minutes to go after Hooper was sin-binned and the Wallabies were unable to find the try they needed in the closing stages.
The Pumas' first win in 18 Rugby Championship matches was also their first over Australia since 1997 and ended an eight-match losing streak.
