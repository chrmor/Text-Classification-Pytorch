Tropical Storm Harvey forms in the Caribbean
(CNN) -- A tropical storm formed in the Caribbean Friday and is expected to move across the coast of Belize Saturday afternoon or night.
Tropical Storm Harvey has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, with higher gusts, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.
The storm is forecast to strengthen somewhat before its center reaches Belize.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast of Belize and for the Bay Islands of Honduras, which Harvey is predicted to pass near late Friday. A warning is also in effect for the southeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, from Punta Gruesa south to Chetumal, in Mexico.
A tropical storm watch is in effect for the coast of Guatemala and for parts of the coast of Honduras.
A warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected within 36 hours, while a watch means that storm conditions are possible within 48 hours.
As of 8 p.m. ET, Harvey was about 130 miles east of Isla Roatan, Honduras, heading west at 9 mph.
The storm is predicted to dump 3 to 5 inches of rain across Honduras, Guatemala, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula, with up to 8 inches possible in some places. A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the coast near and to the north of where Harvey makes landfall.
