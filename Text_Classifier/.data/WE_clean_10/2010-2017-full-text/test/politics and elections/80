Serbian Opposition Rallies Against Alleged Election Fraud
Around 2,000 people have protested in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, alleging falsification of the April 24 snap parliamentary elections and to demand that an upcoming repeat vote at 15 polling stations be held fairly. The protesters on April 30 accused Prime Minister Aleksandr Vucic of manipulating the results of the initial ballot in order to prevent the far-right Dveri party from reaching the 5-percent threshold and gaining seats in the legislature. According to preliminary results, Dveri was literally one vote short of reaching the hurdle and picking up 13 legislative seats. If Dveri fails to make it into parliament, Vucic's Progressive Party would take seven of the available seats. Election officials have called for a new vote at 15 polling stations where voting irregularities have been found. About 18,000 voters will be eligible to participate in the May 4 repeat ballot. Supporters of former President Boris Tadic also participated in the April 30 rally. His election bloc is several hundred votes short of the 5 percent hurdle.
