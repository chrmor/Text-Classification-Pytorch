Long-Dreaded Superbug Found in Human and Animal in U.S. â€“ Phenomena: Germination
Maryn McKenna is an award-winning journalist and the author of two critically acclaimed books, Superbug (2010) and Beating Back the Devil (2004). She writes for Wired, Scientific American, Slate, Nature, the Atlantic, the Guardian and others, and is a Senior Fellow of the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University.
At Germination, she'll explore public health, global health, and food production and policy: ancient diseases, emerging infections, antibiotic resistance, agricultural planning, foodborne illness, and how we'll feed an increasingly crowded world.
