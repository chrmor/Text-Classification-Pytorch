Power outages hit Mexico City after quake in country's center
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Power outages hit the Mexican capital of Mexico City on Sunday after an earthquake struck the center of the country, and officials said there was no other damage reported.
Some restaurants and residential buildings in the capital were evacuated as a precautionary measure, they said.
Buildings shuddered in the city, a Reuters witness said.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) downgraded its initial measurement of the quake to magnitude 5.8 from 6.0.
No one at state oil company Pemex was immediately available to comment but the group has no major installations near the epicenter of the quake, 14 miles west of Jolalpan in southwest Mexico, 76 miles south of Mexico City.
