Mossad chief to apologize to Britain
LONDON, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- Israel will apologize for using British passports in the assassination of a Hamas operative in Dubai, Mossad insiders said.
The Daily Telegraph Saturday quoted Israeli sources saying newly appointed Mossad head Tamir Pardo will promise British Foreign Secretary William Hague that the agency will refrain from using fake British documents in operations abroad.
He is expected to meet with British officials in January, the newspaper said.
Britain in March expelled a Mossad official from London after it was discovered that 12 British passports were used by a hit squad to kill Hamas operative Mahmoud al Mabhouh in his Dubai hotel room in January.
Israel never officially acknowledged it was responsible for Mabhouh's death.
Dubai authorities named Israel as the chief suspect and said it sent a hit squad who used an array of forged passports from Britain, Ireland, France, Germany and Australia to enter the country and carry out the killing.
Outgoing Mossad chief Meir Dagan refused to apologize to Britain for using the forged documents, The Jerusalem Post said.
