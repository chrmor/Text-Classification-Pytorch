Insurgents Target Afghan Officials, Police
KABUL, Afghanistanâ€”A roadside bomb killed a district government chief and three of his bodyguards on Sunday in eastern Afghanistan, officials said.
The incident followed the killings on Saturday of 11 Afghan police by a fellow officer. The bloody weekend showed how much instability remains in the country, even as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is aiming to hand over security responsibility to local forces at the end of 2014 after more than a decade of warfare against insurgents.
