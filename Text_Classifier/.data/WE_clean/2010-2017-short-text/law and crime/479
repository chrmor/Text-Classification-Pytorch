Mordechai Vanunu, who spoke about Israel's nuclear ambitions to The Sunday Times in 1986 and was referred to as a "prisoner of conscience" by Amnesty International after Israel imprisoned him for that action, is released from prison again after serving three months for meeting foreigners, including his Norwegian girlfriend, in 2007. He requests that he be allowed to leave Israel. (Haaretz) (The Guardian)
