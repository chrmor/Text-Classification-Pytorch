Victory in the Pacific: Four things you likely never knew about the day celebrating the end of World War II
On August 15, 1945, the Empire of Japan accepted the Allies' demand for an unconditional surrender, effectively putting an end to World War II after the devastating nuclear bombing of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Jubilation erupted on the streets of the nation's cities, as then prime minister Ben Chifley announced over the radio: "Fellow citizens, the war is over ... let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may look forward to a peace which they have won for us."
This day came to be known as Victory in the Pacific (VP) Day.
Here are four things you probably never knew about VP Day.
According to the Australian War Memorial, Victory in Japan Day was the preferred title of the United States, the UK and New Zealand, and still is to this day.
A popular myth suggests the day was originally named as such in Australia and surreptitiously changed later, but this is false.
It has always been called Victory in the Pacific Day, or VP Day for short, in Australia.
Due to the location of the international date line, Japan's surrender actually occurred on August 14 in the Americas and Europe.
On September 2, 1945, Japanese envoys boarded the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay and formally signed the surrender document.
Half an hour later, 42 US ships entered Tokyo Bay, with 13,000 American troops landing on Japanese soil.
Japan's sovereignty is still to this day confined to the four islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, plus minor islands determined by the allies.
This was enshrined in the Potsdam Declaration, the conditions of Japan's surrender.
Japan remains unable to re-arm itself for war and its military only operates as a self-defence force, but this has become a topic of much discussion and possible change inside modern Japan.
