Landing gear collapse at Jersey Airport
The undercarriage of a plane carrying 43 people gave way after landing at Jersey Airport.
The ATR 42 plane from Guernsey had touched down and was taxiing to its stand when there appeared to be a "collapse" of the undercarriage.
A spokesman for airline Blue Islands said the plane was evacuated in less than a minute and no-one was hurt.
Flights were suspended and the runway was closed for more than seven hours on Saturday.
People with flights booked have been advised to check in as normal, but one passenger said the lack of information had been "disappointing".
Jersey Airport said the incident, which happened at 08:30 BST, had been dealt with by the island's emergency services.
Doug Bannister, Jersey Airport's chief executive, told BBC News the incident would have been more serious if the failure had occurred as the plane was landing.
"If the landing gear had collapsed directly on landing it would have been a much larger incident because the plane is clearly going much faster," he said.
Blue Islands said the plane was evacuated within 45 seconds and the incident had been well managed and controlled by the crew who ensured passengers were "safely and quickly escorted from the aircraft".
A statement from the airline said: "We are currently working with Air Accidents Investigation Branch to fully understand the facts of this unfortunate matter.
"A full investigation into the incident is under way."
A witness at the airport said the plane was travelling down the runway, when it appeared to "to fall over".
An airport spokesman said the priority was to stay open as late as possible to help passengers continue with their journey.
"Jersey Airport would like to apologise for the inconvenience this disruption has caused and would like to thank airport users for their patience and understanding," he added.
