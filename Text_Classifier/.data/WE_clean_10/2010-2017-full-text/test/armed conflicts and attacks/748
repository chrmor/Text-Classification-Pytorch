One killed as mob attacks Jonathan in Uganda
UGANDAN police shot at a crowd in the capital Kampala after it attacked a car carrying Nigeria’s President Goodluck Jonathan who had attended President Yoweri Museveni’s inauguration, a government spokesman said.
At least one person was killed in the incident.
“The car belonging to Goodluck Jonathan was stoned by mobs,” said Fred Opolot, director of the government media centre. “The security shot around the area, and one person was shot dead.”
Meanwhile, the Presidency in Nigeria has denied the attack. Presidential spokesman Emma Niboro said the attack was not targeted at President Jonathan.
Musevei was  sworn in to a fourth term. Opposition leader Kizza Besigye over the last month has been leading “walk to work” protests over the rising cost of food and fuel. Besigye, whom Museveni defeated in his February re-election win, said the marches are also to protest government corruption.
Those marches have been the most serious unrest in sub-Saharan Africa since protests swept out leaders in Egypt and Tunisia. Museveni says he will not be swept from office by Egypt-style protests.
A 21-gun salute rang out before a crowd of thousands who watched the country’s chief justice administer an oath to Museveni. Leaders from Kenya, Tanzania, Southern Sudan, Nigeria, Congo, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe attended the ceremony.
