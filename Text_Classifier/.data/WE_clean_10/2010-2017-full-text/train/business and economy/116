Ratings News Hits Italian Stocks
Italian stocks fell, leading declines in fiscally weaker euro-zone countries, after Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of the country's creditworthiness.
Late Friday, Fitch cut Italy's credit rating by one notch to BBB+ with a negative outlook, noting increased political uncertainty. News of the downgrade reinforced "the perception that the nation, post the recent election, is ungovernable and that a second election is all but certain," said Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas.
