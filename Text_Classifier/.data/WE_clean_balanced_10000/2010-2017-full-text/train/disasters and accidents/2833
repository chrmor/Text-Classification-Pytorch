Lisa becomes 7th hurricane of the season
MIAMI, Sept. 24 (UPI) -- Tropical Storm Lisa strengthened rapidly in the Atlantic Ocean to become the season's seventh hurricane, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Friday.
Lisa was located about 385 miles northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, moving north at 8 mph with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, the center said in its 7 p.m. EDT advisory.
The Category 1 hurricane is expected to continue moving north through late Saturday, with a possible turn toward the north-northwest Saturday night.
The center said Lisa is a "rather small tropical cyclone" with hurricane force winds extending outward up to 10 miles from the eye of the storm.
Lisa is expected to strengthen through Saturday, then begin to weaken gradually.
