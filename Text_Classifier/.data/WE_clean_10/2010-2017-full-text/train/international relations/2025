N. Korea Says Rockets to U.S. 'Inevitable' as American Jets Stage Show of Force
Ri’s speech capped a week of rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, with Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trading insults. Trump called Kim a “madman” on Friday, a day after Kim dubbed him a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”
On Saturday, the mudslinging continued with Ri calling Trump “a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency” who is trying to turn the United Nations into a “gangsters’ nest.” Ri said Trump himself was on a “suicide mission” after the U.S. president had said Kim was on such a mission.
Trump then rounded off a day of newsworthy Twitter activity with his new threat.
"'President Evil’ is holding the seat of the U.S. President,” Ri told the annual gathering of world leaders, warning that Pyongyang was ready to defend itself if the U.S. showed any sign of conducting a “decapitating operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country.”
“Now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force.”
He said sanctions would have no effect on Pyongyang’s resolve to develop its nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal being “balance of power with the U.S.”
Trump announced new U.S. sanctions against the impoverished and isolated country on Thursday, targeting foreign companies that deal with the North.
Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth round of sanctions onPyongyangto counter its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.
