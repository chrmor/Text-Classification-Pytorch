Syria Rebels Say Plane from Iraq Bombed Eastern City
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting raged on Friday between Syrian insurgents and loyalists in the northern suburbs of Damascus, northern Idlib Province and areas near Syria’s southern and eastern borders, antigovernment activists reported, including what they described as a deadly military airstrike that may have originated in Iraq.
The battles were reported as the United Nations refugee agency announced that the number of Syrian refugees in surrounding countries now exceeded 1.4 million, far more than had been projected months ago. The agency also said financing problems were forcing it to curtail some health services to the refugees.
Activist groups in eastern Syria asserted that the military airstrike, which hit the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, was carried out by a warplane that had flown across the border with Iraq. Some accused Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq, whose Shiite-dominated government is engrossed in a worsening conflict with Sunni militants, of ordering the strike. Others said the plane was a Syrian Air Force MiG that had crossed into Iraqi airspace before turning back into Syria for its bombing sortie.
There was no independent confirmation of the origin of the aircraft, and no immediate comment from Mr. Maliki’s government.
Mr. Maliki has warned that the fighting in Iraq could lead to a civil war like the one consuming Syria, where a Sunni-led insurgency is seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad, whose minority Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
The eastern command of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group, issued a statement blaming the Maliki government: “This attack is a flagrant violation perpetrated by Maliki forces against our people in Deir al-Zour in collaboration with Assad gangs, and we will not forgive them this brutal, barbaric assault.”
