Morocco claims arrests in Sahara protest camp
Morocco's official news agency says that the country's security forces have carried out arrests in a camp set up by protesters in the disputed Western Sahara territory. The MAP news agency report conflicts with claims by the Polisario Front of an armed confrontation against the Saharawi people with some 100 wounded. The conflicting reports come ahead of the reopening of informal talks on Monday between Morocco and the Polisario organization on the fate of the vast Western Sahara. MAP said Monday that security forces arrested "elements threatening" people inside the camp outside the territory's capital Laayoune. It didn't elaborate. Morocco seeks autonomy for the Western Sahara which it annexed in 1975. The Polisario wants independence for the mineral-rich region.
