Many-headed dog, goddess lend names to Pluto moons
Pluto's fourth and fifth moons, discovered in 2011 and 2012, have been named Kerberos and Styx, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) said on Tuesday.
Formerly known as P4 and P5, the names were submitted by the astronomers who found them, with input from the general public in an open contest, the Paris-based organisation said.
Kerberos is the Greek spelling for the name Cerberus - a many-headed dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology.
Styx was the name of the goddess who ruled over an underworld river by the same name.
The moons were discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope.
