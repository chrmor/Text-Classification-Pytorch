Alaska Airlines cancels dozens of Seattle flights
Dozens of flights were canceled Tuesday in Seattle as icy conditions continued to grip Sea-Tac Airport.
Thirty-five cancellations were from Alaska Airlines, and a total of 87 flights were canceled.
While plane de-icing happens routinely before takeoff at airports across the Last Frontier, cool weather strains resources at the busy Seattle airport where warmer temperatures are the norm.
Because of the broad delays, Alaska is allowing customers to change or refund tickets without incurring a fee for travel originally scheduled for Dec. 5 or Dec. 6.
Alaska customers will be notified if their flight is canceled, but travelers flying through Seattle on any air carrier should check the website they used to book before arriving at the airport.
The news comes a day after 6,300 Alaska Airlines customers were impacted by cancellations.
