A spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of People's Republic of China says Taiwan is barred from observing this yearâ€™s World Health Assembly because current President Tsai Ing-wen has not endorsed the Beijing view that both sides belong to a single China under the One-China policy; the spokesman further said that the health of people in Taiwan is not being put at risk by Taiwan's inability to attend.
