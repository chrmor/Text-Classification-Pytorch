Danish Tourist Says She Was Gang-Raped in India
NEW DELHI — A 51-year-old Danish woman said she was gang-raped at knife point by seven or eight men in central New Delhi after she approached them to ask for directions to her hotel, the Delhi police reported on Wednesday.
Late Wednesday night, the police announced the arrest of two men they described as “vagabonds” living at the capital’s railway station, and said they had property stolen from the tourist, including a glasses case, an iPod and earplugs.
The woman, who was staying at a hotel in an area popular with backpackers, told the police that the men had taken her to a secluded spot near the railway station on Tuesday and raped her repeatedly, said Rajan Bhagat, a spokesman for the Delhi police.
The woman arrived in Delhi on Monday from Agra, the site of the Taj Mahal, and was planning to leave India on Wednesday morning, said a manager at the hotel where she was staying.
