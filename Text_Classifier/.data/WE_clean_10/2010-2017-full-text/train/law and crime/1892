Woman Found Guilty of Murder in 1991 Death of Her Son, 5
When 5-year-old Timothy Wiltsey vanished on a spring evening in 1991, the story his mother told the police was chilling — every parent’s worst nightmare made real. His mother, Michelle Lodzinski, maintained that Timmy, as he was known, had disappeared from a town carnival in New Jersey.
Five months later, the boy’s sneaker was found in a swampy part of an industrial park where his mother once worked. His remains were found there too, six months after that.
But it would take a blue blanket, its color long faded but the memory of it held firm by those who had seen it covering Timmy long ago, to finally break the case.
On Wednesday, 25 years after Timmy disappeared, a jury found his mother guilty of his murder, closing one of the state’s most notorious cold cases.
