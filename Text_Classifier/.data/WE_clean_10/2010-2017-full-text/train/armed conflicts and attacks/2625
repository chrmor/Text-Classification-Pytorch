Nine People in Need local staff killed in attack in Afghanistan
The Czech aid organisation People in Need has suspended all its activities in Afghanistan after nine of its local employees were killed in an attack on Monday. The NGO has also taken steps to ensure the safety of its staff in Afghanistan in the wake of the attack in the Zari district in the north of the country. The victims included seven aid workers – six men and one woman – and two guards. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but it comes as the Taliban have intensified their annual spring offensive.
