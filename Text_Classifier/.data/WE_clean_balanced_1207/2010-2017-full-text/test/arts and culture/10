The British Academy of Film and Television Arts celebrated its biggest night tonight at London’s Royal Opera House, which ended with kudos going to Alejandro G Inarritu and The Revenant. The movie won Best Director, Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, and Best Film. It took five awards total, including Cinematography (with Emmanuel Lubezki becoming only the second person to win three years in a row) and Sound. But in the technicals, Mad: Max Fury Road drove away with four wins. A total of 14 films took prizes, but there was no love for Carol, which had nine noms. Bridge of Spies, also with nine noms, won only one prize, for Mark Rylance in Supporting Actor. Best Actress went to Brie Larson in Room, further cementing her journey to the Oscars.
