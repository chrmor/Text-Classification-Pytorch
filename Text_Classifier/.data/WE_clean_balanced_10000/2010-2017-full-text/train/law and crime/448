Mubarak goes on trial in hospital bed
An ailing, 83-year-old Hosni Mubarak, lying ashen-faced on a hospital bed inside a metal defendants cage with his two sons standing protectively beside him in white prison uniforms, pleaded innocent to charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters at the start of his historic trial on Wednesday.
The spectacle, aired live on state television, was the biggest humiliation for Egypt's former president since his ouster nearly six months ago after an 18-day uprising.
But it went a long way to satisfy one of the key demands that has united protesters since February 11, the day he was toppled.
It was the first time Egyptians have seen Mubarak since Feb 10, when he gave a defiant TV address refusing to resign.
"I am delighted that I see them in a cage. I feel that my son's soul is finally starting to be at rest and that his blood will cool," said Saeeda Hassan Abdel-Raouf, the mother of a 22-year-old protester killed in the uprising.
In the courtroom, a prosecutor read the charges against Mubarak - that he was an accomplice along with his then-interior minister in the "intentional and premeditated murder of peaceful protesters" and that he and his sons received gifts from a prominent businessman in return for guaranteeing him a lowered price in a land deal with the state.
