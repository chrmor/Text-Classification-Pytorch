Czech police foil 'attack' on Angela Merkel as suspect tried to ram Chancellor
Armed Czech police fired at a suspect driving a large SUV as it attempted to ram German Chancellor Angela Merkel's motorcade. 
Merkel was on a visit to Prague when the man tried to break through a security cordon forcing local police to act. 
Officers fired at the SUV which stopped. While searching the vehicle, officers recovered handcuffs, tear gas and concrete cubes, according to local media. 
The man was driving a black Mercedes SUV when he tried to attack. 
Police spokesman Jozef Bocan said: '[The man]  attempted to join the motorcade as it moved between Prague airport and Czech government headquarters.' 
Bocan stressed that at no stage had Chancellor Merkel been in any danger. 
He said: 'While attempting to join the motorcade, he tried to run down police securing the road. The suspect acted alone. He was not armed, but items found in the car could easily have been used as weapons, particularly some cement cubes.' 
 Bocan revealed officers had been forced to open fire to subdue the suspect who is now under arrest.  
Merkel held talks Thursday with Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka and President Milos Zeman focused on the future of the European Union after Britain's June decision to leave the bloc.
Several hundred protesters, including members of anti-Islam groups, rallied in central Prague against Merkel and her decision to open the EU's doors to refugees and migrants last summer.
