Forgetful fan leaves Ireland Euro tickets in airport shop
Forgetful Irish football fan Oliver Coughlan is the target of a worldwide web hunt.
He left his tickets for Ireland's three Euro 2012 matches in a Champion Sports shop in Dublin Airport.
"The tickets are for Ireland's games against Croatia, Italy and Spain," said Paul O'Kane at Dublin Airport.
"I can only think that somewhere in Poland, the poor man is putting his hand in his pocket for his tickets and figuring out that they're gone."
The tickets were found in the airport shop at 10:00 BST on Friday.
The authorities think that Mr Coughlan must have flown out without them.
But thanks to the honesty of staff at Champion Sports and the quick thinking of the airport media department, the hunt for Oliver has taken to Twitter and Facebook. His story has featured on Irish radio and on news websites.
His story has gone viral.
"We have tweeted and Champion Sports have posted messages on their Facebook," said Mr O'Kane, director of public affairs at the airport.
"The story has been picked up by RTE and local radio stations.
"I can only think that the first game is on Sunday evening so we have a bit of time to find him. Ten years ago, trying to track him down would have been very difficult. Now, thanks to new media and social networks we have a chance of reuniting him with his tickets before Sunday's match."
The airport lines have been buzzing with people wondering about those tickets - some of them have even offered to buy them.
But the airport is keen to do the right thing by Mr Coughlan - they are trying their best to reunite him with his tickets and have asked the public to help them find him.
