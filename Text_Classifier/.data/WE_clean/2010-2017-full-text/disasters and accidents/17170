At Least 15 Killed in India Building Collapse
Indian rescue workers continue to look for survivors of the collapse of a multi-story building under construction in the southwestern state of Goa. Officials say at least 15 people were killed when the building gave way Saturday in Canacona, about 70 kilometers from the state capital, Panaji. Authorities say another dozen or so may be trapped under the rubble. The India Timesreported Sunday that rescue workers could hear people crying under the debris. Authorities say the army has joined emergency workers in sifting through the rubble for survivors and bodies. Witnesses say up to 40 laborers were working when the building collapsed. The cause is unknown. Police say they are searching for the construction manager and building contractor who have since gone missing. Building collapses are common in India because builders often use substandard materials and multi-story structures are often constructed without adequate supervision.
