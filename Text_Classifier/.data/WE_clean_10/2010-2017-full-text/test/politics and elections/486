Satellite image shows North Korea rocket activity
JAPAN'S defence minister said today he had issued an order to shoot down a North Korean rocket if it falls towards Japanese territory.
North Korea has begun preparing for a long-range rocket launch next month despite international condemnation, according to satellite images published by a US-based website. The images taken yesterday show work to prepare the launch pad appears to be under way, according to the 38 Northwebsite. The website (38north.org), which specialises in analysis of the country, published several images taken by private US firm DigitalGlobe.
An analysis conducted for the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies says the image shows trucks and fuel tanks, and work under way on the gantry next to a mobile launch pad. North Korea says the launch is to fire an observation satellite into orbit. The US says it is a cover to test long-range missile technology.
The communist nation test-fired two short-range missiles off its west coast this week amid international alarm at the planned long-range rocket launch, South Korean newspapers said today.
The North fired what appeared to be two KN-01 ground-to-ship missiles with a range of up to 120 kilometres (75 miles) early yesterday from a missile base near the western port of Nampo, Chosun Ilbo newspaper said.
It quoted an unidentified Seoul government official as saying the launch was apparently aimed at improving the performance of the projectile and was unrelated to the rocket launch scheduled for next month.
The JoongAng Ilbo newspaper carried a similar report but said the launch was on Wednesday. South Korea's defence ministry declined to confirm the reports.
President Barack Obama appealed to North Korean leaders to abandon the rocket plan but was promptly rebuffed. The North insists it will go ahead with what it calls the peaceful launch of a scientific satellite from its Tongchang-ri site in the far northwest. The United States and other nations say the exercise is in breach of UN resolutions and of a US-North Korean deal reached last month. The website said the detailed images show the mobile launch pad sitting on tracks next to the gantry tower. It said a crane atop the tower was at a 45 degree angle relative to the pad, indicating equipment was being loaded onto the gantry, and numerous small objects and people could be sighted on the pad. A work crew appeared to be cutting away brush, possibly to prevent the spread of any fire started by the launch. At the two largest propellant storage buildings to the right of the launch pad, containing tanks to supply the Unha-3 rocket's first stage, trucks could be seen delivering fuel and oxidiser, it said. 38 North said launch pad preparation "seems to be progressing on schedule" and the next step would be the movement of the rocket's first stage to the pad, probably on March 30 or 31. This would be followed by the second stage a day or two later, with the third stage and payload likely following by April 2 or 3. "Unless some major setback occurs, the North Koreans will be able to launch during the declared launch window starting April 12," it said. The North has said it will launch the satellite some time in the morning between April 12-16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of founding president Kim Il-Sung. It says the satellite will estimate crop yields and collect weather data. among other civilian missions, and rejects strong criticism from leaders including US President Barack Obama.
