Tony Smith elected new Speaker following Bronwyn Bishop resignation
Victorian Liberal Tony Smith has been elected by his colleagues to serve as the new Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Mr Smith was nominated as the party room's choice after a meeting of 74 Liberal MPs in Canberra on Monday.
Chief whip Scott Buchholz said Mr Smith had won in an "exhaustive ballot" but he bungled the official announcement by incorrectly naming one of the contenders.
"The final two results come down to Andrew Broadbent and Tony Smith. The victor was Tony Smith, 51-22," he told reporters at Parliament House.
