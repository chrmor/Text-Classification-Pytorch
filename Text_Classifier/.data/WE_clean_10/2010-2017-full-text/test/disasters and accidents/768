Video: New York's unprecedented 2015 blizzard
New York's mayor warned the north east of America could be about to face one of the biggest blizzards in the city's history.
Millions of Americans are bracing themselves for Winter Storm Juno, as snow began falling early Monday across the region.
It is expected to accumulate steadily throughout the day before turning into a major storm expected to paralyze parts of New York and New England.
The National Weather Service said up to three feet of snow could fall from the New York area into coastal New England, with whiteout conditions possible.
Blizzard warnings have been issued from New Jersey to the Canadian border, including New York and Boston. Coastal flood warnings are also in effect.
More than 5,100 flights have been cancelled within, to or from the United States on Monday and Tuesday, according to flightaware.com.
"We are facing most likely one of the largest snow storms in the history of this city," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
"My message to all New Yorkers is to prepare for something worse than we have seen before."
"Take every precaution, now is the time to get ready for this extreme weather," de Blasio said. "Don't underestimate the storm."
Power outages and falling trees are likely during the storm and in its aftermath, meteorologists warned, saying 28 million people were in the possible blizzard zone.

The heaviest snow is likely to be in New England. Thunder and lightning, known as "thundersnow", could also accompany the heavy snow, meteorologists said.
Gusts of wind are forecast to reach up to 55 miles per hour and more than 70 mph in eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard.
Coastal flooding is also a risk in the early hours of Tuesday.
