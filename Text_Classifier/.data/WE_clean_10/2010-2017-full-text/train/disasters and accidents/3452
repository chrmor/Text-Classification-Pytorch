Ten dead after South Korea fishing boat capsizes
At least 10 people have died and eight are missing after a South Korean fishing charter boat capsized.
The 9.8-tonne boat, Dolphin, went missing off the southwest coast near the island of Chuja on Saturday night and its wreckage was found Sunday morning.
A survivor told Yonhap news agency that the boat quickly capsized because of high waves.
The survivor, identified only by the surname Park, awoke to find the captain telling the passengers to get out as the boat filled with water.
