Chancellor Hammond claims UK economic fundamentals are strong despite Brexit fears –as it happened
Ireland’s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy.
Britain is Ireland’s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain’s fifth biggest trading partner with €1.5bn in transactions a week.
The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative for the economy.
It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence.
In a statement Ireland’s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said while the economy’s reliance on the British export market had weakened over recent decades.
Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound.
Among Ireland’s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged medicines while the UK’s exports to Britain including gas, cars and pharmaceuticals.
Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin’s Economic and Social Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada.
