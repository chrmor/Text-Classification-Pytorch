Four British police officers face charges over an alleged attack on a terror suspect they arrested in 2003.
The Crown Prosecution Service says Babar Ahmad suffered a number of injuries during the arrest, including heavy bruising to his head, neck, wrists and feet.
The 36-year-old Muslim man, who was not charged following the south-west London raid, claims officers beat him, dragged him by handcuffs and mocked his faith.
Prosecutors initially said there was not enough evidence to charge anyone, but after Mr Ahmad was paid more than $100,000 by London's Metropolitan Police in a High Court action last year, his lawyers asked prosecutors to review the evidence.
Mr Ahmad is being held in a British prison after the European Court of Human Rights last month blocked his extradition to the United States to face separate terror charges.
