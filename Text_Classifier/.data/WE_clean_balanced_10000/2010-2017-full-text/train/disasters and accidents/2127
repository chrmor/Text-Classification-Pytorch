A new video of the chaotic scene after an Asiana Airlines flight crash landed in San Francisco last year may provide answers for the family of a passenger who survived the crash, but was killed when she was run over during the firefighting effort.
CBS News obtained the video, which was shot by a helmet-mounted camera worn by a firefighter who was on the scene after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed on the runway at San Francisco International Airport on July 6.
The family of Ye Meng Yuan, who survived the crash, but was run over by a firetruck as firefighters battled the blaze, is suing the city of San Francisco. She was one of three victims of the crash; 304 people survived. The video shows a victim, who investigators believe is Ye Meng Yuan, on the ground in front of the plane. One of the firefighters told investigators that he did a visual assessment and believe Ye was dead, but did not check her vitals.
The investigation into the crash is ongoing.
