Greece faces expulsion from Schengen to stop migrant flow in move that would create a 'cemetery of souls'
Greece will have its borders effectively sealed off from the rest of the continent under plans to tackle the migrant crisis, European leaders proposed on Monday night.
The European Commission will consider plans that would see the frontier of the Schengen zone – the area which allows passport-free travel within Europe – moved north to exclude Greece.
The proposal came at a meeting of European leaders on Monday which also agreed to draw up plans to allow internal border checks in Europe for up to two years, effectively suspending the Schengen zone.
There were calls for Greece to set up vast holding camps for 300,000 refugees in an attempt to stem the flow of unchecked migrants from Syria and other nations outside Europe entering the continent.
At the summit in Amsterdam, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, accused her counterparts of doing nothing to stem the crisis that now threatens to tear the EU apart.
Mrs May, a noted Eurosceptic who is being urged to lead the “Leave” campaign, said: “Unfortunately what we’ve had is more talk than action.”
It emerged on Monday that David Cameron has just days left to finalise his renegotiation with other EU nations ahead of a proposed referendum. A draft text – outlining the deal the EU is prepared to offer Britain to remain in the EU – is now due to be published by Donald Tusk, the European Council president, early next week.
The details of the deal – and the concessions within it – will play a key role in determining whether Britain votes to leave the EU in a referendum.
Currently, the migrant crisis is the issue which could prompt voters to decide whether Britain has a future in Europe.
The scramble to save Schengen, Europe’s proudest achievement, risks dominating a summit next month, and any delay in sealing a British deal puts the prospect of a summer referendum in jeopardy.
Athens reacted with fury to the proposal, put forward by Miro Cerar, the Slovenian prime minister, and endorsed by Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, to turn the country into what Greek ministers said was a “cemetery of souls”.
Yannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, denounced the threat of Schengen exclusion as a “blame game”. Greek officials accused the EU of peddling “lies” that it does not want to control its border and said it had not been consulted on the plan.
Nikos Toskas, Athens’ public order minister, said criticisms of Greece were unfair. “It is very difficult to stop small boats coming … except sinking or shooting them, which is against our European values and Greek values and we will not do that,” he said.
Under plans described by diplomats as a “second line of defence”, thousands of police will be deployed on the border between Greece and Macedonia, cutting off a trail used by hundreds of thousands of migrants last year.
It will send “a message that investment in irregular migration is pointless”, said Mr Cerar in a letter. Some 2.6 million people are expected to try to reach Europe in the next two years, with 30,000 arriving this month.
Mr Juncker has sent a team of specialists to inspect the border. He called on EU countries to refuse entry to migrants who could have made asylum applications earlier in their journeys.
Greece has registered just a quarter of the nearly half a million migrants that passed through the country between July and November en route to Germany and Sweden.
Mr Juncker’s spokesman said that states including Greece had agreed before Christmas “that a policy of simply waving people through from one country to the next was not acceptable.”
Theo Francken, the Belgian immigration minister, called for “closed facilities” in Greece to be operated by the EU and to hold up to 300,000 people.
He said “the Greeks now need to bear the consequences” of being unable to stop the migrant flows, adding that the Greek “state structure is just too weak to do it themselves – apparently.”
At the summit in Amsterdam, interior ministers instructed the European Commission to draw up plans to impose internal border controls within the Schengen zone for up to two years.
It is “inevitable” the unprecedented measures will be required when the current six-month period of temporary border checks imposed by Germany and five other states expires in May, the Dutch government said.
“The unprecedented influx of asylum seekers, which compelled member states to take these measures nationally, has not decreased yet,” said Klaas Dijkhoff, the Dutch justice minister, who chaired the meeting.
He said the Commission had been asked to “prepare the legal and practical basis” to activate emergency measures that suspend Schengen rules for up to two years in the case of “serious persistent deficiencies” in the external border.
Mr Tusk will next week table a draft of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation proposals which will be discussed at a Brussels summit in February. At a joint Downing Street press conference with Enda Kenny, the Irish Taoiseach, Mr Cameron said he was still pressing for negotiations to conclude in February and said that “if there’s a good deal on the table I’ll take it”.

He said: “We should be focusing on the positive opportunity for Britain. Imagine the scale of the prize if we can remain a member of the single market – with 500 million consumers, a quarter of the global economy – with a seat at the table, a say over the rules, making sure we do right for business, jobs and investment in the UK combined with action to make sure we deal with the things that frustrate people about the EU.”
Mr Kenny said that there were still “complications” with the proposals but insisted that they are “solvable”.
Child asylum seekers who arrive in Britain alone should be distributed across the country because a massive influx threatens to overwhelm one local authority, it was warned last night.
A county councillor in Kent said vulnerable British children in care have had to move away from their home area because of a sharp rise in young asylum seekers arriving from Calais.
Peter Oakford, who oversees specialist children’s services in Kent, said the problem could intensify if – as Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary has indicated – the Government agrees to take 3,000 extra child refugees from Europe.
Mr Cameron spoke to Angela Merkel on Monday night, the German Chancellor, and agreed that there is "more work to do" on Britian's EU renegotiation demands ahead of the Brussels summit in February.
They also agreed that strong European borders and close cooperation with Turkey is "vital" to tackling the migrant crisis.
