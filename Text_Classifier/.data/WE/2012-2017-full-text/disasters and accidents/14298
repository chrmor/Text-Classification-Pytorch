In pictures: Haze on Sep 14
The 24-hour PSI has hovered in the Unhealthy range throughout Monday, on the first day of school after the term break.
SINGAPORE: The 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) stayed in the Unhealthy range on Monday (Sep 14), with hazy conditions expected to persist into Tuesday.
Many followers on Channel NewsAsia's social media could not believe the PSI figures being reported by the National Environment Agency (NEA), adding that the real figure should be much higher.
Twitter user @curlie_bro said the Marina Bay Financial Centre could not even be seen through the thick smog.
Over at Telok Blangah, Facebook user Eric Zhuo sent two photos, which he said showed a "stark difference" because of the hazy conditions.
The haze also covered Cantonment Road, according to Facebook user Lorbin Ho, who sent a picture she took from the Pinnacle@Duxton. She said "a wave of hazy particles have been covering the city landscape, and it's getting worse and worse".
Tina Ruth Dias, who also sent in a photo at about 6pm, said the sun was completely hidden.
Many in downtown Singapore also resorted to wearing face masks to alleviate the burning smell and ease breathing difficulties, Channel NewsAsia's Ngau Kai Yan reported.
Dee M Ismail, who sent a photo from his home in Jurong West, said the situation got worse, even after some light rain. He added that there is now a "burning smell everywhere".
Serene Tan said it was raining in Balestier, but it was barely noticeable due to the haze. She also noted the "strong burning smell in the air".
For the rest of Monday and into Tuesday, "the prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the southwest and the current hazy conditions are expected to persist", said NEA.
"The haze situation could further deteriorate should the current unfavourable winds blow in denser haze from Sumatra," it added.
