'Beginning of end' for Colombian rebels
President Juan Manuel Santos has proclaimed "the beginning of the end" of Colombia's main guerilla group as he overflew the secret camp where the rebels' second in command was killed.
Some 800 ground troops supported by helicopters and warplanes stormed the camp early on Wednesday in an attack, dubbed "Operation Sodom."
The body of Jorge Briceno Suarez, the feared military commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) known as "Mono Jojoy," was found the following day when soldiers entered the camp.
Rebels killed in the attack included three senior guerrilla leaders -- a member of the FARC directorate, a regional military commander, and the head of the group's urban militias, according to the military.
"With a good margin of confidence we can say that this is the beginning of the end for the FARC," Santos said after overflying the bombed-out camp, located in the Meta province some 700km south of Bogota.
The attack was a serious blow to the 46 year-old leftist insurgency, which has suffered the death of several top leaders since March 2008, when troops killed FARC's then second-in-command Raul Reyes.
