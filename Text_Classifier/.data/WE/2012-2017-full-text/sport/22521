Belgium finished third, beating Greece 78-45, to earn the country's first bronze medal ever in the tournament. Turkey topped Latvia 72-63 for the final two spots. It will be the first time that Latvia will ever compete in the world cup. Latvia reached the fifth-place game with a wild one-point win over Italy in the consolation semifinals.
