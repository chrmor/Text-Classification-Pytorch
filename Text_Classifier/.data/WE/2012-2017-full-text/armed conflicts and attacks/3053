Alleged advisor in Mexican drug cartel is extradited to U.S.
SAN DIEGO â€” Eduardo Arellano Felix, one of a band of brothers who headed what was once Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking organization, was extradited to the U.S. on Friday, capping a 20-year effort to bring the siblings to justice in federal court.
Arellano Felix, 55, a onetime medical student nicknamed "El Doctor," was allegedly a key advisor in the Arellano Felix drug cartel, which during its heyday in the 1980s and '90s pumped tons of drugs into the U.S. and murdered hundreds while defending their turf in Baja California.
Arrested after a shootout in Tijuana in 2008, Arellano Felix exhausted all of his appeals in Mexico and was flown to San Diego on Friday afternoon. He is the last of the brothers named in the 2003 racketeering indictment to be extradited.
The investigation targeting the organization, also known as the Tijuana drug cartel, spanned decades and was spearheaded by a Drug Enforcement Administration-led task force in San Diego. Agents greeted the handcuffed, balding kingpin upon his arrival in San Diego.
