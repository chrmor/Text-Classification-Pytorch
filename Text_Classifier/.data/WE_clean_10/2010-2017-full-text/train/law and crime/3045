Oakland, NYC occupiers see violence, legal action
"The most current field reports confirm that in the port area there were no injuries, no property damage, and no major security problems from last night's demonstrations," port officials said. "There was a limited incursion into a private rail facility, and trespassers were escorted off peacefully."
Just about every office building and store within a block of City Hall had been vandalized with spray-painted graffiti or broken windows from the overnight violence -- which many of the Occupy demonstrators said was committed by a radical fringe of the movement.
Of the 78 demonstrators, 53 indicated they wanted to go trial, and nine accepted an "adjournment in contemplation of dismissal," in which charges would be dismissed after six month if they aren't arrested again, the spokeswoman said. One case was dismissed, and another case, a misdemeanor, was continued, the prosecutor's office said.
"It is very simple: I don't feel like I need to be on probation for six months for expressing my right to freedom of speech," Hall said. "I plead not guilty because I was on the sidewalk expressing my constitutionally protected right to dissent."
Attorney Martin R. Stolar, a member of the National Lawyers Guild, which is supporting the Occupy protesters, said many demonstrators were arrested even after heeding police directions to stay on the sidewalk. He said the judge should throw out all the cases.
"I'm pleased that people recognized the fact that they don't want to be on some form of probation, that they want to continue to engage in protest activity -- not civil disobedience but protest activity," Stolar said.
"At least 10 officers (nine officers and one sergeant) were physically assaulted while facilitating the removal of the arrested suspects from the scene," Seattle police said in an official blog.
