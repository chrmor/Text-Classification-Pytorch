Afghanistan earthquake: Strong tremor felt in Kabul, Pakistan, India
The strong earthquake, which struck at 11:45 p.m. Afghanistan time, was centered 283 kilometers (176 miles) northeast of Kabul, not far from the border with Tajikistan. It struck about 203 kilometers (126 miles) deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake, because of its strength and depth, was felt over a large area, with witnesses reporting feeling the tremors as far away as the capital Kabul, parts of Pakistan, and India's Haryana-Uttar Pradesh Region. It was also felt in Tajikistan. The earthquake prompted many people in Kabul to flee out onto the street, and residents said parts of the capital were without power. Journalist Bilal Sarwary reported that at least 5 people in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province were being treated for injuries, and all hospitals have been put on standby. In Pakistan, the earthquake was also felt across many parts of the country, including Islamabad, Lahore, and Abbottabad. Residents in various cities evacuated buildings, and a red alert has been issued for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the area of the capital Karachi.
