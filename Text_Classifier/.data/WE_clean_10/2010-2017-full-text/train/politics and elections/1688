Kremlin to Putin - start board cleanup by July 1
MOSCOW, April 2 (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to “initiate” the removal of his deputies and ministers from the board of state companies by July 1, the Kremlin said on Saturday.
The officials for removal from state company boards included Putin Deputy Igor Sechin, the powerful chairman of the country’s top oil producer, state controlled Rosneft (ROSN.MM), who presided over its landmark Arctic drilling and share swap deal with BP.
The list was published on the Kremlin website (www.kremlin.ru) as an appendix to Medvedev’s order.
Russian companies hold their annual meetings by the end of June.
