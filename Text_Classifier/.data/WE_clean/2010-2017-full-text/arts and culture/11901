Unification Church founder in 'critical condition'
By Yun Suh-young Rev. Moon Sun-myung, the founder of the Unification Church, is gravely ill according to a hospital official. Moon, 92, is currently in intensive care at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital in Seocho, southern Seoul, with respiratory problems, the official said Wednesday. Rev. Moon was admitted to the intensive care unit at the hospital, Monday, the official said on condition of anonymity. The official said Moon’s family is taking care of him at the hospital. He has apparently developed complications caused by a cold and pneumonia. Tongil Group, a corporation founded by Moon, was unable to confirm the exact state of its founder’s condition except that he was in “critical condition.” Despite his old age, Moon had been active in participating in evangelization work between Korea and the United States, according to the group. He delivered the opening speech at the Peace Cup held in July and presented awards to the winners. In an effort to unite Christianity, he founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in 1954. However, he faced persecution from Christian figures in Korea. In 1994, he founded the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification. He established the Washington Times in the U.S. in 1982 and The Segye Times in Korea in 1989.
