Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Nominated to Be Turkey’s Next Premier
ANKARA, Turkey — The Justice and Development Party, which has ruled Turkey for more than a decade, nominated the foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, on Thursday to succeed President-elect Recep Tayyip Erdogan as prime minister and party chairman.
Mr. Erdogan delivered the announcement after a three-hour meeting with the party’s executive board in Ankara. Mr. Davutoglu’s name was received with applause, and his nomination will go to a vote at a party congress on Wednesday where it is expected to go unchallenged.
“We have consulted with everyone from the people on the street to the highest bodies of our party,” Mr. Erdogan said in making the announcement. “We have come to a point of peace and brotherhood, and the unity of this movement is about everything. Those who want to sow seeds of discord will not succeed.”
Mr. Davutoglu, 55, has long been expected to take over the reins of the party, known as the A.K.P. He is a longtime ally of Mr. Erdogan, having previously served as his chief adviser, and he has overseen the country’s foreign affairs for five years.
