Saudi Arabia make Asian Cup exit
Three-time champions Saudia Arabia lost 1-0 to Jordan to complete a humiliating early exit from the Asian Cup.
It was another disappointing display by the Saudis as they failed to show any improvement under Nasser Al Johar, their new coach brought in to replace Jose Peseiro, who was sacked following the opening match defeat by Syria.
Despite dominating the first half, Saudi Arabia went behind in the 42nd minute when goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah allowed Jordan's Baha' Abdelrahman's deep cross from the left to float over his head and into the corner of the net.
However, the goalkeeper ensured that the Saudi side went in at the break with only a one-goal deficit when he saved at the feet of the dangerous Odai Al Safy.
And Saudi Arabia improved after the break, roared on by their passionate supporters, but struggled to find a breakthrough with their captain Yasser Al Qahtani unable to get into the game.
Nassir Alshamrani, Saudi substitute, had a good chance to equalise for his side in the 76th minute, but Amer Shafi, Jordan's goalkeeper, was out quickly to smother his shot. Osama Al Harbi then headed narrowly over in injury time.
The Saudis steered the ball forward time and again, but despite missing injured captain Hatem Aqel from its defence, Jordan held out to record a famous win over a team ranked fifth in the Asian Confederation.
The result was greeted by a chorus of boos from angry Saudi supporters as the 107th ranked Jordan team ran to their fans to celebrate.
Meanwhile, Jordan's win, which follows an opening draw with Japan, leaves them with a good chance to match their quarter-final run on debut in 2004.
"We didn't fail," Al Johar said. "The Jordan team played defensive throughout the game and we could not reach the goal to score. We were unlucky."
