7 Killed, 2 in Critical Condition After Indonesian Volcano Explodes
The death toll in the eruption of Mount Sinabung rose to seven Sunday with two people still in critical condition, as officials warned of more explosions.
Nata Nail, also a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, told AP that a man died at a hospital Sunday, leaving two other people in critical condition. The bodies of six other victims have been found near the mountain.
All of the victims of the eruption were working on their farms in the village of Gamber in Simpang Empat subdistrict, 2.5 miles away from the slope but still within the danger area, the Associated Press reports. 
This area is referred to as the “red zone,” and has been declared off-limits by government authorities for safety reasons, reports the Bangkok Post. Despite repeated warnings and government efforts to deter people from farming there, some still return to the area.
“This area should have been empty because nobody should be inside the red zone,” Nugroho told the Post. He warned of more potential eruptions, with volcanic activity still high at the mountain.
Photos taken on Sunday showed evidence of pyroclastic flows in the village. Dead and injured animals were lying on the ground amongst scorched homes and smoky vegetation. 
Search operations around the area were halted after officials found there were no more victims or villagers inside the danger zone, Nail told AP.
Mount Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.
