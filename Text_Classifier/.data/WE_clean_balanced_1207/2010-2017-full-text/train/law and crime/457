PNG deputy PM agrees to turn himself in
PAPUA New Guinea's deputy prime minister and the attorney-general have agreed to turn themselves in to police.
Police spokesman Superintendent Dominic Kakas said today that Deputy PM Belden Namah and Attorney-General Allan Marat would hand themselves over soon.
"Both parties have reached an understanding," Mr Kakas said.
"I can say it will happen in the coming days."
An arrest warrant was issued by the Supreme Court on Friday, the day after Mr Namah announced the suspension of Chief Justice Sir Salamo Injia, pending an investigation into multiple charges of financial misconduct.
Sir Salamo is also overseeing Supreme Court hearings into the constitutional legitimacy of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's government, which gained power in a surprise 70-24 vote in parliament on August 2.
The verdict on that case, brought by supporters of dumped former PM Sir Michael Somare, is due on December 9.
Yesterday, a seemingly defiant Mr Namah told reporters in Port Moresby he had received the court order for his arrest for contempt of court, but was awaiting instructions from his lawyers.
Sitting with members of the executive council who voted to suspend the chief justice, he defended that decision.
He said the allegations against Sir Salamo stretched back to 2009 and had nothing to do with the hearings, which rose in early November for a decision on December 9.
"If we had done it last month, or the month before, the Chief Justice was sitting then and hearing the case."
Mr O'Neill is in Hawaii for the APEC Summit and is not expected back home until November 15.
Yesterday, he issued a statement denying the sacking of Sir Salamo had anything to do with the pending court verdict.
Comment was being sought from Mr Namah and Dr Marat.
