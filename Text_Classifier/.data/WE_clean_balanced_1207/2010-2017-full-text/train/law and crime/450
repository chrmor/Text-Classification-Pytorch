Private investigator at centre of phone-hacking row apologises
In a statement released to the Guardian, Glenn Mulcaire said he had worked under ''relentless pressure'' at the Sunday newspaper and there was a ''constant demand for results''.
He said: ''I want to apologise to anybody who was hurt or upset by what I have done.''
Mulcaire issued the statement after allegations emerged yesterday that he illegally accessed the voicemail messages of schoolgirl Milly Dowler in the days after she went missing.
Milly was abducted by Levi Bellfield as she walked home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.
But some voicemail messages on her phone were allegedly deleted by people working for the News of the World, giving Molly's parents Bob and Sally Dowler false hope that their daughter was still alive.
Mulcaire, who made no direct reference to the hacking of her phone, said he had never intended to interfere with any police inquiry.
He said: "I want to apologise to anybody who was hurt or upset by what I have done. I've been to court. I've pleaded guilty. And I've gone to prison and been punished. I still face the possibility of further criminal prosecution.
"Working for the News of the World was never easy. There was relentless pressure. There was a constant demand for results."
Mulcaire and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were given jail terms in January 2007 after the Old Bailey heard they plotted to hack into royal aides' telephone messages.
