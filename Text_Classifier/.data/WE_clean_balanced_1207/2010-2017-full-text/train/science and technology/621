Apple App Store downloads top 25B; customer in China wins $10K
With each major milestone in its App Store, Apple hands out some serious cash. And this time is no different.
After announcing that the App Store reached 25 billion downloads over the weekend, Apple today said that it has awarded Chunli Fu of Qingdao, China a $10,000 iTunes Gift Card for downloading the app that put the marketplace over the mark. According to Apple, Fu downloaded Where's My Water? Free, a Disney game.
Apple has given out $10,000 gift cards in the past, including last January when its store hit 10 billion downloads. Although a gift card is nice, the latest prizes haven't come close to matching what Apple handed out for the one billionth download. That time, 13-year-old Connor Mulcahey was given an iPod Touch, a MacBook Pro, and a Time Capsule, in addition to a $10,000 iTunes gift card.
Apple announced that its store hit 25 billion downloads on Saturday.
