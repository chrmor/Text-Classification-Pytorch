Dan Martin holds off Joaquim Rodríguez to win the Volta a Catalunya
Martin becomes only second Irishman to win the race Sir Bradley Wiggins slips back to fifth overall
Dan Martin of Garmin-Sharp became only the second Irishman – after Sean Kelly, in 1984 and 1986 – to win the Volta a Catalunya.
The final stage around the Alt de Montjuic in Barcelona was won in a sprint by Belgium's Thomas de Gendt of Vacansoleil from Team Sky's David López at the head of a four-strong breakaway group that included Michele Scarponi of Lampre, who had started the day in fifth place, 55 seconds back.
Martin, 26 and the nephew of Stephen Roche, shadowed his closest rival for the overall win, Joaquim Rodríguez, throughout the final stage to protect his 17-second advantage.
After finishing in the breakaway, Scarponi leapfrogged Sir Bradley Wiggins in the general classification to finish third, pushing the Tour de France winner back into fifth place, 54 seconds behind Martin.
