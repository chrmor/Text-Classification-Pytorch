Paris Attacks: At Least 2 Dead, 8 Arrested During Saint-Denis Raid
SAINT-DENIS, France — French police hunting the suspected ringleader behind the Paris massacre raided another terrorist cell Wednesday which was plotting a new strike — but the fate of the man being sought was unclear.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at least two suspected terrorists — a man and a woman — were killed, and eight more were arrested in the early morning raid on an apartment in the suburb of Saint-Denis.
Neither Belgian jihadi Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who is believed to have played a key planning role in the assault on Paris, nor fugitive suspected accomplice Salah Abdeslam are among those who were arrested, the prosecutor said.
Molins said the dead "have not been formally identified."
"I can say Abaaoud and Salah A. are not among those in custody," the prosecutor said.
NBC News could not immediately confirm a report in The Washington Post saying Abaaoud had been killed in the raid.
Molins said the raid was the result of information that a building might contain a possible hideaway of Abaaoud in a third-floor apartment.
