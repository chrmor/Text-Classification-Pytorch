Two militants killed in Yemen 'drone strike'
Two militants have been killed in a suspected US drone strike in southern Yemen, officials and witnesses say.
Two other militants were reportedly wounded when the vehicle in which they were travelling was destroyed near al-Askariya in Lahij province.
Local officials said the targets were believed to have been members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
It is thought to have been the ninth US drone strike in Yemen since 27 July. They have left 38 militants dead.
Five were killed in a strike in the eastern province of Hadramawt on Friday, while two strikes in Hadramawt and Marib on Thursday killed eight.
The US acknowledges using drones in Yemen, but does not comment on individual strikes.
The US embassy in Yemen has been closed for the past week because of "ongoing concerns" about possible attacks by AQAP. Eighteen other US missions in the Middle East and North Africa will reopen on Sunday.
On Wednesday, the Yemeni authorities said they had foiled a AQAP plot to seize major oil and gas terminals and blow up pipelines.
