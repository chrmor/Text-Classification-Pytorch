Howard Jacobson wins Man Booker Prize
British author and broadcaster Howard Jacobson has edged out the favourites to win the Man Booker Prize for Fiction, scooping the £50,000 literary prize for his novel, The Finkler Question. It is the first comic novel to win the award in its 42-year history.
A high-spirited Jacobson, who has taught at the University of Sydney, accepted the award at Guildhall in central London and told journalists: "I have been waiting for this for a long time … I was starting to look like the novelist that never ever won the Booker Prize."
Jacobson has been longlisted twice: in 2006 for Kalooki Nightsand in 2002 for Who's Sorry Now, but has never before been shortlisted.

He admitted to experiencing some bitterness at being repeatedly passed over but joked that "being shortlisted felt like an embrace … It has now been consummated".
