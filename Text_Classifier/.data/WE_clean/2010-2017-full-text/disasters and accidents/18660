NEW DELHI: Four people have been killed after Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express derailed near Chhapra in Bihar early on Wednesday morning. According to reports, 11 coaches of train number 12236 have derailed. Railways, while confirming the death of 4 people in the accident, has not ruled out sabotage in view of a shutdown call by Maoists in the area. Relief and rescue operations are on in full swing at the accident site. Relief train is taking the stranded passengers to the nearest station. Railway minister Sadanada Gowda expressed grief over the loss of lives in the mishap. He directed the railway administration to render best possible treatment to the injured passengers. Railway minister announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the family of the dead, Rs 1 lakh for those seriously injured and Rs 20,000 for those with minor injuries. "Commissioner of railway safety will conduct an independent inquiry to find out the cause of the accident," the railway minister said. Railway Board chairman Arunendra Kumar said sabotage seems to be the prima facie cause of the accident. Chhapra MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy reached the accident site and took stock of the relief efforts. "It is too early to comment on role of Maoists. Only a proper investigation will reveal the truth." Rudy said when asked about possibility of sabotage. Earlier, DIG Saran Vinod Kumar also confirmed four deaths speaking to NDTV. "The accident happened soon after the train left Chhapra station around 2am," the DIG said. "Around 8 to 10 people have been injured in the accident," Vinod Kumar told the channel. The DIG had ruled out sabotage. "The driver said he heard no sound of explosion. The train stopped after some noise on the tracks," he said. Railway officials said that the line will be restored by evening.
