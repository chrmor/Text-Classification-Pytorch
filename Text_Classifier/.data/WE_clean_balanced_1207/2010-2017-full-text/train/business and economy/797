Stocks Rise as Buffett Eyes M&A; Oil Falls, Dollar Index Drops
U.S. stocks rallied, extending a third monthly gain, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he’s looking to make acquisitions and reports signaled a strengthening American economy. Oil retreated as Saudi Arabia offered to make up for lost output in Libya. The dollar slid.
The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent to 1,327.22 at 4 p.m. in New York and rose 3.2 percent in February. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent.

The S&P 500 rebounded after last week’s 1.7 percent drop after Buffett told shareholders his “trigger finger is itchy” for deals, spurring speculation that an upswing in takeovers will accelerate.

“It’s a constructive environment,” said Mike Ryan, the New York-based head of wealth management research for the Americas at UBS Financial Services Inc., which oversees about $741 billion. “Whenever Warren Buffett’s talking about putting money to work, that’s going to have a positive impact on people’s views and on the market.”
Buffett isn’t the only investor with an itchy trigger finger. Announced takeovers of U.S. companies have totaled $161.9 billion so far in 2011, 66 percent more than the $97.4 billion through this date last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Stocks also gained as the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today its business barometer rose to 71.2 this month, the highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in January. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion. The gauge, which was projected to fall, exceeded every estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Separate government data showed personal incomes climbed 1 percent and inflation remained below the Fed’s long-term forecast.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said in a speech in New York that the “considerably brighter” economic outlook isn’t yet reason for the central bank to withdraw its record monetary stimulus.
