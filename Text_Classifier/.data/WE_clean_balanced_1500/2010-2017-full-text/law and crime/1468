Congregation of vandalized Ohio church pray for suspect
PIQUA, Ohio (AP) - The congregation of a vandalized western Ohio church held its Sunday services outdoors and prayed for the man charged in the incident.
The Dayton Daily News reports (https://bit.ly/1VW5usE ) 29-year-old Dustin Connor was charged with felony breaking and entering, theft and vandalism in connection with damage sustained at Snyder Road Church of God in Piqua last week.
Police say Connor stole a laptop computer, discharged six fire extinguishers and caused damage to a large cross and other parts of the church.
Services were held under a maple tree on church grounds due to the extensive damage to the building. Pastor Richard Keeran estimates the cleanup will take four to eight weeks.
Police say Connor is a person of interest in a similar act of vandalism at the Victory Baptist Church in Piqua.
