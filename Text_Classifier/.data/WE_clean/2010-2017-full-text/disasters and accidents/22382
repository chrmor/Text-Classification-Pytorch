At least eight people have been killed after heavy flooding and a landslide hit north-eastern Turkey, according to officials.
The flooding in the Black Sea province of Artvin was caused by torrential rainfall.

Artvin's governor, Kemal Cirit, told local media that three people died after a house collapsed.
He added that two people are still missing but the heavy rain is expected to ease off over Monday night.
Artvin is known for its high levels of rainfall and floods are a regular occurrence.
