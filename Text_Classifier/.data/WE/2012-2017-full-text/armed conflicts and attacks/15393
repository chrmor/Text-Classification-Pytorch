Mali hotel attack: Gunmen shot  'at anything that moved'
(CNN)Gunmen who raided a Malian hotel shouted "Allahu akbar" as they sprayed bullets on tables of people who were gathered for breakfast, a witness said.
The attackers did not say a word to anyone as they opened fire Friday morning, employee Tamba Couye said.
They shot at "anything that moved" as terrified patrons dashed for cover all over the hotel, he said.
By the time Malian and U.N. security forces rushed in and ended the siege hours later, bodies were scattered across the floors of the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako.
At least 22 people were killed in the attack, the U.N. mission in Mali said in a statement Sunday.
"They started firing at the tables," he said. "They walked through the hotel door and started to shoot at everybody. Then they returned to the restaurant and closed its doors."
Kathie Fazekas was getting ready to check out of the hotel when the attack began. As gunshots went off, the American specialist for the Centers for Disease Control barricaded herself inside a room and wrote her husband an email.
"There are shooters down the hallway," she told him, "and I want you to know that if I don't make it, that I love you and my family and my CDC. But I am coming home."
And U.S. citizen Anita Datar died in the attacks, her brother Sanjeev Datar said. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton -- who had Datar's former partner as one of her senior policy advisers when she was in the Senate -- remembered her as "the loving mother of a wonderful 7-year-old boy" and "a bright light who gave help and hope to people in need around the world."
"We are devastated," said Michaelle Jean, secretary-general of La Francophonie, an organization planning events on diversity and cultural expression as well as governance at the Bamako hotel. "We salute [Dieudonne's] courage, strength of conviction [and] determination."
