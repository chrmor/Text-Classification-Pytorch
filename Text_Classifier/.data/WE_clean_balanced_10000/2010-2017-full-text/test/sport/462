Posted at | Updated as of
MANILA, Philippines -- Indonesia has failed to score the necessary aggregate points in the second leg of their finals duel, allowing Malaysia to win the 2010 ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Suzuki Cup on Wednesday.
Indonesia actually outscored Malaysia in their second finals match at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, 2-1.
The effort made by the Indonesian booters, however, was not enough to overcome the 3 point advantage erected by Malaysia in the first leg.
Malaysia won the finals series with a total aggregate scores of 4-2 over Indonesia.
Malaysia defeated erstwhile champion Vietnam in the semis to make it into the championship round.
Indonesia, on the other hand, disposed of the Philippine Azkals in the other semifinal duel to forge a finals meeting with Malaysia.
