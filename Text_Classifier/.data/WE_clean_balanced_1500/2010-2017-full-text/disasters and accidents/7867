Death toll of the Sinai Bus accident increases to 44: South Sinai Prosecution
South Sinai prosecution said on Saturday that casualties from the Sinai bus accident increased from 38 to 44.
Early Friday morning two buses collided resulting in the deaths of 38 passengers on Friday and the injury of 41 others.
Burial certificates have been issued for all casualties.
The prosecution said on Saturday that they were able to recognise all unidentified bodies and body parts of the 44 deceased.
Later on Friday, South Sinai prosecutor, Mohamed Abdel-Salam, ordered the detainment of the two bus drivers for questioning.
The prosecution plans to question the injured drivers and conduct a drug test once their condition is stable.
A team from the prosecution also went to Sharm El-Sheikh International Hospital and El-Tor General Hospital, where the injured were transferred, to hear their testimonies.
The road was closed for three hours to facilitate access for ambulances.
A team from South Sinai’s prosecution was sent to the scene to investigate the cause of the accident. The prosecution also sent a technical team to examine the buses and determine their speed at the time of the collision.
The governor of South Sinai Khaled Fouda stressed that El-Tor international road meets international standards.
However, an anonymous source in the South Sinai governorate told Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website that El-Tor International road, which starts from the Ahmed Hamdy tunnel, links the two banks of Suez Canal and extends to Sharm El-Sheikh, lacks radar services.
Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said on Saturday that the accident resulted from a "human error".
Drivers will be attending training programs soon to reduce the number of road accidents, added Mahlab, stressing that decisions will be taken to increase the number of drivers travelling on long freeways.
