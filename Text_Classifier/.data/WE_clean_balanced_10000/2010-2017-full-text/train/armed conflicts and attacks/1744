Jihadist rebels surrender Lebanese border points to Syrian Army
BEIRUT, LEBANON (2:00 A.M.) – The jihadist rebels have agreed to surrender the remaining villages between the Lebanese border and Wadi Barada area after a successful meeting with a reconciliation committee sent by the government.
At least 250 jihadist rebels will leave the town of Serghaya and its nearby villages in exchange for transportation to the Idlib Governorate, a government spokesperson told Al-Masdar News on Monday night.
In addition to surrendering this town, the jihadist rebels will also give-up the Rankous area and its border-crossing in the Qalamoun Mountains; this will result in the Syrian Army’s full control over the rural Zabadani border with Lebanon.
The surrender of this area by the jihadist rebels is a major for victory for the Syrian government forces, as they will now free up more than 5,000 soldiers.
