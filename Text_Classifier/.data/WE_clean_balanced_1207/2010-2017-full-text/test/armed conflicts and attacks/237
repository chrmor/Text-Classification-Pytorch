Final Bloody Sunday commemoration march to take place
The final anniversary march marking the Bloody Sunday killings is to take place in Derry this afternoon.
Organisers say the annual commemoration will not be held again as it is no longer necessary after the Saville Report exonerated the dead and wounded.
None of the soldiers involved have been charged in connection with the killings.
