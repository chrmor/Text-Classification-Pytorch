Airlines re-route flights to avoid North Korea rocket
Several airlines will re-route flights over the Philippines to avoid a rocket North Korea is expected to launch between this and next week, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines says.
About 20 flights including Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Korean Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Delta Airlines will be re-routed between Thursday and Monday, when North Korea says it will launch a satellite. The exact timing depends on weather.
Floramel Joy Songsong, spokeswoman for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, said the agency will temporarily close three northeastern air corridors, which will result in an additional 20 minutes of travel time for the airlines.
Japanese carriers JAL and ANA will change flight paths on routes connecting Tokyo to Manila, Jakarta and Singapore, while domestic flights will not be affected.
JAL has four flights a day on the expected rocket launch dates. Airline official Norio Higashimine said each flight will carry more fuel in case of an unexpected route change.
