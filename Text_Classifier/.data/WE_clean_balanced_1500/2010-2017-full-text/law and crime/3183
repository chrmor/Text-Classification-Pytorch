Louisiana Enacts Hate Crimes Law to Protect a New Group: Police
Hate crime statutes originated as a response to bigotry, a special penalty for singling people out for abuse based on factors like race, ethnicity, sex, religion, sexual orientation or, most recently, gender identity. On Thursday, Louisiana became the first state to add law enforcement officers to that list.
A bill signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards on Thursday set off a debate over whether the measure was really needed to protect officers, or whether, as civil rights groups charged, it was an effort to dilute the basic meaning of hate crimes and to undermine the movement protesting the use of force by the police. A similar bill is pending in Congress.
The action comes at a time of fierce national debate over policing and race. The high-profile deaths of African-Americans at the hands of the police — from Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., to Eric Garner in New York City — have prompted intense criticism of law enforcement. That criticism has come in street demonstrations and on social media, spawning the Black Lives Matter movement. Some law enforcement groups have charged that those protests have led to an increase in attacks on police officers, though there is little data to support that. Still, some supporters of law enforcement have adopted the slogan, “Blue Lives Matter.”
“I’ve read various accounts of people who I would say were employing a deliberate campaign to terrorize our officers,” said State Representative Lance Harris, a Republican and the author of the Louisiana measure. “I just wanted to give an extra level of protection to the people who protect us.”
