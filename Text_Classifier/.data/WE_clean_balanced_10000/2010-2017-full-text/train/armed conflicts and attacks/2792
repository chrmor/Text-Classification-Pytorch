Crowds attack diplomatic missions in Syria-residents
AMMAN, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Crowds armed with sticks and knives attacked the Saudi embassy in Damascus and the French and Turkish consulates in the city of Latakia on Saturday after the Arab League suspended Syria, residents said.
A diplomatic source in Damascus confirmed the attacks, which took place hours after the Syrian suspension by the Arab League to condemn an eight-month crackdown by President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s security forces on pro-democracy demonstrations.
