ISIS Truck Bombs Kill at Least 50 in Tel Tamer, Syria
Kurdish fighters have advanced against the militants in the last few weeks in Hasaka, notably taking over the town of al Houl.
The three blasts, carried out by at least two suicide bombers, struck outside a hospital, at a market and in a residential area in the town of Tel Tamer late on Thursday, the YPG's Redur Xelil said via an Internet messaging service.
"There is massive destruction in the town and the number killed is between 50 and 60, all of them civilians," he said.
ISIS later said in an online statement that three of its fighters driving three separate vehicles had detonated the suicide bombs targeting "bases" belonging to Kurdish fighters.
