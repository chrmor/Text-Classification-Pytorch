Somali police raid house, seize weapons and detonators
(CNN) -- Somali police raided a house in Mogadishu and confiscated weapons, including fuses, explosives and electronic detonators, authorities said Friday.
Other items seized Thursday included chemicals, bombs and suicide belts, the ministry of information said in a statement.
They were designed to be used in terror attacks, authorities said.
The raid was conducted after a tip from residents, police said, adding that no one was present at the house.
"The explosives are believed to have been destined to make crude roadside and suicide bombs, the weapon of choice for Al-Shabaab against civilians and soldiers," said Gen. Ali Mohamed Hassan, the police commissioner.
The raid comes after a U.N. envoy warned that Islamist rebels are a rising threat in the nation and urged an increase in peacekeeping troops in the coming months.
Augustine Mahiga told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that troop levels should be more than tripled to 20,000.
Additional troops, he said, will help fight the Islamist rebels who have been battling peacekeeping troops and government forces.
The United States considers Al-Shabaab, which is al Qaeda's proxy in the country, a terrorist organization.
