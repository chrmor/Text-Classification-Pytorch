Israel Approves Tougher Laws to Combat Stone Throwers
Lawmakers also implemented a minimum sentence of four years for adults found guilty of launching the deadly projectiles. Suspects also face increased fines.
"We intend to change the established norm here â€” the fact that in Israel one can throw objects that are deadly and murderous unanswered and without thwarting," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the cabinet meeting. "That will change."
Netanyahu declared "war" on stone-throwing following the death of an Israeli man in an attack earlier this month. Israeli police said the man's vehicle fatally crashed after it was hit by a rock, thrown by Arabs, in the Jerusalem area on Sept. 15.
Israel has previously changed its criminal code regarding stone-throwing, approving prison sentences of up to 20 years for people who propel rocks at vehicles.
