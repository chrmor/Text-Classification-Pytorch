Super Typhoon Chaba Recap
Chaba intensified to a super typhoon for a time on Oct. 3. The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated maximum sustained winds had reached 145 knots, roughly 165 mph, the equivalent of a Category 5 tropical cyclone at that time.
Wind gusts up to 134 mph (59.7 meters per second) were clocked on the Japanese island of Kume as the eastern eyewall passed through late Monday night, local time.
Chaba is only the third Category 5 equivalent super typhoon to track within 65 nautical miles of Kume Island, in records dating to the 1960s, and is the strongest on record, there.
The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated central pressure had cratered at roughly 905 millibars, a "violent" typhoon by their classification.
A final jog of the eyewall westward spared Okinawa Island, home of the U.S. Kadena Air Base, from the eyewall of this violent super typhoon. Winds gusted over 50 mph on Monday, there.
Chaba also brought heavy rain and strong winds as it passed near southern South Korea while weakening.
Flooding was reported in Gyeongju, South Korea. Sogwipo, South Korea, saw nearly a foot of rain in 24 hours from Chaba.
