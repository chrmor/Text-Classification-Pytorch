USAA Switching Credit, Debit Cards to Visa From Longtime Partner MasterCard
USAA, one of the nationâ€™s largest issuers of debit cards and credit cards, is switching its portfolio to Visa Inc., marking a blow for MasterCard Inc., which processed USAA transactions on its network for roughly 30 years.
The move is the latest in a continuing scramble of large portfolios hotly sought-after by payment networks Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co. It is relatively rare, however, for a card issuer, such as USAA, to switch network affiliations after such a long relationship.
