French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announces resignation
PARIS, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Wednesday said he was resigning after serving nearly four years in the position.
Fabius, 69, told reporters he attended his final Cabinet meeting, signaling his resignation. Fabius previously served as the youngest French prime minister in the mid-1980s.
As part of French President Francois Hollande's Cabinet, Fabius was seen as the architect of the country's tough foreign policy. In the past three years, France has sent forces to battle militants in Mali and has taken part in conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State.
France has been seen as the United States' foremost ally in the fight against Islamic extremism. Fabius was involved in helping negotiate anuclear agreement with Iran and also presided over the historic U.N. climate change conference in Paris, which led to an international agreement.
"We did good work, and France can be proud," Fabius said Wednesday.
Hollande said he will nominate Fabius for a position to lead France's Constitutional Council, which ensures bills comply with the constitution.
Fabius' resignation follows that of Christiane Taubira, who was in charge of the Justice Ministry before recently stepping down. Hollande needs to replace both ministers and is expected to make other Cabinet changes.
