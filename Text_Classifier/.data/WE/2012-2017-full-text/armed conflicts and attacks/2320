International powers agree on Syria deal
World powers have agreed to a plan for a transition in Syria that could include current regime members, but envoy Kofi Annan doubted if Syrians would pick leaders "with blood on their hands".
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear on Saturday that Washington did not see any role for President Bashar al-Assad in the new regime, even though there was no explicit call for him to cede power.
"Assad will still have to go. He will never pass the mutual consent test," said Clinton.
She also said the United States would "accelerate" its work at the Security Council on a resolution that would "impose real and immediate consequences for non-compliance, including sanctions."
