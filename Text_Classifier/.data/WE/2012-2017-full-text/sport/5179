Tragedy struck in a Dairy Queen drive-thru in Iowa, when a 74-year-old man was killed by his own truck as he tried to jumpstart the vehicle. On April 16, Curtis Schantz of Alburnett was in the drive-thru of the ice cream chain when his truck broke down, The Gazette reports. Authorities say Schantz got out of the truck and opened the hood in an attempt to fix the vehicle when it rolled forward, running him over before he could get out of the way. Suffering life-threatening injuries from the freak accident, Schantz was taken to a hospital where he later died, police said. The loss of the master electrician and longtime volunteer firefighter is being mourned all throughout Alburnett, KWWL reports.
