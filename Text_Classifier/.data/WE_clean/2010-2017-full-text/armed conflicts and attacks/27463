80 dead, atleast 230 wounded in Kabul suicide blasts, ISIS claims responsibility
At least 80 dead and 230 wounded in an explosion caused by suicide bomber near the mass demonstration in Kabul, confirmed Afghanistan ministry of public health, today.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's Amaq News Agency said. 
According to the local media, the explosion occurred at Dehmazang Circle of the Afghanistan's capital where thousands of people from minority Shia Hazaras were demonstrating over a power route line.
This was second demonstration over the power line issue, last one being in the month of May earlier this year.
Footage and photographs posted on social media and the local media showed a scene of carnage, with numerous bodies and body parts spread across the square.
Central Kabul was put under lock-down by the authorities with major intersections being blocked as the protesters sought to march on the presidential palace, waving flags and chanting slogans such as "death to discrimination".
 The demonstrators were demanding the 500 kV transmission line from Turkmenistan to Kabul be rerouted through two provinces with large Hazara populations, an option the government says would cost millions and delay the badly needed project by years.
The so-called TUTAP line is backed by the Asian Development Bank with involvement of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The original plan routed the line through Bamiyan province, in the central highlands, where most of the country's Hazaras live.
According to the World Bank reports, Afghanistan is in critical dearth of power and almost 75 percent of electricity is imported. The country has less than 40 per cent of its population connected to the national grid, according to the World Bank.
