Real Madrid's Jose Mourinho 'escapes knife attack'
A man armed with a dagger is reported to have tried to stab Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho as he signed autographs in a Spanish airport.
A member of the club's security staff was said to have received a 4cm (1.5in) stab wound in the incident at La Coruna in Galicia, northern Spain.
The incident happened last Friday but has only just been reported by the Cadena Ser news channel.
It is not clear if Mr Mourinho was aware of the attack at the time.
Cadena Ser says the security staff member did not realise he had been stabbed until he was on the team bus.
However, security cameras at the airport may have captured the incident, it says.
Quoting a source at Real Madrid, Cadena Ser says the club has increased security for its game against Racing Santander this weekend.
