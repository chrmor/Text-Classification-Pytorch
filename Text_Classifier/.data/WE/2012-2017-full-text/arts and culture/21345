Oscars 2017: Complete winners list
The 89th Academy Awards show was certainly one for the books. When was all said and done, front-runner "La La Land" won in six of its 14 nominated categories, including best actress and best director.
In the most shocking moment of the night, "Moonlight" won best picture â€” after "La La Land" was mistakenly announced as the winner.
"This is not a joke," Jordan Horowitz, a producer of "La La Land" said onstage, correcting the big error. Then the cast and crew of "Moonlight" took the stage and accepted the award.
In addition to its best picture win, the film's star Mahershala Ali took home his first Oscar, for best actor in a supporting role, and its writers, Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, won for best adapted screenplay.
Viola Davis also took home her first Oscar, for best supporting actress for "Fences," and got an enthusiastic standing ovation.
"I became an artist, and thank God I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life," she exclaimed, tearing up as she thanked her parents, sisters, husband and child.
Casey Affleck and Emma Stone chose to pay homage to their fellow nominees. Affleck called Denzel Washington "one of the first people who taught me how to act." Stone said, "It's such an honor to stand beside you" and added, "Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and being the greatest partner."
