Greek Government Could Be Formed by Wednesday
ATHENS — Antonis Samaras, the leader of the center-right New Democracy party that finished first in the Greek parliamentary elections, was poised on Tuesday to form a coalition government with the Socialists and a smaller left-wing party.
In a televised statement on Tuesday, the leader of the Socialists, Evangelos Venizelos, said it was urgent to complete the negotiations quickly. The government could come together as early as midday on Wednesday, he added.
But even before the government could be formed, Greek political leaders were contending with its main structural flaw: that they must disown the very agreement that Europe had championed them for upholding.
Mr. Venizelos, in his comments on Tuesday, noted that many of the tough terms of the bailout that he helped work out while serving as finance minister had been “imposed” on Greece during the first phase of the negotiations, when the critical goal was to seal a deal quickly to ensure that Athens did not run out of money to pay its bills. He said that the agreement was always seen as open to revision.
At the same time, Mr. Venizelos and other leaders of his party, which is known as Pasok, as well as the top ranks of the third would-be coalition member, the Democratic Left, were hinting that they might seek to avoid responsibility for decisions of the new government by limiting their participation in the cabinet that would be formed under Mr. Samaras. They were also seeking to block any participation in the government by ministers who served under the governments that negotiated the original bailout agreements.
