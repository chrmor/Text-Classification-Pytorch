London 2012 Paralympics closing ceremony â€“ as it happened
Already an incredible atmosphere here in the stadium with a good hour to go until kick off. The athletes are filing in in their team track suits, cheered and waved by the Gamesmakers that have done so much to make London 2012 unique.
On the walk to the stadium the main drag was full of Paralympians on their way to the stadium. They posed for photographs and were cheered and encouraged by the Gamesmakers. My colleague Richard Williams has just been telling me how different that easy informality is to Beijing. Seeing the (victorious) Chinese team cheered on by a bunch of rambunctious volunteers, he wondered what they made of it all.
Rather dramatic classical music is blaring out of the speakers at the moment, adding a sense of occasion and drama to the evening. It's rammed outside, as people fill up on fish and chips and get a few - eye-wateringly priced - beers on the go.
The cauldron has been moved into the main arena and is burning bright against the clear evening sky. In front of us, in the middle of the arena, is a large circular stage, presently to be occupied by Coldplay - who, by all accounts, are going to do a good 15 or so songs. Joy!
Still - the mood is electric and people are clearly determined to have a good time. This is the very last party of what has been an amazing six weeks, and people are going to enjoy every second of it.
