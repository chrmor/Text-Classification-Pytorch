Chemical castration, death now punishments for child sex abuse in Indonesia
JAKARTA, May 26 (UPI) -- Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday signed an executive order declaring that child sexual abuse is punishable by chemical castration and death.
The new regulation follows the April brutal gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl, who was found naked and tied up in a forest in the island of Sumatra. A group of seven teenagers have been imprisoned for 10 years over the rape and killing.
Chemical castration is a method of using drugs to reduce sexual desire or sexual activity. The new executive order -- or government regulation in lieu of law or Perppu as it is known in Indonesia -- is effective immediately and can also force convicted pedophiles who have served prison terms to wear ankle monitors so security officials can track their whereabouts.
"Sexual violence against children, as I have said, is an extraordinary crime," Widodo said Wednesday. "We hope that this law will be a deterrent for offenders and can suppress sexual crimes against children."
Widodo said the order was drafted to address increases in sexual violence against children but the Indonesian president did not offer statistics to illustrate the increase. Indonesia's Parliament has the power to overturn the order or to demand revisions.
"This regulation stipulates harsher sanctions and additional punishments for sex criminals, with certain requirements," Widodo in Jakarta. "Chemical castration and the use of electronic tags are also among the tougher measures regulated by the Perppu," he said.
"We hope the House will agree with the government and can immediately pass the Perppu," Widodo added. "We hope that with the presence of This regulation could be a deterrent effect for offenders and can suppress sexual crimes against children that this is an extraordinary crime."
