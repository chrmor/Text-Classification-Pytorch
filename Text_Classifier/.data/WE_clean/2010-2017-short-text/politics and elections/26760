Joining their 12 colleagues from the day before, Luciana Berger, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Kate Green, Nia Griffith, John Healey, Lisa Nandy and Owen Smith resign from the Labour Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn, alongside 18 junior shadow ministers and 9 additional frontbenchers, while Angela Smith and Steve Bassam of the House of Lords leadership will boycott attending Shadow Cabinet meetings, all in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership over the EU referendum, and the firing of Hilary Benn.
