Mel Gibson Charged With Misdemeanor Battery; Will Appear In Court Friday Afternoon
Mel Gibson has been charged with a misdemeanor battery complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court and is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 PM to accept his plea deal on the case.
The LA District Attorney’s Office filed the complaint in LA Superior Court on Friday morning. The DA contends in their court filing, obtained by Access Hollywood, that Gibson committed battery against his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva on around January 6, 2010.
As previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, Gibson – through his attorney Blair Berk — reached an agreement with prosecutors and made a plea deal in the case, which was worked out several days ago.
The plea deal would keep Gibson out of jail, however, the actor will be required to give a DNA sample and be fingerprinted.
According to Friday’s court filing, a Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) “may have been generated… involving the charges alleged” in the case.
In a statement to Access Hollywood earlier in the week, Berk explained why the actor accepted a plea deal.
“I know from almost 20 years as a criminal defense lawyer that sometimes justice can come for a client at too high a personal price. That is particularly so for Mel, whose right to due process can only be exercised in this case with an enormous media circus attached,” the statement read. “Mel’s priority throughout all of this has been that the best interests of his young daughter Lucia and the rest of his children be put first in any decisions made. It is with only that in mind that he asked me to approach the District Attorney with a proposal that would bring all of this to an immediate end.”
Gibson is alleged to have struck Grigorieva during the incident, but she did not report it for months.
Gibson and Grigorieva are parents to a daughter, Lucia, who was born in 2009.
