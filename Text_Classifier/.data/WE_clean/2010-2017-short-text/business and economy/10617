The Spanish "Indignants" protest movement celebrates its first anniversary, with at least 100,000 people gathering in Spanish cities to protest against the politicians and bankers widely blamed for the country's economic downturn. Similar protests take place in other world cities, including London, Lisbon, Frankfurt and Tel Aviv, as part of a global day of action.
