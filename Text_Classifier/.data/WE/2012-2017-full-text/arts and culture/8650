'12 Years,' 'Hustle,' Blanchett among top winners
Leonardo DiCaprio joked that he never thought he'd win a Golden Globe for a comedy, but that's just what he did, taking home the trophy for best actor in a musical or comedy film for his role as a hedonistic broker in "The Wolf of Wall Street." He praised the film's director, Martin Scorsese, with whom he's worked five times, saying, "Thank you for your mentorship." DiCaprio also commended the other unlikely "comedians" nominated in the category with him, including Christian Bale.
