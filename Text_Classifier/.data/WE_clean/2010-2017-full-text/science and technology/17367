Alert Notice 495:  Bright Type-Ia Supernova PSN J09554214+6940260 and Observing Campaign
Coordinates: R.A. = 09 55 42.15, Decl.= +69 40 25.8 (2000.0) PSN J09554214+6940260 is offset 54" west, 21" south from the nucleus of M82
Spectra: PSN J09554214+6940260 is a reddened young Type-Ia supernova discovered before maximum, according to a report by Y. Cao (Caltech), M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie/Princeton), A. McKay (UT Austin), and A. Bradley (APO) on behalf of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory Collaboration of spectra obtained on 2014 Jan. 22.305 UT using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph on the ARC 3.5m telescope (ATel #5786, http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=5786). They also report the best superfit match is SN2002bo at -14d, and that the supernova has a red continuum and deep Na D absorption.
Observing Campaign: Both visual and CCD observations are encouraged. Please use the available sequence from VSP. CCD observers are encouraged to perform filtered photometry, and if possible to transform their observations to the standard photometric system of their filters.
In addition to photometric follow-up of this supernova by our visual and instrumental observers, rapid V-band time-series has been requested by Dr. Bradley Schaefer (Louisiana State University) for an exploratory search for possible flares or other short-term photometric variations during the outburst. Dr. Schaefer writes:
"Fast variability is *not* expected from supernovae (because the shell is too large to change fast), but then no one has ever looked. Similarly, no one [expected] fast variations from novae during their optically-thick shell phase, but the first time anyone looked, for U Sco in 2010, the nova was seen to have many hour-long flares, with these still being completely unexplained.
"The M82 SN is bright and well-placed in the sky, so AAVSO people can get fast time series with good photometric accuracy and long time coverage. Importantly, many observers are needed, because any flare (or dip) will have to have independent confirmation. And this means that many observers are needed so that we can always get overlapping time series....
"Keep on the supernova all night for as long as you can. Long time series improves your chances of catching a perhaps-infrequent flare/dip, improves the baseline for detecting flare/dips, and makes for more observers catching a flare/dip as independent confirmation."
Dr. Schaefer requests observations with S/N of 100 or better (errors of 0.01 magnitude or less), made with a V filter. Observers are encouraged to follow this object for as much of the night as possible and for as long as possible during the outburst. Please use comparison stars provided via AAVSO charts.
