US apologises to APJ Abdul Kalam for frisking incident
NEW DELHI: The US has apologised to former President APJ Abdul Kalam for subjecting him to frisking at New York's JFK Airport , an incident that had provoked sharp reactions from India which threatened retaliatory action. In a written apology to Kalam and the Indian government, the US said, "Appropriate procedure for expedited screening of dignitaries had not been followed". "We deeply regret the inconvenience that resulted for him (Kalam) as a result of the September 29 incident involving the security screening at JFK Airport in New York," a statement from the US Embassy here said, noting that it had the utmost respect for Kalam. They also said that US was actively working to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Taking serious note of the incident, India had threatened retaliatory action with external affairs minister SM Krishna directing Indian ambassador to US Nirupama Rao to take up the matter in writing at the "highest level" with Washington. The US said that subsequent to the frisking incident, US Charge d' Affairs Peter Burleigh personally hand delivered a letter from the US transportation security administrator to Kalam and a similar letter was delivered to the government of India regretting the incident. Maintaining that it "deeply values and appreciates" the strong relationship and partnership with India, the US said, "We are confident that despite this regrettable incident, we will continue working closely with India in the many areas of our strategic partnership". 80-year-old Kalam was frisked in New York on September 29 before boarding an Air India flight. Sources said that even after Kalam had taken his seat in the aircraft, the US security personnel forced the crew to open the door and took away the jacket and boots of the former president to check for explosives since they had forgotten to do so before his boarding. The items were later returned to Kalam.
