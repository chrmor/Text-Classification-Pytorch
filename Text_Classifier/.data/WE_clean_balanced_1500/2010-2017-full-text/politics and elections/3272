Live blog: Santorum wins Southern double-header
We live blogged the results from tonight's GOP presidential primaries, and Rick Santorum was a surprise winner in both Alabama and Mississippi.
Pre-primary polls had projected a tight three-way race among Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the two states. Ron Paul didn't really compete in the Deep South and finished well behind his rivals.
"We did it again," a jubilant Santorum said in Louisiana, as he made the case that he is the best conservative to face President Obama in the fall.
Caucuses are also being held tonight in Hawaii and American Samoa. Read full coverage by USA TODAY's Susan Page and Rick Jervis in Wednesday's editions.
11:40 p.m. ET: Romney sends out a news release congratulating Santorum on his victories. It's one of the rare nights when Romney does not hold an election night rally.
"I am pleased that we will be increasing our delegate count in a very substantial way after tonight. Ann and I made a lot of new friends in Alabama and Mississippi, and we look forward to campaigning in those states in the general election," Romney said.
11:14 p.m. ET: In congressional races in Alabama, House Ethics Committee Chairman Jo Bonner won his GOP primary while House Financial Services Committee Chairman Spencer Bachus was leading his Republican rivals.
11:07 p.m. ET: Gingrich says he can't compete with Romney when it comes to money, as he tells the story of getting his 175,000th donor. He says it was a "humbling" conversation. "With your help, if you talk to your friends and neighbors ... we will continue to run a people's campaign. After the primaries are over, it will be obvious that the so-called front-runner didn't get there," Gingrich says.
11:05 p.m. ET: "We can forget about nominating a Massachusetts moderate," Gingrich says about Romney, arguing it's time to focus on who can best beat Obama.
Gingrich is denouncing the news media for asking "why doesn't he quit" and acknowledges he'll have a tough time raising money because he didn't win in either Mississippi or Alabama.
11:02 p.m. ET: Gingrich says "great solutions" require "substance" and that "virtually everything Barack Obama knows is wrong."
11 p.m. ET: "Ideas matter," Gingrich says. He argues that he's a "visionary leader" on the order of Ronald Reagan, and denounces the "petty baloney" of GOP primary attacks.
10:59 p.m. ET: Gingrich makes his case that he's the one who can go "toe-to-toe" with Obama in the general election debates. He thanks the Mississippi and Alabama voters for helping him "change the national dialogue" on rising gas prices. Gingrich has said he can get gas prices down to $2.50 a gallon if he's elected president.
10:59 p.m. ET: "It's quite an evening. Obviously I would have liked to come in first," Gingrich says, as he congratulates Santorum for a "positive evening."
Because delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, Gingrich says he will have a "substantial" number after tonight.
"The elite media's effort to convince the nation that Mitt Romney is inevitable just collapsed," Gingrich tells the Birmingham crowd. "In both states, the conservative candidates got 70% of the vote. If you're the front-runner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a front-runner."
10:56 p.m. ET: Callista Gingrich is introducing her husband, who appears to be finishing behind Santorum in both states.
10:49 p.m. ET: CNN projects Santorum will win a "double-header" and also take Mississippi.
10:43 p.m. ET: "If we nominate a conservative, we will defeat Barack Obama," Santorum says. Some in the crowd appeared to be telling him that he has also won Mississippi, but the networks haven't projected a winner just yet.
10:42 p.m. ET: Santorum blows a kiss to the crowd, shakes his head and says, "Bless you." He says he expects a "huge win" in Louisiana.
"We will compete everywhere. The time is now for conservatives to pull together," Santorum says. "The time is now to make sure we have the best chance to win this election ... and the best chance is to nominate a conservative who can take on President Obama on every issue."
10:39 p.m. ET: He says he wanted to be in Lafayette, La., because it's the heart of the oil and gas industry, before taking a jab at the Obama administration's energy policy. "This president almost put this whole region out of business," Santorum says, referring to a drilling moratorium after the 2010 BP oil spill. "We will put this town and this region back to work."
10:36 p.m. ET: Santorum says he was encouraged by the crowds in the Deep South. "To the people of Alabama, you made a great difference tonight," he says, before acknowledging the tight race in Mississippi.
10:34 p.m. ET: Santorum thanks his family, kisses his wife Karen and gives a shout-out to daughter Elizabeth, who is campaigning for him in Hawaii. (The Aloha State holds caucuses tonight.)
10:33 p.m. ET: Santorum takes a shot at Romney, who has been the best-funded GOP candidate. "For someone who thinks this race is inevitable ... he spent a whole lot of money against me for being inevitable."
10:32 p.m. ET: "We did it again," Santorum says. "I just want to thank everybody. What do people say to you? ... Most common thing I hear from people ... I'm praying for you."
10:30 p.m. ET: Santorum is making his way to the stage in Lafayette, La., to address his supporters.
10:27 p.m. ET: Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom tells CNN that there aren't enough opportunities in upcoming states for Santorum to close the delegate gap with Romney. He said the campaign met its goal of obtaining one-third of the delegates in the two contests.
10:18 p.m. ET: AP makes it official and says Santorum wins Alabama.
10:16 p.m. ET: CNN,The New York Times, The Washington Post and Fox News are also projecting an Alabama win for Santorum.
10:05 p.m. ET: AP has called some congressional primary races in Mississippi. Sen. Roger Wicker easily won his GOP primary, while Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson defeated Greenville Mayor Heather McTeer.
9:58 p.m. ET: The votes in the Deep South are too close to call, but the Obama campaign is focused on Romney. In an e-mail fundraising pitch, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina makes the argument that the fall campaign will be "tighter than you think."
"If the idea of a President Romney scares you, it's time to own a piece of this campaign," Messina writes, as he asks for a donation of $3 or more.
9:53 p.m. ET: NBC News is projecting Santorum will win the Alabama primary.
9:33 p.m. ET: Where are the candidates? Santorum is in Lafayette, La., where he's already campaigning for the Bayou State primary next week. USA TODAY's Rick Jervis is with Santorum tonight.
9:30 p.m. ET: Earlier this evening, the Gingrich campaign released a strategy memo about the candidate's strategy at "halftime." They argue that the half-way mark is the Louisiana primary on March 24.
"The sequencing and pace of the second half favors Newt," write Randy Evans, a senior Gingrich adviser, and Martin Baker, the national political director.
The memo discusses upcoming primaries in Southern states, as well as contests in delegate-rich states such as Texas and California.
"Here is the bottom-line reality: This nomination will not be decided until the fourth quarter – and that is not until June. It also means that the candidate who closes strongest in this race is going to win."
9:08 p.m. ET: A projection from one of the networks: "The only thing Fox News can project at this moment is that Ron Paul will come in fourth place in both Mississippi and Alabama," says the story on its website.
9:03 p.m. ET: The votes are coming in and, no surprise, the Alabama and Mississippi GOP races are too close to call. So we bring you news from other quarters:
A hypothetical race between President Obama and Romney is now a tossup, says a new Bloomberg News poll. Obama and Romney each get 47% support,
8:11 p.m. ET: More from AP on the early exit polls conducted by Edison Research, for the wire service and TV networks:
In Alabama and Mississippi, Santorum leads among the evangelical and born-again Christian voters who said a candidate's religious beliefs mattered to them.
The former Pennsylvania senator and Gingrich do better among the most conservative voters, while Romney is strong with moderates and those who say the economy matters to them.
For those voters who say they're concerned about beating Obama in the fall, Romney is their pick.
8 p.m. ET: The polls are now closed in Alabama and Mississippi. The exit polls show Romney, Santorum and Gingrich are bunched close together.
7:49 p.m. ET: Remember the GOP debates? The Atlantic reports Romney's campaign is saying the former Massachusetts governor is skipping the March 19 debate scheduled for Portland. This could mean the debates are really, really over.
Updated 7:17 p.m. ET: Polls have closed in parts of Alabama. Some highlights from early exit polls taken by the TV networks and the Associated Press:
About eight in 10 voters in Mississippi and three-quarters of those in Alabama were white evangelical or born-again Christians. Their share in Mississippi is the largest for any state that has voted so far in the GOP race.
About seven in 10 voters in both Deep South states considered themselves conservative. Two-thirds of voters in both say they are supporters of the small- government, anti-tax Tea Party movement.
Majorities in both states say the economy is their top concern. And the ability to defeat President Obama in the fall was something that four in 10 voters in Alabama and Mississippi said they were looking for in a GOP candidate.
Background from our original post begins here:
Key questions: Does Romney win in either state and solidify his grasp on the GOP nomination? Can Gingrich, the former House speaker and Georgia congressman, do well in his backyard and pick up some momentum? Will Santorum eke out a win to stake his claim on conservatives?
Romney, the overall delegate leader, has couched the two Southern states as an "away game" for him. Because delegates are awarded by proportion of the vote, each candidate stands to win some tonight -- thus ensuring the GOP race will continue.
Caucuses are also being held in Hawaii and American Samoa. Overall, the states and American Samoa have a total of 119 delegates, and most come from Alabama and Mississippi.
