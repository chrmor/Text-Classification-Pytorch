S. Korea confirms outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
South Korea confirmed a case of foot-and-mouth disease at a dairy farm, the agriculture ministry in Sejong said Monday.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said that 195 cows at the farm in Boeun, 180 kilometers southeast of Seoul, of North Chungcheong Province, tested positive for the animal disease.
Foot-and-mouth disease, which does not affect humans, is often fatal for cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows, sheep and pigs.
The ministry said it has taken measures to contain the suspected outbreak, including a ban on the movements by livestock and people near the farm.
South Korea reported its last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease on March 29 last year.
The country has been struggling with rapidly spreading avian influenza for nearly three months, with more than 30 million chickens and ducks culled. (Yonhap)
