New league chief coy on TV deal
Australian Rugby League commission chairman John Grant forecast a "significant increase" but called for patience as the game's new administration negotiates the all-important new NRL broadcast deal.
Grant signed the documents that ushered in his independent commission and a new era - ending News Ltd's role in running the code - at 12.03pm (AEDT) at the new $20m headquarters Rugby League Central in Sydney on Friday.
Grant was bullish but would not put a figure on the amount rugby league could get on its new five-year broadcast deal when asked in relation to the $1.25 billion achieved by the AFL last year.
"The game is in fantastic standing on the field and is the most-watched football sport in Australia," Grant said.
"We have obvious things we need to deal with. The biggest is the broadcast rights as this will secure the funding we need for the next five years, but this will take several months so we need to be patient.
"A reasonable expectation would be a significant increase on the current deal which expires at the end of the season."
