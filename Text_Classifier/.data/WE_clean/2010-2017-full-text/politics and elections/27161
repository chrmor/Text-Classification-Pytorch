Theresa May Joins U.K. Conservative Party’s Leadership Race
LONDON—British Home Secretary Theresa May announced her candidacy Thursday for the U.K. Conservative Party leadership race that will also decide the next prime minister, positioning herself as a safe pair of hands at a time when Britain’s future has been thrown into question.
Ms. May, one of the longest-serving home secretaries, said she could provide the strong leadership the country needed as it determines its future relationship with the European Union.
