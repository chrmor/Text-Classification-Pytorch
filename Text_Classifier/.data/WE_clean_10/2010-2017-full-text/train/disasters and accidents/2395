Military Blimp That Broke Free on the Ground in Pennsylvania
"We thought it was going to land," Hock told NBC News. "We thought it was going to pop, it got so low. We called 911, who said they were tracking it."
She said the blimp was dragging a cable, and "as it went it tore into lines and ripped poles out of ground."
The Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) surveillance aerostat landed at around 4 p.m. in a wooded area near Moreland Township, Pennsylvania, NORAD said.
There were no injuries reported. NORAD said a military recovery team was on the way to the area. Moreland Township is about 20 miles east of Williamsport, and about 120 miles northwest of the proving ground. At one point the blimp climbed to 16,000 feet, NORAD said.
The blimp had a tether of approximately 6,700 feet — more than a mile — attached when it broke free, Aberdeen Proving Ground said.
The dragging cable knocked out power to around 30,000 people in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf's office said in a statement. By Wednesday night power was restored to most customers, with 311 without electricity as of 11 p.m., power company PPL Electric said.
Power company PPL Electric Utilities said it was assessing damage caused by the cable, which occurred mainly in Columbia and Schuylkill counties, which are south of where the blimp came down.
The F-16 fighter jets, scrambled out of Atlantic City, New Jersey, followed the blimp but there was no thought of shooting the aerostat down, NORAD officials said.
The tail section detached first, and was found about a quarter-mile from where the rest of the blimp landed, officials said.
