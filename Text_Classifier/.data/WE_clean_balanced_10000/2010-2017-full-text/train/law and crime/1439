PYONGYANG, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- A South Korea-born Canadian pastor was sentenced to lifetime labor for subversion, the supreme court of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) announced Wednesday.
The 60-year-old Hyeon Soo Lim, who was born in Seoul, was accused of trying to overthrow the DPRK government and undermining its social system through conducting religious activities over the past 18 years.
The supreme court announced that Lim was guilty of joining the United States and South Korea in anti-DPRK human rights "racket" and fabricating and circulating false propaganda materials tarnishing the country's image.
He was also accused of funding and helping "defectors" to escape from the DPRK. He is said to have talked to U.S. ambassador to Mongolia on plans to get "defectors" out via Mongolia.
Lim confessed to all the crimes and showed deep remorse, according to the supreme court.
