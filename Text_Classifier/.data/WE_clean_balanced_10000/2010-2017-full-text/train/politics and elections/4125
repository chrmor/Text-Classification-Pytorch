Nauru election: President Baron Waqa re-elected as voting in Aiwo constituency postponed
Nauru's President Baron Waqa has been re-elected as an MP in his constituency, with all seats in the 19-member parliament finalised except for two seats in Aiwo halted due to a legal challenge.
Voting in the general election was completed on Saturday, but a legal technicality delayed voting in Aiwo constituency with the residents to now cast their votes on Monday.
"One of the candidates disputed the fact that he had been disqualified, so he took it to the court and the court put out an injunction," the chief of the international election observers Anote Tong said.
"As the polling was starting, the court order came and so it was stopped. Then there was a counter legal action. Eventually it was decided to not start, stop and go on the same day because it confused the voters. So the decision was to have it today [Monday]."
A newly-established Nauru Electoral Commission is conducting the general election for the first time.
There were 67 candidates vying for support from just under 8,000 registered voters.
The Government's official Twitter account said apart from the glitch affecting Aiwo, voting ran smoothly across the island nation.
Finance and Justice Minister David Adeang was returned to parliament, alongside Charmaine Scotty, Shadlog Bernicke and Valdon Dowitogo.
But Opposition MP and former president Sprent Dabwido failed in his re-election bid.
He told Pacific Beat he campaigned to uphold the constitution, but found it difficult to counter the Government.
"Indeed in our view there have been unfair practices which have led this Government to mechanic [sic] the system to produce the result they wanted, and this is exactly what happened," the former president said.
The Nauru Government thanked Mr Dabwido as well as other outgoing MPs Matthew Batsiua, Ludwig Scotty and Marcus Stephen for their service.
The election is being monitored by international observers, including a team from the Commonwealth led by Mr Tong, the former president of Kiribati.
"We have no doubt at all that everything that was carried out at the polling stations was very proper," he said on Monday.
"It was very relaxed, and in fact we had the impression that there was not a lot of interest by the candidates.
"Usually in the case of most elections, at the polling stations there are agents of the candidates. In this case, we did not spot any."
In an earlier statement, Mr Tong congratulated the people of Nauru for "participating peacefully and in high numbers" in Saturday's general election.
The Commonwealth Observer Mission is expected to finalise a report on the credibility of the elections before leaving Nauru on July 13.
Political instability has plagued Nauru, with reports of frequent government crackdowns on dissent.
During the election campaign, opposition MPs complained they were denied airtime on local media and prevented from holding local rallies.
But on Friday, Mr Dabwido said his party had eventually been allowed to run ads on local media after he raised concerns with foreign electoral observers.
Mr Tong said that the details of that complaint will be in his final report, but he found via his own research that broadcast advertising is traditionally low due to the scarcity of electoral funds available across the constituencies.
The election follows two years of turmoil in the island nation, during which five opposition MPs were suspended from parliament.
In September last year, New Zealand suspended most of its aid funding to the country, citing the "diminishing rule of law".
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also sought assurances from the Nauruan Government, which hosts an Australian-run immigration detention centre, that the rule of law was being upheld and the Opposition was being treated fairly.
The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression has also called on Nauru to withdraw legal changes which restrict freedom of expression, access to internet and social media and freedom of the press.
In December, the Commonwealth Secretariat concluded a fact-finding mission and found that rule of law concerns were being addressed in Nauru, but called on all parties to resolve their political differences.
