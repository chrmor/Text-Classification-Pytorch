New York AG orders Draftkings, FanDuel shut down in state
All bets are off.
Fantasy football sites DraftKings and FanDuel were shut down Tuesday in New York after Attorney General determined the gaming sites to be illegal gambling enterprises.
“Our investigation has found that, unlike traditional fantasy sports, daily fantasy sports companies are engaged in illegal gambling under New York law, causing the same kinds of social and economic harms as other forms of illegal gambling, and misleading New York consumers,” Schneiderman’s office said in a statement.
“Daily fantasy sports is neither victimless nor harmless, and it is clear that DraftKings and FanDuel are the leaders of a massive, multi-billion-dollar scheme intended to evade the law and fleece sports fans across the country.
“Today we have sent a clear message: not in New York, and not on my watch.”
DraftKings and FanDuel have bombarded the airwaves with ads promoting their no-obligation get-rich-quick games.
The sites have cashed in on the popularity of the multi-million dollar fantasy sports industry.
Entry fees on DraftKings range from 25 cents to more than $5,000. Some prizes top $1 million.
DraftKings and FanDuel say the sites provide games of skill and not of chance and are therefore protected by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act established in 2006, which has language protecting fantasy sports.
At issue is whether DraftKings and FanDuel — which charge customers an entry fee to draft fantasy sports teams to compete against other customers’ fantasy squads for a chance at big prize money — have violated federal laws in any way. The DOJ and FBI probe, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is looking into the business model of these companies.

In a letter to DraftKings, Schneiderman said “customers are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence, specifically on the real-game performance of professional athletes. Further, each DraftKings wager represents a wager on a 'contest of chance' where winning or losing depends on numerous elements of chance to a 'material degree.’”
Boston-based DraftKings issued a statement saying it is "very disappointed" in the attorney general's actions.
"We strongly disagree with the reasoning in his opinion and will examine and vigorously pursue all legal options available to ensure our over half a million customers in New York State can continue to play the fantasy sports games they love.”

A statement from New York-based FanDuel said the company runs a legal operation.
The National Basketball Association said it expects fantasy sports companies to act within the law. “We continue to monitor reports concerning daily fantasy sports,” said spokesman Mike Bass. “We expect the industry to respond appropriately to the issues that have been raised and continue to comply with all applicable laws.”
The National Football League and the NFL Players Association declined to comment. Officials from Major League Baseball deferred making a statement until they review the AG’s order.
The ruling makes New York the second state in recent weeks to shut down fantasy sports companies.
In October, the state of Nevada ruled the games were a form of gambling that required a license, forcing both companies from the Nevada market.
The industry exploded in controversy when reports surfaced recently that employees were regularly playing — and winning — on competing websites.
On Sept. 27, an employee at DraftKings won $350,000 in a contest sponsored by FanDuel.
The employee had access to proprietary data that could have helped him gain an advantage, but DraftKings denied that the employee used this data to win. Both companies subsequently restricted their employees from competing in daily fantasy contests on other sites.
