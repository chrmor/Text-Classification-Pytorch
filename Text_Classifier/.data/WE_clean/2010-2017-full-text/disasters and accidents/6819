SEOUL, May 17 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Myung-bak visited a state nuclear safety agency Tuesday, stressing the importance of transparent disclosure of safety-related information to gain people's trust in atomic power plants, his office said. Lee's first visit to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety in the central city of Daejeon, about 150 kilometers south of Seoul, came amid heightened concerns in the wake of Japan's nuclear crisis.
