Turkey Issues Arrest Warrant for a Rival of Its President
ISTANBUL — A Turkish court has issued an arrest warrant for an influential cleric and former ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania and whose followers have been accused of participating in a plot to overthrow the government, according to reports in the Turkish news media on Friday.
The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, 73, has been living in Pennsylvania since 1999, but still has a broad following in Turkey that has reached into elite law enforcement, judiciary and business circles. The warrant would most likely form the basis of a formal extradition request that analysts said the United States was unlikely to act upon.
The semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said prosecutors told the court they had collected evidence showing that Mr. Gulen “has committed crimes within the scope of the indictment” but that he could not be compelled to answer the charges “because of his long-term residence abroad.”
Mr. Gulen fled Turkey in the 1990s after being accused of plotting to topple the secularist government then in office. The charges against him were dropped in 2006, after elections that had elevated Mr. Erdogan and his Islamist Justice and Development Party.
As allies, Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Gulen embarked on an uneasy partnership to remove the military from Turkish politics, but once they accomplished that goal, quiet tensions between the two men festered and burst into a public feud last year when Mr. Erdogan accused Mr. Gulen of instigating a graft inquiry that implicated members of his inner circle.
