British, US embassies in China warn of threats
The British, U.S. and French embassies in China say they have received information of possible threats against Westerners visiting a popular shopping district in Beijing around Christmas.
The embassies sent out warnings to their citizens and staff, urging extra vigilance if they are in the Sanlitun district. The Australian embassy soon followed suit.
The district is home to a popular open-plan mall that boasts high-end brands like Mango, Reiss, and Lacoste, and some of Beijing's best Western dining.
In August, a woman was stabbed to death in broad daylight by a sword-wielding man there. The attacker also injured a French man. Beijing police said the man stabbed the two passerby "without cause or reason."
China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said authorities are familiar with the reports.
