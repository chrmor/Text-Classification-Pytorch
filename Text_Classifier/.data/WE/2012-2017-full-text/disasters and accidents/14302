Seven Killed in French Alps Avalanche Tuesday
Seven climbers were killed on Tuesday after an avalanche struck in the French Alps.
The avalanche occurred near the town of Pelvoux in southeast France at the Snow Dome on the Massif des Ecrins, about 4100 meters (13,451 feet) high.
Four Germans and three Czechs died in the avalanche, government officials in the Hautes-Alpes region reported on their website. One German was injured.
The avalanche struck three groups of roped climbers, Pierre Besnard, the ranking state official in the region, told The Associated Press.
At the time of the avalanche, there were clear to partly cloudy skies with light winds in the area, said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jason Nicholls.
Gendarmes, including dog handlers, were assisted by helicopters and doctors in the rescue and recovery mission, state officials said.
