Oscar Pistorius Convicted of Murder on Appeal, Faces 15 Years in Prison
"I'm very pleased for every women in South Africa because there's so much abuse and killing of partners and [the perpetrators] just walk free, and now we've got justice for that," she said. "I want respect for my daughter's life and that's what I got today [with] the conviction of murder. I feel so proud now that she's got some respect and she hasn't lost her life for nothing. She will be remembered and it's good for all the women in South Africa."
The case will now be sent back to South Africa's High Court for sentencing, which will likely take place next year. The minimum sentence for a murder conviction is 15 years — except for cases where the accused can show clear mitigating factors.
"A sentence of at least 15 years could be on the cards but we can expect Oscar Pistorius to testify again in court in a bid to get this reduced," South African criminal defense attorney Ulrich Roux told NBC News.
The Pistorius family said in a statement that its "legal team will study the finding and we will be guided by them in terms of options going forward."
His defense team could in theory appeal to the Constitutional Court of South Africa. But legal experts have told NBC News that there is no constitutional issue here, so that outcome is highly highly unlikely.
After being sentenced to five years in jail, Pistorius was released in October after less than a year. At the time, he was ordered to serve the rest of his sentence under "correctional supervision" — or house arrest.
