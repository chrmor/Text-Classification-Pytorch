body of woman recovered after car swept away in Maitland
The body of an 86-year-old woman has been recovered from the floodwaters into which her car was swept near Maitland on Wednesday morning.
Police Inspector Brian Tracey said the police divers had told him there was zero visibility in the water and that they had to feel their way to the car.
Divers searched the car and believe the elderly woman was travelling by herself.
The woman's 66-year-old son maintained a vigil by the water throughout the day, but just after 7pm any hopes of his mother's recovery were dashed when paramedics brought out her body on a stretcher.
