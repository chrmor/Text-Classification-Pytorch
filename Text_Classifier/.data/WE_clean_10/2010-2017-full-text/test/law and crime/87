Neighbors help Mexico identify massacre victims
Mexico sought help Thursday from Latin American nations to identify 72 presumed migrants murdered near the US border, after officials blamed the brutal Zetas drug gang for the massacre.
Diplomats from Honduras, El Salvador, Ecuador and Brazil arrived Thursday in northeastern Tamaulipas state to help identify victims found piled with their hands tied and blindfolded inside a warehouse on a ranch.
"The autopsies and identification of bodies have started based on documents carried by some of the victims," a spokesman for the Tamaulipas attorney general's office told AFP.
The process was complicated because many victims did not carry identity documents, said Salvadoran ambassador to Mexico Hugo Castillo.
An army spokesman said the military was stopping vehicles in the area for any leads on the killings.
An injured Ecuadoran man claiming to be the sole survivor of the massacre alerted the military to the ranch where he said the group had been kidnapped and killed by members of the Zetas for refusing to work for the cartel.
