Newt Gingrich wins Georgia GOP primary
Reporting from Washington — Newt Gingrich has won the Republican presidential primary in Georgia, according to the Associated Press.
Georgia was a must-win state for Gingrich, who crafted a Southern state strategy in his long-shot effort to win the Republican presidential nomination. That strategy hinges on a win in Georgia, the state he represented for 20 years as a member of Congress.
The primary was called based on exit polls, as precinct results had just started to come in.
Seventy-six delegates are at stake in the Georgia primary, and Gingrich is unlikely to win all of them. Thirty-four delegates will be awarded proportionally to candidates who receive more than 20% of the statewide vote. If a candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, he’ll win all 34 delegates.
An additional 42 delegates will be awarded based on the results in each of the state’s 14 congressional districts, where the winner in each district will win two delegates and the runner-up will win one delegate. Again, if a candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in a district, he’ll win all three of the district’s delegates.
