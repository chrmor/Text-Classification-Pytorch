Coast Guard jet's final landing place: The Oregon coast

A Coast Guard jet that served for 30 years on search-and-rescue missions on the East Coast made its final landing on the Oregon coast.
The retired HU-25 Falcon will soon go on permanent display at Sector Columbia River's Air Station Astoria in Warrenton. It landed in Oregon on Friday.
The Falcon officially retired June 21 at Air Station Cape Cod, MA. It was the primary fixed-wing aircraft for more than 30 years providing search and rescue, law enforcement, medical transportation and other services to the Atlantic Northeast.
The Falcon platform is being phased out throughout the Coast Guard in favor of the HC-144A Ocean Sentry, which is considered more efficient and is able to remain in the air for a greater amount of time.
"We are honored to welcome HU-25 Falcon 2104 to her final home at Air Station Astoria," said Capt. Bruce Jones, Sector Columbia River Commander. "She is retiring after more than 30 years of distinguished service to the nation and Coast Guard. We look forward to preparing a display area where Coast Guard men and women and visitors to Sector Columbia River can view the 2104 for many years to come."
