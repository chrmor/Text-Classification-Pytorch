Turkey summons German ambassador to Ankara over Kurdish rally in Cologne
Turkey summoned the German ambassador to Ankara in response to a large rally held by Kurds in Cologne on Saturday.
More than 10,000 people rallied in the west German city in support of an independence referendum in Iraq.
Ankara summoned ambassador Martin Erdmann to voice concern over what it called a militant rally, the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.
"We condemn the organization of a rally in the German city of Cologne by the extensions of the PKK terrorist organizations, and the allowing of terror propaganda. We have voiced our reaction in a strong manner to Germany's ambassador to Ankara, who was called to the ministry," it said.
On Saturday, Kurdish demonstrators called for freedom for Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), independence for Kurdistan, and democracy for the Middle East, local paper KÃ¶lner Stadt Anzeiger reported.
They had gathered at what was ostensibly a cultural festival organized by the Democratic Social Center for Kurds in Germany.
"We are protesting and celebrating at the same time - that is our culture," attendee Rifat Arslan told the paper, after traveling there from Frankfurt with his family. "We demand a recognized and free Kurdistan and want the release of our leader Ocalan," he was quoted as saying.
The PKK is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, Germany and the European Union.
Turkey accused Germany of not doing enough to stop PKK activities.
"The double standard approach Germany has been following with regards to the global fight against terrorism is worrying. We call on Germany to show a principled stance against all kinds of terror," the ministry said in the statement.
On September 3, about 25,000 Kurdish supporters demonstrated in Cologne against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, where they also carried posters of Ocalan.
