THE TD who named a rugby hero and journalist in the penalty points row is being reported to a Leinster House watchdog.
Independent TD Joan Collins was accused of abusing Dail privilege by naming Ireland rugby ace Ronan O'Gara and crime writer Paul Williams in the Dail for having penalty points cancelled by the gardai.
Ceann Comhairle Sean Barrett said he wrote to the group of Independent TDs raising the issue warning them not to name individuals.
He said he was now referring Ms Collins to the Dail committee on procedure and privileges.
A garda investigation continues into claims by a garda sergeant that thousands of penalty points for road traffic offences had been cancelled on appeal to a garda superintendent.
Ms Collins named the Munster out-half O'Gara and Mr Williams as being among the motorists who had penalty points written off.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein TD Padraig MacLochlainn is being suspended from the Dail for accusing the Ceann Comhairle of “double standards and hypocrisy” over the accusations directed at Gerry Adams by Taoiseach Enda Kenny yesterday.
Mr Kenny has challenged Mr Adams yesterday to “tell the truth” about the death of Jean McConville and also appeared to link Sinn Fein to the Northern Bank robbery.
