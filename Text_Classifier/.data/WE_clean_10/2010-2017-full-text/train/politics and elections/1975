PNG chooses new prime minister
Papua New Guinea has a new prime minister, after MPs voted to make former treasurer Peter O'Neill the replacement for ailing leader Sir Michael Somare.
Mr O'Neill, an MP from PNG's Southern Highlands, was sworn by Governor-General Michael Oglio at Port Moresby's government house on Tuesday afternoon, after MPs earlier elected him with a vote of 70 to 24.
The vote ousted Sam Abal, whom Sir Michael had appointed acting prime minister in his absence.
But less than an 90 minutes after the vote, Mr Abal declared he was going to challenge the decision in the courts.
The result of the vote was met with applause from MPs and from members of the public inside the chamber.
"I want to thank Sir Michael Thomas Somare for his trust in many of us who are here in this parliament," Mr O'Neill said after returning to parliament soon after being sworn in.
