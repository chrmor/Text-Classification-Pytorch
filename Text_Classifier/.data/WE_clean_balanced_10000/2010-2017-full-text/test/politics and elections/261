Robert Reich Rips Debbie Wasserman Schultz Over DNC Leak: ‘Fire Her Now’
Robert Reich, former Labor Secretary and a big liberal voice, tore into DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz over the leaked DNC emails and called for her to be fired.
Wasserman Schultz features heavily in the DNC email leak, including her calling Donald Trump a “sexist pig,” expressing serious frustrations with Bernie Sanders, and telling journalists to quit the negative coverage.
Reich said the emails clearly show the DNC tried to sandbag Bernie’s campaign,” and said, “Hillary should fire Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Now. Don’t wait until next week to replace her.”
And he wasn’t done there:
It is worth noting here that Clinton specifically thanked Wasserman Schultz by name during her joint rally with Tim Kaine this afternoon.
