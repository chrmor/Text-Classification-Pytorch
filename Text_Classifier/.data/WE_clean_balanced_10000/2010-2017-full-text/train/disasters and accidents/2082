Greek fighter jets in mid-air collision
Two Greek fighter jets collided in mid-air on Thursday, the defence ministry said, with one of the pilots apparently managing to eject safely.
The collision between the two F-16 planes, a one and two-seater respectively, happened south of the island of Crete, a ministry source told AFP.
"We're just getting the information now," the spokesman who declined to be named said.
"Three pilots were involved, and one of them was apparently seen ejecting from the aircraft."
Reports said two of the pilots have so far been picked up from the sea, one of them badly hurt.
The jets were part of a four-plane team on a training mission out of Souda air force base in the island's northwest, the defence ministry said.
Greek fighter pilots are in constant readiness over the Aegean Sea due to frequent incursions by Turkish aircraft into Greek-controlled airspace disputed by Turkey.
In a similar incident in 2006, a Greek pilot was killed when his plane collided with a Turkish jet during one of the regular mock dogfights in the area.
