Australian Olympic water polo goalie James Stanton banned two years for testing positive for banned substance
SYDNEY -- Two-time Olympic water polo player James Stanton has been banned for two years for testing positive for a banned substance.
The 27-year-old Australian goalkeeper tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol in an out-of-competition test last September.
The backdated suspension means Stanton can't compete until October of next year, ruling him out of next month's world championships and the 2012 London Olympics.
Stanton originally referred the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but has since withdrawn the appeal.
"On the advice of my legal team, and with great disappointment, I announce that I have accepted a sanction," Stanton said in a statement.
Clenbuterol is the same substance which three-time Tour de France champion cyclist Alberto Contador and five Mexico soccer players have tested positive for, but blamed on contaminated meat.
