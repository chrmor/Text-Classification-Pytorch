North Korea warns South Korea, America of nuclear attack
The second day of the joint US-South Korean "Ulchi Freedom Guardian" military exercises began on August 23 with a counterterrorism scenario on the Seoul Metro, including a mock situation in which a terrorist bombs the subway. North Korean Television condemned the exercises, posting a video entitled "ÂÂSeoul Will Burn in a Nuclear Flame."ÂÂ In the video, the news anchor says the joint US-Korean military exercises are preparation for "preemptive nuclear attack" and threatens to turn South Korea into ashes if the exercise takes on the appearance of aggression.

NORTH Korea has issued a fresh warning to Seoul and Washington, threatening a huge nuclear attack if provoked.
The North’s military warned it will turn the cities into “a heap of ash through a Korean-style pre-emptive nuclear strike” if they show any signs of aggression towards their territory, a spokesman for North Korea’s military was quoted as saying by the country’s state media.
This comes as South Korea and the US begin their annual military drills, which South Korea has described as defensive in nature.
The allied countries have repeatedly stated they have no intention of invading or taking aggressive action against North Korea capital Pyongyang.
South Korea President Park Geun-Hye responded to the threats saying: “The North Korean regime has been continuously suppressing its people by its reign of terror while ignoring the livelihood of its people.”
She also said the South would “prepare” for any potential attacks by North Korea, adding that the communist country’s nuclear and missile threats are “direct and realistic”.
Relations between the countries are tenser than usual now, following the defection of a senior North Korean diplomat and a US plan to place a hi-tech missile defence system in South Korea.
Earlier this month, it was reported South Korea intends to arm itself with nuclear weapons.
The state will develop a nuclear self-defence strategy in defiance of a treaty that has been in place for almost 50 years.
“It will become a domino effect and even South Korea will become concerned and develop nuclear weapons, and maybe Japan as well,” a senior official in the Seoul government told Fairfax.
Meanwhile, over the weekend, Australia surprised the world by being the only country to attempt to block an international ban on nuclear weapons.
The Australian government tried — and ultimately failed — to block a United Nations report for a complete international ban on nuclear weapons.
A statement on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s website argues that “while a near-term ban treaty on nuclear weapons might seem to be a straightforward and emotionally appealing way to delegitimise and eradicate nuclear weapons, the Australian Government does not believe disarmament can be imposed in this way”.
“We need to create an environment where all countries, including the nuclear-armed states and those who rely on their nuclear umbrellas, believe themselves to be more secure without nuclear weapons.”
