Machete Attack on Police May Be Terrorism, Belgian Premier Says
A machete attack on police in southern Belgium that wounded two officers may have been an act of terrorism, Prime Minister Charles Michel said, citing “preliminary indications” in the investigation.
Michel cut short his vacation in France and has called a meeting of his National Security Council for Sunday, Belgian media reported. The national threat level remains at 3, the second-highest, following twin suicide bombings on March 22 that killed 32 people at the Brussels airport and a downtown subway station in the capital.
On Saturday, an assailant with a machete and shouting “Allahu Akbar” injured two female officers at a police station in the southern Belgian city of Charleroi, according to local police. The attacker, who hasn’t been identified, was shot by a third officer and later died.
“I condemn the attack in Charleroi,” Michel said in a posting on his Twitter account. “We are following the situation closely.” Interior Minister Jan Jambon said the assault was a “despicable act.”
The case has been sent to the federal prosecutor’s office, broadcaster RTL reported.
