Mistrial Is Declared in Dewey & LeBoeuf Case
Edith Hines, another juror, said she was not persuaded of the guilt of the defendants, in particular Mr. Davis and Mr. DiCarmine. Ms. Hines briefly hugged Mr. Davis in the hallway outside the courtroom at 100 Centre Street.
The jurors indicated the panel remained divided on the most serious charges. In a vote on Monday on one of the grand larceny charges, Ms. Hines, a retired state worker, said the panel had voted 8 to 4 to acquit all three defendants.
Early in the deliberations, Ms. Schur said there had been some heated arguments between jurors. In recent days, she said, the jury had requested a set of markers to prepare a timeline of events to help with the deliberations.
The jury’s two partial verdicts delivered more than a week ago had suggested the panel had more questions about Mr. Sanders’s culpability than that of Mr. Davis and Mr. DiCarmine, who were known simply as “the Steves” within Dewey. The jury before the deadlock had acquitted Mr. Davis on 23 charges and Mr. DiCarmine on 21 charges but voted to acquit Mr. Sanders on only 14 charges.
To some degree that is not surprising, since no witness during the trial ever testified that either Mr. Davis or Mr. DiCarmine had given specific instructions to do anything wrong. The testimony was a bit more ambiguous about Mr. Sanders’s role, however.
Mr. Davis, the law firm’s former chairman, was an architect of the 2007 merger of two law firms that created Dewey & LeBoeuf, and he led the firm until April 2012, a few weeks before it filed for bankruptcy. Mr. DiCarmine, the firm’s former executive director, and Mr. Sanders, the firm’s former chief financial officer, were other major figures in Dewey’s management team. All three men were trained as lawyers.
Elkan Abramowitz, the lawyer for Mr. Davis, said the prosecution reflected an attempt by prosecutors to “overcriminalize” conduct best handled in civil court.
