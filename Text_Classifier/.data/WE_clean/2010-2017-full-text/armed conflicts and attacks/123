Fourth church firebombed
A MALAYSIAN church was firebombed yesterday, the fourth such attack in two days as a row escalated over the use of the word ''Allah'' by non-Muslims.
The Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in south-west Kuala Lumpur was the latest target. There were no reports of injuries.
Church authorities found that petrol bombs had been thrown at the windows of the first and second floors of the three-storey building, the church's Bishop Philip Loke said.
''They narrowly missed it, but part of the walls are burnt,'' he said, adding: ''We suspect this attack is linked to the other attacks.''
Three other churches in the Kuala Lumpur area were hit on Friday, prompting Prime Minister Najib Razak to vow to crack down on race crime.
One of the churches attacked on Friday was badly burned while firebombs thrown at two others failed to cause damage.
