Al-Qaeda gunmen seize Yemen city Zinjiba
Government officials said that the provincial capital was under the control of militants after fighting that began on Friday and had claimed 16 lives, including civilians.
The fighters "were able to gain control of the city of Zinjibar ... and took over all government facilities" a security official told AFP. Only the headquarters of the the 25th mechanised brigade was holding out, he added, but it was besieged by the gunmen.
A local resident said: "About 300 Islamic millitants and al-Qaeda men came into Zinjibar and took over everything on Friday."
Zinjibar is the capital of Abyan province in south central Yemen. The impoverished state, which was the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, has been wracked by violence amid protests to end President Ali Abdullah Saleh's near 33-year rule.
Washington considers al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the Yemen-based al-Qaeda franchise - to be the world's most active terrorist cell.
The group, whose leaders includee the influential preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, has strongholds in remote mountain regions in the Yemeni provinces of Shabwa, Abyan, Jouf and Marib.
An official said that another two soldiers were killed on Friday in clashes with suspected al-Qaeda fighters in the town of Loder, also in Abyan province.
