Take That gigs crash Ticketmaster site
The volume of demand for Take That tickets crashed the Ticketmaster website this morning as thousands of fans tried to secure tickets for the band’s two Croke Park concerts.
Tickets for the July 18th concert went on sale at 8am and sold out within about 30 minutes. Tickets for the July 19th concert went on sale at about 8.40am and were "selling well" before the site crashed.
Some 82,000 tickets a night are available for the Dublin shows.
The problems were sparked by the volume of fans in the UK coming online to secure tickets for the British concerts which went on sale at 9am.
The tour includes four nights at Wembley Stadium and the unprecedented demand also caused problems for online ticket sales in the UK.
“The reaction has amazed everyone.Ticketmaster never seen [such] reaction before. This has never happened in history of Ireland that the whole system has collapsed,” Justin Green of promoter MCD said.
He said the problem was “intermittent” and advised fans who wanted to book tickets to phone Ticketmaster or go to one of their more than 100 outlets across the State.
“It just shows the sheer reaction to Take That and Robbie Williams in Croke Park,” he said.
Mr Green said that the Irish show swould be sold out by the end of the day.
The reunited Take That, including Robbie Williams, will be their first tour of the original “boy band” incarnation since they split in 1995.
