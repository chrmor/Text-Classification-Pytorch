UPDATE 1-Syrian forces fire on Deraa protesters-witnesses
AMMAN, May 26 (Reuters) - Syrian security forces fired live rounds on Thursday at hundreds of protesters marching in a night demonstration in the southern city of Deraa to demand the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, two witnesses said.
Night demonstrations have been erupting daily in Deraa and other cities and towns across Syria to circumvent a heavy security presence that intensified in the past several weeks after street protests grew in numbers and tanks were deployed inside urban centres.
