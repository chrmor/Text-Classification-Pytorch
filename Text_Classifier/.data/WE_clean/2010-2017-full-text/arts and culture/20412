'Stay With Me' wins Grammy for best song
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” "Stay With Me (Darkchild Version)" has won the Grammy for song of the year.
The songwriter's award goes to its performer Sam Smith, who wrote it with British writers James Napier and William Phillips.
The soulful song was the lead single on Smith's album "In the Lonely Hour," and fits its mood. Smith had already won the Grammy for best new artist Sunday, and "In the Lonely Hour" was honored as best pop vocal album. Smith recently gave songwriting credits to Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne because of the song's resemblance to Petty's hit "I Won't Back Down."
He competed with the songs "All About That Bass," performed by Meghan Trainor; "Chandelier," performed by Sia; "Shake It Off," performed by Taylor Swift; and "Take Me to Church," performed by Hozier.
