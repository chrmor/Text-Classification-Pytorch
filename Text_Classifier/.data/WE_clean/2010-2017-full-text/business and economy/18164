Departing SoCal Flights Resume After Being Grounded
The FAA said Wednesday afternoon that an air traffic control computer glitch caused ground holds from coast to coast. Fortunately, it only lasted an hour and it came at the slowest time of the day. But it was still a problem for thousands of people. Ted Chen reports for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, April 30, 2014. (Published Wednesday, April 30, 2014)
Travelers scrambled on Wednesday to make alternate plans after a computer glitch grounded flights for more than an hour at airports across the country.
Lines of airplanes stacked up on taxiways at LAX while federal officials worked to correct the "technical issues" that occurred at the FAA's Los Angeles Air Traffic Control Center.
Meanwhile, flights bound for Southern California from airports nationwide were also ordered about 2:20 p.m. to remain on the ground, according to the FAA.
Travelers at LAX, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Ontario and Oakland airports reported flights being halted.
"Some flights were diverted and the agency issued a nationwide groundstop for flights heading into the airspace managed by the center. The agency is gradually restoring the system," FAA officials said.
NBC4 viewers said planes had to turn around mid-flight.
"My plane was supposed to land @ LAX from Oakland and we had to turnaround!" Janice Ponce Brown said via Facebook.
Another viewer said a flight into John Wayne Airport was "in holding status" and not able to land.
Travelers were urged to contact their airlines for flight information. LAX officials said to expect a one-hour delay on all departing flights.
