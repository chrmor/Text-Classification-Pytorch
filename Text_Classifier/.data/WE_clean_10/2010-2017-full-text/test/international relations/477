On Friday, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov met with the newly appointed Saudi ambassador, conveying the “necessity of a ceasefire” to create favorable conditions for a peaceful national dialogue.
Russia has already taken steps to evacuate all of its personnel from its Yemeni consulate, which was damaged in the conflict. It has also taken an active role evacuating Russian nationals and other civilians from the country.

The world security body “should speak in a principled manner for ending any violence…in the Yemen crisis,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, adding that a draft resolution on the crisis has already been submitted to the UNSC.
Echoing Lavrov’s words, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich also called on immediate cessation of hostilities, adding that Russia will continue active diplomatic efforts in dealing with all Yemeni factions and Middle Eastern partners in order to restart political process. Lukashevich also called on the UN special envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, to play a bigger role in the settlement of the crisis.

On Thursday, Saudi Arabia claimed that there that there were no “formal” troops on the ground in Yemen. However, the “issue of using ground troops is always something that is on the table,” Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir said at an event in Washington.
The UN estimates that over 500 people, many civilians, have been killed in Yemen over the past two weeks. Though the allied Air Force target mostly military facilities, weapon depots and infrastructure, their strikes still befell on civilians. Tens of thousands have fled the country after the outbreak of violence.
