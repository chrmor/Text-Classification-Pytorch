News Limited sells Fiji Times
Australia's News Limited has sold the Fiji Times for an undisclosed sum to Fiji company Motibhai.
The move follows a decree by the Fiji interim government that forced Fiji-based media outlets to be transferred into 90% local ownership, AAP reports.
News Ltd chief executive John Hartigan says his company has been a reluctant seller of Fiji's oldest newspaper.
The deal comes less than two weeks before the expiry of the deadline set by the interim regime.
