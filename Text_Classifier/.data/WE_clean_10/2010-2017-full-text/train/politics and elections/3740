US vice president candidates to meet in debate
The vice presidential candidates from the two major parties in the US presidential election will face each other later in a debate for the first time.
Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party running-mate Tim Kaine will go head-to-head against Republican candidate Mike Pence at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.
Although both men are experienced politicians, neither has a significant national profile.
Tonight's debate will be a chance for them to appeal to independent and undecided voters.
Mr Pence is currently Governor of Indiana and was previously a congressman, while Mr Kaine is a Senator from Virginia, and was previously governor of that state.
Both men are descendants of Irish immigrants and have spoken frequently of their Irish heritage and have visited Ireland recently.
Mr Pence's family hailed from Co Clare and Co Sligo. Mr Kaine has traced his roots to Co Longford.
Immigration reform is likely to be one focus of the debate, which on the whole is expected to feature more policy details than the Clinton-Trump debate last week.
Meanwhile, Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump will face each other again in St Louis, Missouri on Sunday.
Mr Trump is under fire after saying he "brilliantly used" US tax rules to his advantage in trying to limit the amount he paid in taxes.
