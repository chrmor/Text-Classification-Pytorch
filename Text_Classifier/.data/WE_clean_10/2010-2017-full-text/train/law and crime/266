'Underwear bomber' pleads guilty to attempted murder of 289 plane passengers
The so-called "underwear bomber" has pleaded guilty to trying to blow up a US-bound airliner on Christmas Day 2009, saying he had sought to avenge the killing of innocent Muslims.
In a six-minute speech to a shocked courtroom on Wednesday on the second day of his high profile-trial in Detroit, Michigan, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab insisted his actions were righteous and that the true crime was US foreign policy.
"I am guilty of this count in US law but not in the Koran," the 25-year-old Nigerian said as he confessed to trying to kill 289 people on a packed transatlantic airliner using explosives hidden in his underwear.
"The United States should be warned that if they continue and persist in promoting the blasphemy of Mohammed and the US continues to kill and support those who kill innocent Muslims then the US should await a great calamity through the hands of the Mujahedeen... or God."
