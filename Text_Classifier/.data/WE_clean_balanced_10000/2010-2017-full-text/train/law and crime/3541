Eighteen inmates were killed and a prison guard shot and wounded during a prison riot in north-eastern Brazil that ended on Tuesday, officials said.
The riot began on Monday in the Pedrinhas penitentiary complex in Maranhao state when prisoners overpowered and shot the guard during an inspection, and took him and another five guards hostage to demand better conditions.
Nine of the prisoners were murdered in score-settling by other convicts on Monday, and the other nine on Tuesday, the state secretary for security, Aluisio Guimarares, told AFP.
Media reports said several of the inmates killed were serving time for rape. Some were reportedly decapitated.
He added that police "have retaken control of the prison and calm has returned".
He said the wounded guard was released by the prisoners on Monday and was in a stable condition in hospital, and the other five guards were freed unharmed on Tuesday.
Prison riots are frequent in Brazil, where overcrowding of cells is common and gangs often run their wings.
Mr Guimeraes said this latest riot occurred in a high-security wing of the penitentiary which held 320 prisoners. The whole complex has an inmate population of 4,000 - twice its official capacity.
