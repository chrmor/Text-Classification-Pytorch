Danone of France to Buy WhiteWave in $10 Billion Deal to Bolster U.S. Portfolio
Danone, the French company that sells Stonyfield yogurt and Evian water, said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy the WhiteWave Foods Company — maker of Horizon Organic dairy products and Earthbound Farm salad greens, among other brands — for about $10 billion in cash.
The deal, aimed at enhancing the American profile of the company that makes Dannon and Activia yogurts, will significantly increase Danone’s presence in the lucrative organic foods market. Also, through WhiteWave’s ownership of the Silk brand of soy and nut milks, the purchase will give Danone a toehold in the flourishing market for plant-based dairy substitutes.
The acquisition underscores Danone’s determination to do a better job meeting the changing tastes of consumers, including by shifting aggressively toward the use of organic milk, which is more expensive than conventional.
Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone, said in a telephone interview that the company’s plans were comprehensive, from farm to table, and were influenced by shifting cultural attitudes and tastes.
