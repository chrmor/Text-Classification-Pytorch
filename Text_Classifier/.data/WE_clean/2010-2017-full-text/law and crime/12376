 A court ruling allowing Turkey to ban access to the anti-Islam film “Innocence of Muslims” that sparked outrage worldwide has been finalized, Transportation, Maritime and Communication Minister Binali Yıldırım said today. The ruling will now allow Turkish authorities to ban any webpage that shows any portion of the movie, including the video-sharing giant YouTube, according to Anatolia news agency. YouTube has refused to remove the trailer of the controversial movie, prompting countries like Pakistan and Sudan to ban the video-sharing site altogether. Yıldırım instructed his ministry yesterday to launch legal procedures to remove the anti-Islam movie from the Internet, according to a statement released by his website.
