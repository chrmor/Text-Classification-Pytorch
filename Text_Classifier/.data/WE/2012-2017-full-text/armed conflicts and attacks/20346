Five suspected militants killed in Balochistan&#39;s Sibi
Security forces on Tuesday claimed to have killed five suspected militants in Balochistan's Sibi district.
"Security forces also demolished three sanctuaries which were being used by the militants," said the spokesperson for the Frontier Corps (FC).
Personnel from the FC and a security agency conducted a joint operation in the Tali area of Sibi and five militants were killed in the exchange of fire, added the spokesperson.
Security forces also claimed to have recovered land mines and other weapons from the militant hideouts.
The spokesman stated that the militants were involved in a series of attacks on vital national installations, security forces and passenger trains.
Tali and surrounding areas considered to be sensitive areas of the Sibi district. Militants in the area have been attacking security forces and vital national installations for more than a decade.
Balochistan has been experiencing incidents of violence and targeted killings for over a decade. The largest province of the country by area, is home to a insurgency by ethnic Baloch separatists.
Al Qaeda-linked and sectarian militants also operate in the region. The province shares borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
