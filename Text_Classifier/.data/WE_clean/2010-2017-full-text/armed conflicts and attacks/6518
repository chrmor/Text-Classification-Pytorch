Officials Blame Branch of Al Qaeda for Bombing in Iraq
BAGHDAD â€” A suicide bomber attacked a police training center on Thursday in the predominantly Shiite city of Hilla, south of Baghdad, killing 25 people and wounding at least 75 in the second major bombing in Iraq this week.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials blamed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni insurgent group that has conducted dozens of attacks in the city in recent years, including several in which the police and security officials were targets.
The attack was the deadliest in Iraq since insurgents promised to increase violence in response to the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on Monday.
Coming after a bombing attack killed 10 people in a Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad on Tuesday, the violence underscored the continuing challenges for Iraqi security forces to secure the country as American forces withdraw by the end of the year.
Although there are far fewer attacks than at the height of the sectarian war in 2007, there are still bombings and assassinations virtually every day.
