The European XFEL is a unique facility that will open the door to new areas of science.”</p><p>Prof. Dr. Helmut Dosch, Chairman of the DESY Board of Directors, said: “What started as a vision and was set in motion at DESY more than 20 years ago has now become a reality: the world’s most powerful laser for X-ray light. Now scientists from around the world will conduct research at this most advanced high-speed camera for the nanocosmos in the world, and I wish them many exciting results – both fundamental and revolutionary.”</p><p>The European XFEL produces extremely bright and ultrashort light pulses. The facility will generate up to 27 000 pulses per second – 200 times more than other X-ray lasers. With the help of specialized instruments, these X-rays enable completely new insights into the atomic details and extremely fast processes of the nanoworld. Scientists will use these X-ray flashes to, for example, map the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules and other biological particles, and do so faster and with more detail than has ever been previously possible. Furthermore, single snapshots of particles produced with the X-ray laser can be sewn together to create “molecular movies” to study the progress of biochemical and chemical reactions – the basis for the development of new medicines and therapies or environmentally friendlier production methods and processes for extracting energy from sunlight. Other applications lie in the field of materials science with the development of new materials and substances, in the optimization of storage media for computers or the investigation of extreme matter conditions such as those found within exoplanets.</p><p>Prof. Dr. Andrei Fursenko, Aide to the President of the Russian Federation and former Research Minister, said: “This international research megaproject is our common intellectual contribution to the world of science. Many young people from different countries work on this project, which testifies that this project is designed for the future.”</p><p>The French Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Prof. Dr. Frédérique Vidal, said: “The European XFEL is a great illustration of Europe’s leading role in the international competition and of the know-how of its industrial players in building top-level scientific instruments. France and its European partners are fully engaged in reinforcing and developing large-scale research infrastructure and making it a shared goal in the construction of the European Research Area.”</p><p>Mayor Scholz said: “With the European XFEL, scientists will forge ahead into unknown worlds and help to find answers to questions facing humanity that will make life on our planet better. The European XFEL is a joint scientific project in the spirit of the Enlightenment and of international cooperation, and a promising example of European integration in action and of the success of European research funding.”</p><p>Scientists from across the world will come to European XFEL to do their research by applying for access to the instruments via a selection process. The assignment of the so-called beamtime, of generally one or two weeks per group and experiment, is awarded according to the scientific excellence of the submitted proposals.</p><p>Together with Minister Johanna Wanka, Hamburg’s First Mayor Olaf Scholz, and Schleswig Holstein’s Minister of Education, Science and Cultural Affairs Karin Prien, European XFEL Managing Director Robert Feidenhans’l greeted the first external researchers of the new international research facility on stage.
