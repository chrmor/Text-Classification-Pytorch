At least seven dead, 1,000 injured as heavy snow hits Japan
The heaviest snow in two decades has struck Tokyo and other areas across Japan, leaving at least seven people dead and more than 1,000 injured.
Up to 27 centimetres of snow was recorded in Tokyo by late Saturday, the heaviest fall in the capital for 45 years, according to meteorologists.
The storm hit Tokyo on the eve of its gubernatorial election. Observers say the heavy snowfall may affect voter turnout in the city of 13 million people.
As a depression moved along the Pacific coast on Saturday, the north-eastern city of Sendai saw 35 centimetres of snow, the heaviest in 78 years.
Local media said at least seven people have been killed in snow-linked accidents - mostly crashes after their cars skidded on icy roads.
In central Aichi prefecture, a 50-year-old man died after his car slipped on the icy road and rammed into an advertisement steel pole, a local rescuer said.
Public broadcaster NHK reported at least 1,051 people were injured across the country, many of whom had slipped on the ground or fallen while shovelling the snow off their roofs.
More than 20,000 households were without electricity, while airlines cancelled nearly 300 domestic flights a day after more than 740 flights were grounded.
Nearly 5,000 people were stranded at Narita airport on Saturday as traffic linking the airport to the capital was disrupted, NHK said.
Further snowfall is expected on Sunday in the northern part of the country, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
