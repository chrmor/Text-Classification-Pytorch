Tendulkar's 50th test century holds up Proteas
Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to score 50 test centuries as India held up South Africa's march toward victory on day four of the first test at Centurion on Sunday. Tendulkar pushed a drive through extra-cover for a single soon after tea to move to 100 not out off 197 balls and his landmark century.
The 37-year-old, who made his first test hundred as a 17-year-old against England in 1990, is now 11 centuries ahead of his closest competitor - Australia's Ricky Ponting. Tendulkar had reached 14 500 test runs in his 175th match when he went to 99 in the same over off Dale Steyn.
