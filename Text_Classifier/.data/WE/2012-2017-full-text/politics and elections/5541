Lebanese Leader Resigns Amid Sectarian Tensions
BEIRUTâ€”Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati resigned on Friday, effectively dissolving the government and thrusting the country into political uncertainty at a time when the conflict in Syria is sparking sectarian tensions here.
Mr. Mikati's departure stemmed from a dispute with the cabinet about naming a committee for upcoming parliamentary elections, and over extending the mandate of the Internal Security Forces chief, Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi.
