Acclaimed Australian author Peter Carey might have missed out the Booker Prize, but he has been shortlisted for America's National Book Awards.
Carey this week could have become the first author to win the Booker three times with his novel Parrot And Olivier In America, but he lost out to British comic writer Howard Jacobson.
Besides Carey, the nominees for the National Book Awards include such well-regarded authors as Nicole Krauss for Great House and Lionel Shriver for So Much For That.
Surprisingly, Jonathan Franzen's Freedom - the year's most highly-praised and talked about literary novel in the US - was not among the fiction finalists.
Jaimy Gordon's Lord of Misrule and Karen Tei Yamashita's I Hotel round out the fiction finalists.
Nominated in the non-fiction category is rock star Patti Smith for Just Kids, a memoir about her friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.
The winners will be announced on November 17.
