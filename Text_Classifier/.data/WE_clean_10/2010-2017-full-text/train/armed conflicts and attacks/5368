SEOUL, Sept. 16 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's spy agency has detained a North Korean defector for an alleged assassination attempt against a fellow defector acting as an anti-North Korean activist, an intelligence official said Friday. The suspect, identified by his last name Ahn in his 40s, was taken into custody for plotting to kill Park Sang-hak, who has led a high-profile campaign to send anti-Pyongyang leaflets into the North for years.
