Suicide Car Bomber Kills Eight in Somalia
At least eight Somalis were killed in the capital, Mogadishu, after a suicide car bomber rammed his car into a convoy carrying a delegation from Qatar.Officials say the visiting Qatari delegation, who were travelling in the interior minister's convoy, were not hurt in the blast and proceeded on to their hotel. The al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack which occurred in Mogadishu's central 'Kilometer 4' road junction.Despite losing much of their strongholds in central and southern Somalia to African and Somali government forces, al-Shabab militants continue to launch periodic attacks. Last month, more than 30 people were killed when al-Shabab fighters stormed the Supreme Court complex in Mogadishu.The government imposed a lockdown on the capital last week, closing streets and searching cars, because of alleged security threats.
