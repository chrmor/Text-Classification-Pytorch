Landslide kills six gold miners in Indonesia
AN official says a landslide on Indonesia's main island of Java has killed at least six gold miners.
Six other workers at the illegal mine are still missing after the landslide in West Java's district of Bogor.
Disaster management agency official Budi Aksomo said today several days of rain caused the landslide at the mountainous site yesterday.
He added that eight miners were found alive.
Rescuers are still evacuating the bodies from the scene and searching for the missing miners.
Seasonal downpours often cause landslides and flash floods in Indonesia, an archipelago nation where millions of people live on mountains or near fertile flood plains.
