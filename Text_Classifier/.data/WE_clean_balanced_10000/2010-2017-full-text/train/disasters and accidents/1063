Hurricane Tomas kills seven in Haiti
The Royal Navy ship HMS Manchester and a supply vessel, Wave Ruler, were due to arrive off the islands' coast on Saturday morning, ready to provide emergency support as heavy winds, thunderstorms and tornadoes battered the region.
"There is no doubt that Tomas should be taken seriously," said Gordon Wetherell, the governor of the Turks and Caicos.
In Haiti, which was largely spared a direct strike by the hurricane's 85mph core, aid agency officials said that the capital, Port au Prince, had escaped wholesale disaster though areas west of the city had suffered heavy flooding, landslides, structural destruction and the loss of crops.
"So far, we seem to have escaped the worst. We've been fortunate it will not be the catastrophic damage we had predicted for Port au Prince," said Nigel Fisher, head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti.
Several of the capital's tented camps and shantytowns, which house the majority of the 1.3 million people whose homes were wiped out in an earthquake ten months ago, were however awash with mud and floodwater, which President René Préval warned could be breeding a bigger threat.
"Now that, relatively speaking, Haiti has escaped the danger, we have to continue to be vigilant. You can end up surviving the storms, but dying of cholera," he said in a radio address from the presidential palace.
A cholera outbreak in Haiti has killed 442 people and infected nearly 6,000 in the last three weeks. The disease is spread through contaminated food and water and can spread quickly in floodwaters.
In Leogane, 20 miles west of Port au Prince, the local river burst its banks and poured through streets and flimsy shacks where families have been forced to shelter since the town was largely destroyed by the earthquake. People's possessions were washed into the streets and many families were forced to scramble to safety.
The National Hurricane Centre in Miami predicted that Tomas would lose strength on Saturday night after passing through the Turks and Caicos Islands and Bahamas carrying winds of around 75mph.
