Torrential rains cause widespread flooding in northern Italy
Little more than two weeks after Italian scientists warned that climate change had put much of the country at risk of flooding, parts of the northwest have been inundated by heavy rain.
Torrential downpours caused the Piedmont regionâ€™s Tanaro river to burst its banks, prompting local officials to ask the government to declare a state of emergency.
