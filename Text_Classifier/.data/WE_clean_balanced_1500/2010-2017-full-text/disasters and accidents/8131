The Indus River in southern Pakistan has breached flood defences, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.
The floodwaters have burst their banks near the southern city of Thatta.
Pakistani government officials have ordered the evacuation of more than 300,000 residents.
The roads leading out of the city have been congested with trucks, buses, cars and carts.
Pakistani army engineers are now trying to repair the flood barriers.
Some families from outlying areas who had taken refuge in Thatta now have to move again.
The United Nations says up to one million people have been forced to flee their homes in the past 48 hours.
United Nations officials say the disaster has now reached a magnitude of crisis beyond initial fears.
"An already colossal disaster is getting worse and requiring an even more colossal response," said UN spokesman Maurizio Giuliano.
"The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising.
"The floods seem determined to outrun our efforts. About one month from the onset of the floods, we don't know when we will see their end, as the disaster is still unfolding."
More rain is forecast in southern Pakistan over the weekend as the floodwaters flow towards the Arabian Sea.
In terms of surface area, Sindh is now the worst-affected province of the country. Out of its 23 districts, 19 have so far been ravaged by floods, a UN OCHA statement said Friday.
The United Nations has warned 800,000 people in desperate need of aid have been cut off by the deluge across the country and appealed for more helicopters to deliver supplies to those people reachable only by air.
