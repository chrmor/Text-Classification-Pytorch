Kerry legend Paidi O Se dies suddenly at the age of 57
Kerry football legend Paidi O Se has died suddenly at the age of 57.
The 10-time All-Ireland winner was found dead at his home in Ventry in county Kerry early on Saturday morning.
O Se was one of the most decorated players in the game, winning eight All-Irelands in the seventies and eighties and he also managed the Kingdom to All-Ireland titles in 1997 and 2000.
The five-time All Star winner led Westmeath to a Leinster title in 2004 and recently managed the Clare team.
O Se holds the distinction of both captaining and managing his county to All-Ireland success.
He won his first All-Ireland in 1975 and won four in a row from 1978 to 1981 and another three in a row in 1984 to 1986, when they beat Tyrone in the All-Ireland final.
He also won 11 Munster titles as a player and four league titles before retiring in 1987.
O Se managed Kerry from 1996 to 2003, winning six Munster titles and two All-Irelands in 1997 and 2000.
He is the uncle of Kerry stars Darragh, Tomas and Marc O Se.
He said: "there was hardly a person on the island of Ireland, never mind in the GAA, who did not recognise or know of Páidí Ó Sé, such was his contribution to the Association and to Irish life over a prolonged period".
"His excellence on the field of play in what was the greatest football team of all time still stands out to those of us who saw it and his passion for the game in no way ended with the completion of his playing days.
"He is one of the few people to have succeeded in claiming All-Ireland honours both as a manager and a player after a distinguished career that stretched far beyond his native Kerry.
"I extend my condolences to his wife Máire, his daughters Siún and Neasa, son Pádraig Óg, brother Tomás and the wider Ó Sé family, including his nephews Darragh, Tomás and Marc, all of whom followed his example in the green and gold of Kerry."
