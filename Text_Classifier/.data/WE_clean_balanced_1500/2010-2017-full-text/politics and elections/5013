Polish former deputy prime minister 'commits suicide'
"Police on the scene are investigating the circumstances of the incident, but all the indications are that we are dealing with suicide by hanging," said Mariusz Sokolowski, a police spokesman. "There is no evidence of the participation of a third party."
Janusz Maksymiuk, a former colleague, expressed his shock at the death and said that he had met Lepper on Thursday and had discussed plans for the future and there was "no sign that anything was wrong".
"Andrzej Lepper was a hard man. I can't imagine what would make him [commit suicide]," he told TVP television.
The death of the 57-year old brings a final end to a career of one of the most controversial and high-profile Polish politicians of the last 20 years.
A former boxer and pig-farmer, Andrzej Lepper rose to fame as the pugnacious leader of Self-Defence, a party professing to protect the rural poor. He gained both national and international fame for his strident and populist opposition to Polish membership of the European Union, once getting into trouble with the law by stopping a train carrying foreign grain and spilling the cargo onto the tracks.
At the height of his political power six years ago, Lepper came third in presidential elections, and Self Defence won 11 per cent of the vote in general elections to become the third biggest party on parliament.
A year later he became agriculture minister and deputy prime minister in a fractious and scandal-riddled coalition government.
His political career derailed when in December 2006 a party worker accused him of asking her for sexual favours in order to progress up the party ladder. In 2010, he was sentenced to two years and three months in prison after being found guilty of the offence but avoided jail by appealing against the verdict and the case was yet to return to the courts.
With his popularity on the wane his party was wiped out in general elections in 2007, thanks largely to the scandal.
