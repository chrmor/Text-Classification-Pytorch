Pope Francis Careful in Navigating Cuban Politics
HAVANA — Revolution Square is the political stage of revolutionary Cuba. Fidel Castro held huge rallies here to castigate the imperialists up north. Looming over the square are immense portraits of the revolutionaries Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos.
Into this charged atmosphere on Sunday came Pope Francis, celebrating an outdoor Mass attended by President Raúl Castro, the leadership of his Communist government and tens of thousands of Cubans. For those hoping Francis would speak about political freedom during his visit here, the moment seemed ripe.
And Francis did speak about politics. Colombian politics. He encouraged that country’s peace talks.
As for Cuban politics, Francis has so far spoken in what might be called pope code. At the plaza and other events on Sunday, as he did at the airport welcoming ceremony the day before, Francis refrained from any direct criticisms of the Cuban government but made the sort of oblique asides that could be interpreted as disapproval — or explained away as anything but.
