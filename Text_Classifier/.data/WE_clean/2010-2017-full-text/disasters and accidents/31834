Tsunami waves confirmed in Mexico, PTWC says
Following Thursday night's major earthquake off Mexico's southern coast, tsunami waves have been measured in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves of 3.3 feet above the tide level were measured off Salina Cruz. Smaller tsunami waves were observed on the coast or measured by ocean gauges in several other places.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the massive earthquake hit about 73 miles off Tres Picos, Mexico.
The tsunami center warned that hazardous waves were possible, reaching as high as 9 feet above the tide level. Waves as high as 3 feet were possible for Cook Island, Ecuador, French Polynesia, Guatemala and Kiribati.
Tsunami alerts also were issued for the west coast of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras and Ecuador.
The earthquake was felt as far inland as Mexico City, Sky News reported.                 
It was the strongest earthquake to hit Mexico since 1985.
