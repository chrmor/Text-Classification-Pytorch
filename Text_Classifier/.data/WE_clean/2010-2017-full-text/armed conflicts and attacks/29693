It is unknown if the ship was hit by a missile or by suicide attack after being rammed by a small boat, officials told Fox News.
The U.S. military was monitoring the situation. The Saudi frigate was able to continue her transit despite the damage, according to the official.
The attack came one day after President Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman.
Iran launched a ballistic missile Sunday in defiance of a U.N. resolution that ordered the Islamic Republic to stop such tests, U.S. officials revealed to Fox News.
In October, U.S. Navy warships came under missile attack by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the same area of the southern Red Sea just north of the Bab al Mandab Strait.
For the first time in history, a U.S. destroyer successfully shot down incoming enemy missiles using SM-2 missiles in the October attack.  
Days later Tomahawk cruise missile launched from the USS Nitze destroyed the Houthi radar installations responsible for firing on the U.S. warships.
