Gunman kills eight in bar in Cali, Colombia
BOGOTA (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire in a bar on Friday night in the Colombian city of Cali, killing eight people and wounding five in what police said appeared to have been a settling of scores between rival criminal gangs.
Cali police commander Colonel Hoover Pinilla said those targeted were members of a criminal gang in Colombiaâ€™s third largest city who had clashed with a rival group several weeks ago. An employee of the local prosecution service who was in the bar at the time was also killed, police said.
A 20-year-old man carrying a pistol was arrested fleeing the scene, police said on Saturday.
