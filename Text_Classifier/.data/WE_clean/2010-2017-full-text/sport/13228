IOC disqualifies four medallists from Athens 2004 following further analysis of stored samples
The four athletes are Yuriy Bilonog (1st, men’s shot put; Ukraine), Svetlana Krivelyova (3rd, women’s shot put; Russia), Ivan Tsikhan (2nd, men’s hammer throw; Belarus), and Iryna Yatchenko (3rd, women’s discus throw; Belarus).
In all four cases, the IOC Executive Board has ordered the relevant National Olympic Committees to return to the IOC, as soon as possible, the medals and diplomas awarded to the athletes.
The full decisions can be found via the following links:
In addition, the IOC notes that one pending case remains.
The IOC stores samples for eight years after each edition of the Games so they can be re-tested should more sophisticated detection methods become available or new substances be added to the list of banned substances.
The IOC, in close collaboration with the World Anti-Doping Agency, decided to further analyse a number of samples from the Athens Games as a result of targeted testing based on intelligence and new methods.
