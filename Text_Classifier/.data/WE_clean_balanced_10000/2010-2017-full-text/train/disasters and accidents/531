20 dead in bus crash in southern Mexico
VERACRUZ, Mexico (AP) â€” Mexican officials say 20 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge and fell into a deep gorge.
The head of the civil defense office in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz says the accident killed 20 of the 45 people on board. Yolanda Gutierrez said the bus was apparently carrying members of a soccer team when it skidded off a bridge on Sunday near the city of Cordoba.
The Veracruz state government said the bus was likely speeding, and the driver lost control when it went over a speed bump.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto expressed his condolences to the victims' families in his Twitter account. It was unclear if the driver survived.
There was no immediate information on the condition of the 25 injured.
