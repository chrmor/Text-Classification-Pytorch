More than 100 workers let go from disastrous Pike River coal mine in New Zealand
RECEIVERS for a New Zealand coal mine in which 29 men died last month have made 114 employees immediately redundant.
PricewaterhouseCoopers receiver John Fisk said there were sufficient funds to pay the workers the minimum required under New Zealand law, but there was some doubt over the payment of bonuses, the New Zealand Herald said.
