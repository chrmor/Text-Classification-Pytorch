13 Chicago-area deaths related to shoveling snow
At least 13 people have died in Cook and DuPage counties while shoveling “heart attack” snow during the recent blizzard, according to officials.
Ten of the deaths occurred in Cook County and three were reported in DuPage County, according to officials from county medical examiner and coroner offices.
Cook County announced that deaths occurred between about 6 p.m. Jan. 31 and 11:59 p.m. Feb 2 – the duration of the blizzard that left 19 inches of snow across much of northeastern Illinois.
Of the victims, nine were in their 60s, three were in their 50s and one was in his 40s. All but one of the victims were men.
The three victims in DuPage County were shoveling snow at their homes when they collapsed. They were taken to area hospitals and pronounced dead, said Charlie Dastych, the chief deputy coroner.
Nine of the Cook County victims died after shoveling snow and the 10 died after using a snow blower.
Much of the snow in the beginning and middle part of the blizzard was the heavy, wet snow sometimes referred to as “heart-attack snow.”
It wasn’t until later in the storm that the temperatures dropped and a less heavy layer coated what had already fallen.
The storm was the fifth largest in Chicago’s recorded history, according to weather officials.
