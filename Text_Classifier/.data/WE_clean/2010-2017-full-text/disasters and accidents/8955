The death toll from a powerful earthquake in south-eastern Turkey has risen to more than 200, with more than 1,000 people injured, officials say.
The magnitude 7.2 quake hit on Sunday morning (local time) near the provincial capital of Van and the region has since been hit by another magnitude 6 earthquake and several aftershocks.
It is the worst quake to hit Turkey in a decade.
Overnight, survivors and emergency workers battled to pull hundreds of people believed to be buried under debris in Van and the town of Ercis, where a student dormitory collapsed.
Residents in Van joined in a frantic search, using hands and shovels and working under floodlights and flashlights, hearing voices of people buried alive calling from under mounds of broken concrete in pitch darkness and freezing temperatures.
Up to 50 buildings have collapsed in the city and the Turkish military is reportedly on the way to help with the rescue operation.
More accounts of dead bodies and destruction emerged from smaller settlements across the remote area near the Iranian border, most of them left without electricity or phone access.
Turkey's interior minister Idris Naim Sahin, who is overseeing emergency operations in Ercis, says 117 people are confirmed dead in the town and 100 in Van city.
He says a total of 1,090 people are known to have been injured by the quake.
Officials say hundreds of people remain unaccounted for.
Prime minister Tayyip Erdogan travelled by helicopter to Van to see the scale of the disaster for himself.
He said the damage was worst in villages close to Van, where many buildings are made of mud bricks.
"I must say that almost all buildings in such villages are destroyed," Mr Erdogan told a nationally televised news conference.
Anatolian news agency reported that 200 prisoners escaped from Van's prison after the quake, but 50 returned after seeing their families.
In Van, a bustling and ancient city on a lake ringed by snow-capped mountains and with a population of 1 million, cranes were used to shift rubble of a crumpled six-storey apartment block where bystanders said 70 people were trapped.
"We heard cries and groaning from underneath the debris, we are waiting for the rescue teams to arrive," Halil Celik said as he stood beside the ruins of a building that had collapsed before his eyes.
"All of a sudden, a quake tore down the building in front of me. All the bystanders, we all ran to the building and rescued two injured people from the ruins."
At another site, three teenagers were believed trapped under a collapsed building. People clambered over the masonry, shouting: "Is there anyone there?"
A nurse at a public hospital in Ercis said hospital workers were attending the wounded in the hospital garden because the building was badly damaged.
"We can't count dead or injured because we're not inside the hospital," Eda Ekizoglu said.
"There should be more than 100 dead bodies left next to the hospital.
"We left them there because it's dark and we didn't want to step on bodies."
Prime Minister Julia Gillard says the Government is considering how it can help respond to the earthquake.
Ms Gillard says consular officials are still trying to work out whether any Australians have been caught up in the tragedy.
"To the best of my advise currently, we have not been notified of any Australian involvement, but our officials will continue to work very hard to get all of the information we need. As part of that, we will assess what we can do to assist," she said.
