Disaster declared in western Queensland
A disaster situation has been declared for the town of Mitchell in western Queensland, with flood levels predicted to hit nine metres.
Premier Anna Bligh says the declaration gives police and emergency service agencies the power to order people out of their homes if they refuse to go voluntarily.
"The situation at Mitchell, situated on the Maranoa River between Charleville and Roma, continues to be managed by local disaster management groups," the premier said.
"There is currently water in one property and the river continues to rise."
An emergency flood alert has been issued for Mitchell residents with people in low lying areas advised to consider self evacuation to higher ground or emergency centres.
Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said more heavy rain was expected across parts of inland Queensland today.
