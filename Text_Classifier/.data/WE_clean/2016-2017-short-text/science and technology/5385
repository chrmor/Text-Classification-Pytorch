University of Washington researchers report, in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology, the discovery of an odontoma — a benign tumor — in the fossil of a 255-million-year old Tanzanian mammal-like saber-toothed gorgonopsia. This is one of the oldest-known tumors ever found. (Reuters) (UPI) (JAMA)
