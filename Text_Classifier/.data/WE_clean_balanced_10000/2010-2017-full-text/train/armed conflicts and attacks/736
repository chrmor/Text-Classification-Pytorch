Syrian rebels released footage showing what they said was a regime helicopter being shot down in flames as UN chief Ban Ki-moon called for an independent inquiry into the latest grisly massacre in the war-torn country.
Videos released online showed a helicopter bursting into flames after apparently being hit by gunfire from the ground as rebels cheered.
The Free Syrian Army said the chopper was shot down as it attacked positions in the Damascus suburb of Qaboon, amid heavy fighting in the capital.
State television said the chopper came down near a mosque in Qaboon but gave no further information, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it believed it "was hit while it was being used in fighting nearby".
A rebel spokesman said the chopper was downed "in revenge for the Daraya massacre" and said the rebels had found the body of the pilot after the burning aircraft crashed to the ground.
His claims could not be independently verified.
Meanwhile Mr Ban called for an inquiry into the events in Daraya, where more than 300 bodies were reportedly found after government troops regained control of the town, just outside Damascus.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 334 bodies had been found after what activists described as brutal five-day onslaught of shelling, summary executions and house-to-house raids by pro-government forces.
Mr Ban's spokesman Martin Nesirky says he was shocked by reports of the massacre.
He called it an "appalling and brutal crime" and said it must be investigated "immediately, in an independent and impartial fashion".
The Syrian government says the town was "cleansed" of terrorist elements.
The White House called the reports the latest evidence of president Bashar al-Assad's "wanton disregard for human life".
Britain said it would be "an atrocity on a new scale" and the European Union said it was "totally unacceptable".
