When 60-year-old Julia regained consciousness on a street in central Poznan in 2016, she was lying in a puddle of water. Someone was sitting on top of her and people around her were shouting: “Let her be!” A few hours earlier she had left work to join a protest against a proposal for a near total ban on abortions in Poland, attending her first demonstration since the 1980s. Now, Julia did not know what had hit her - on the head, as it happens.
