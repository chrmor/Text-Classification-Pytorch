British police issue warning after chemical 'haze' on Sussex coast
(Reuters) - Police issued a warning on Sunday after chemical “haze” left up to 50 people on Britain’s south coast suffering irritation to their eyes and throats.
Sussex police urged people to keep doors and windows shut in the affected area, between the resort town of Eastbourne and Birling Gap, a few miles along the coast.
Police also warned people to stay away from the beaches, on a busy public holiday weekend.
The haze seems to have been coming in from the sea but the source has not been established, the statement said.
