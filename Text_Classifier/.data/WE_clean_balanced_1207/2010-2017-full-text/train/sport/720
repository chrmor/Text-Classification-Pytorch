2014 World Cup: Australia, Iran and South Korea qualify for Brazil
Australia, Iran and South Korea have all qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
The Socceroos sealed a place in their third consecutive World Cup with a 1-0 win over Iraq in Sydney to finish second behind Asian Football Confederation Group B winners Japan.
Reza Ghoochannejad's winner allowed Iran to beat South Korea 1-0 and top Group A with both countries qualifying.
The result meant South Korea stayed ahead of Uzbekistan on goal difference.
Uzbekistan's 5-1 victory over Qatar moved them to within one goal of South Korea, but the result was not enough to overtake them.
Uzbekistan will now meet Jordan in a two-legged play-off in September, with the winners going on to play the fifth-placed team from South America in November for a place at the World Cup.
Earlier, substitute Josh Kennedy's header with six minutes remaining was enough to book Australia's fourth appearance at the World Cup.
Kennedy, who had replaced Everton's Tim Cahill on 77 minutes, rose unchallenged to head Mark Bresciano's cross beyond goalkeeper Noor Sabri.
Japan had already won Asian Group B to qualify when they drew 1-1 with Australia on 4 June.
The Socceroos knew that a point would ensure qualification for the tournament in Brazil, which starts on 12 June 2014.
But they struggled to create throughout, Cahill failing to hit the target from three chances and looking unhappy when he was replaced with Kennedy by Socceroos coach Holger Osiek.
But the striker, who plays for Nagoya Grampus in Japan's J League, settled the nerves of the crowd of 80,000 to send his country through to their fourth World Cup finals.
