Trump Place buildings to go by 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard from now on
Three Trump Place buildings on the Upper West Side are changing their names to 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard this week, according to an email from landlord Equity Residential.
“The purpose of this change is to assume a neutral building identity that appeals to current and future tenants,” Equity Residential’s senior regional manager Mary Pawlisa wrote in an email to tenants, which was reviewed by The Real Deal. “Using The Street address for the building name is popular practice in NYC, and our well-known Riverside address makes it easy for visitors to locate the building.”
In October, residents at 160 Riverside Boulevard launched a petition to “dump the Trump name,” which quickly collected 241 signatures, according to a report.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether the three remaining Trump Place buildings, the condominiums at 120, 200 and 220 Riverside Boulevard, would also change their name. Residents at 220 Riverside had petitioned for a name change.
The name change highlights concerns that Donald Trump’s divisive political platform could impact his real estate brand. In October, the Trump Organization decided to drop the Trump name from a new line of hotels.
