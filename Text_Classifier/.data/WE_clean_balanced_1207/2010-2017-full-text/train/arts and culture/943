Broadcaster stirs race row New Zealand
A New Zealand broadcaster sparked a race row on Monday when he publicly questioned Prime Minister John Key about whether the country's ethnic minority governor general was a proper New Zealander.
TVNZ breakfast host Paul Henry challenged the credentials of Governor General Anand Satyanand - Queen Elizabeth II's representative in New Zealand - who was born in Auckland to Indo-Fijian parents.
"Is he even a New Zealander?" Henry asked as an uncomfortable Key tried to move the conversation on.
"Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time... Are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander?"
Satyanand's five-year term is about to come to an end, meaning Key will pick his successor.
Fuelling the row, state-owned TVNZ initially defended the presenter, saying: "The audience tell us over and over again that one of the things they love about Paul Henry is that he's prepared to say the things we quietly think but are scared to say out loud."
