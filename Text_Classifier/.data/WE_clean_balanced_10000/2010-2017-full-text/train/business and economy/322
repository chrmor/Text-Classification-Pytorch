Whole Foods to Pay $500K to Settle Overcharging Allegations in N.Y.
The Department of Consumer Affairs announced an investigation of Whole Foods in June after finding its New York City stores routinely overstated the weight of prepackaged meat, dairy and other goods.
The overcharges ranged from 80 cents for a package of pecan panko to $14.84 for a package of coconut shrimp, according to the agency, which tested 80 types of food and found that all of them had mislabeled weight.

The co-chief executives of Whole Foods, Walter Robb and John Mackey, subsequently apologized in a YouTube video, saying they "made some mistakes." The publicity that followed the probe hurt sales at the Austin, Texas-based chain.
As part of the settlement, the Department of Consumer Affairs said Whole Foods must conduct quarterly in-store audits at all its New York City stores.
If agency inspectors identify mislabled pre-packaged foods at a store, that store must immediately remove all mislabled products and Whole Foods must check the accuracy of pricing of that and 20 other products from the same department at all city stores, the department said.

Whole Foods must also implement and enforce policies preventing employees from estimating a package's weight and conduct training for employees involved in that process, the department said.
Whole Foods said in a statement that the Department of Consumer Affairs, in announcing the deal, had "misrepresented this agreement," saying the company had pre-existing programs that went "above and beyond" the agency's requirements.
Whole Foods said the settlement states that "there was no evidence of systematic or intentional misconduct by anyone in the Northeast region or the rest of the company."
