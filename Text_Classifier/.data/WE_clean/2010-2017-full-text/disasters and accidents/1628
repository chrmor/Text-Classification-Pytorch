Chile's trapped miners: rescue capsule arrives at San Jose mine
The first of three rescue capsules specially built to lift out the 33 Chilean miners trapped since early August has arrived at the San Jose mine.
Two backup rescue devices constructed at Chile's naval shipyard are expected to be delivered next week.
The man-size capsule will be used to pull the miners out one by one after the first of the three rescue holes being drilled reaches them. The government says that should happen by early November or sooner if all goes well.
Mining minister Laurence Golborne showed off the first capsule to relatives of the trapped miners yesterday.
Golborne and about a dozen family members tried out the capsule, a 924lb (420kg) tube made of steel mesh and sheets that is big enough to hold one person.
Carolina Lobos, the 25-year-old daughter of trapped miner Franklin Lobos, said the device seemed very small and confining when she first saw it. After trying it out, she called it comfortable. "It's very exciting," she added.
The capsule is nearly 10ft (3 metres) tall on the outside. Inside, the space is 6¼ft (1.9m) high and about 21in (53cm) across.
The bottom of the capsule holds three tanks of compressed air – 40% oxygen and 60% nitrogen, health minister Jaime Manalich said. He said that was enough for about 90 minutes of breathing, more than the 15 to 20 minutes that the journey to the surface is expected to take.
A microphone inside will allow each miner to stay in touch with those inside and outside the mine while being pulled up, Manalich said.
He added that in an emergency, such as the capsule getting jammed in the rescue hole, the bottom can be opened with levers inside so the miner can be lowered back down by cable.
