It's official: Magnus Carlsen is number one!
Magnus Carlsen gained nine rating points in his last sixteen games to come in at 2810 Elo points and to occupy the number one slot in the world rankings. Below is this prodigy's rating progress in the last nine years.
In second place is Bulgarian GM Veselin Topalov, who lost five points in four games (at the European Team Championships in Novi Sad), followed by World Champion Viswanathan Anand, who lost two points in nine games. Vladimir Kramnik is number four, having won a whopping sixteen points in sixteen games. Kramnik displaced Levon Aronian, who lost five points and is now in place five in the world rankings.
Other notatble changes at the top: Vassily Ivanchuk has gained ten points and is once again in the top ten. So is Chinese GM Wang Yue, who gained fifteen points. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov gained 22 points, while Peter Leko lost 13, Teimour Radjabov 15 and Alexander Morozevich 18 points.
Nothing has changed: Judit Polgar is still almost 70 points ahead of her nearest rival, Indian GM Koneru Humpy. Chinese wonder talent Hou Yifan continues to move slowly towards the 2600 mark and we can expect her to soon be the third female player in history to achive this.
Magnus is of course number one in this list too. The number two slot has been taken away from Sergey Karjakin by French GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, without any other notable changes occurring in the top rankings.
Hou Yifan and Anna Muzychuk remain in the lead, Ukrainian GM Kateryna Lahno has overtaken Chinese WGM Ju Wenjun to occupy third place. There are six Russians, five Chinese girls and three Indians in this list.
