Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte suspends 'war on drugs' so he can hunt down corrupt police officers instead 
His police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, has faced pressure to resign, but instead he said that anti-drugs units would be temporarily dissolved, to rid them of “scalawags”.
“We will cleanse our ranks..then maybe after that, we can resume our war on drugs. The president told us to clean the organisation first,” said Dela Rosa.
“I don’t know how long it will take to cleanse the PNP [Philippines National Police]. But with each and every one of us cooperating, helping each other, maybe in a month we can do it.”
Duterte has come under growing international criticism for the brutality of the war on drugs. After entering office saying he would “be happy to slaughter” millions of Fillipino drug users and peddlers, he has been accused of instigating a wave of uncontrolled violence.
Thousands of victims, from among the Philippines’ poorest classes, have been murdered by unidentified hit squads. Many of the masked assassins are believed to be linked to the police, a charge the force strongly denies.
