36 dead, dozens hurt as tropical storms clobber Bangladesh
Separate tropical storms that have swept through parts of Bangladesh have left at least 36 people dead and scores injured.
Media reports Monday said that the casualties have been recorded since Saturday and that most deaths took place in the northern district of Bogra.
The Bengali-language Prothom Alo newspaper reported that at least 20 people died in Bogra while five people died in Dhaka and the rest in other northern areas as well as in the southwest of the country.
The newspaper says the storms have also uprooted trees, damaged electricity distribution lines, while hundreds of homes, shops and schools have been flattened in parts of the South Asian nation.
Bangladesh usually experiences such storms and tornadoes in April as the summer approaches.
