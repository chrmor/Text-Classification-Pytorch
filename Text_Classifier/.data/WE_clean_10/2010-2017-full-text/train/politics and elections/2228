Six ministers to change in Egypt cabinet reshuffle: state paper
CAIRO (Reuters) - A limited cabinet reshuffle will see six ministers replaced in Egypt, state newspaper al-Ahram said on Thursday, citing government sources.
The new ministers, who could swear oath on Tuesday, are expected to be those of justice, legal and prosecution affairs, culture, agriculture, planning and international cooperation, and one of the economic portfolio ministries, al-Ahram said, without naming the candidates.
The reshuffle is seen as an attempt by President Mohamed Mursi, who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood group, to ease tensions with opponents that flared in November after a controversial presidential decree expanded his powers.
Political stability would help Egypt secure a much-needed $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the country failed this month to conclude a deal.
Prime Minister Hisham Kandil, widely criticized as colorless and ineffectual, will keep his job in the limited reshuffle, a presidential spokesman said last week.
Al-Ahram said on Thursday that a movement of governors also expected will see senior-ranking members of the Brotherhood heading 5 governorates, including Alexandria and Giza.
