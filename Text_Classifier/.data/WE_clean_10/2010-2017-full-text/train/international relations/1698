Berlusconi-Putin ties set off US alarm bells
ITALIAN Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has flown to the Black Sea resort of Sochi where, according to a Moscow report, he had unscheduled talks with Russian PM Vladimir Putin.
The change to Mr Berlusconi's plans was signalled just hours after the publication of US diplomatic cables alleging that he and Mr Putin had a secret business association in addition to their known personal and political links - something both men deny.
The release of the cables by WikiLeaks deepened the crisis surrounding Mr Berlusconi's government, which faces a motion of no confidence on December 14.
The cables reveal that the friendship between Russia's macho man and Italy's septuagenarian Lothario has emerged as a major source of US anxiety.
The cables suggest Mr Berlusconi's negotiation of generous conditions for the Italian oil and energy giant Eni with the Russian firm Gazprom has resulted in the Italian leader supporting Russian energy projects rather than those of Western nations.
