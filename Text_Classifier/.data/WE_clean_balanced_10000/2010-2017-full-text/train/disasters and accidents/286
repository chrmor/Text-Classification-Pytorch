Fatal fire on Indonesian ferry
At least 11 people were killed aafter fire broke out soon after ferry left Merak port on Java island for neighbouring Sumatra
A crowded ferry caught fire in Indonesia early today, killing at least 11 people and sending panicked passengers jumping into the sea, officials said. Nearly 200 people were injured, some critically.
Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for the Transportation Ministry, said the fire broke out at around 3am, soon after the ferry left Merak port on Java island for neighbouring Sumatra. Five rescue ships rushed to the scene.
By late morning, they had carried 427 people to safety, said Wiratno, another ministry official, adding that no one else appeared to be trapped inside.
Footage on MetroTV showed plumes of black clouds shooting from the ferry, which was also carrying dozens of cars and trucks packed with cargo.
Survivors said the blaze was sparked by a truck driver who threw his cigarette butt onto the ground.
Roland, a doctor at one of several hospitals treating victims, said 11 bodies had been recovered.
Ferries are a main source of transportation in Indonesia, an archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands and 235 million people.
Accidents are common due to overcrowding and poor safety standards.
