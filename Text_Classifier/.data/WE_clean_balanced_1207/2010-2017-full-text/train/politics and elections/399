Elections fiasco: Judge allows suit vs. Secretary of State
PHOENIX - A Maricopa County judge Monday allowed a lawsuit stemming from Arizona's presidential preference election debacle to proceed against Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan.
Judge David Gass dismissed a request from the Arizona attorney general's office to throw out the case.
A court challenge prompted by major polling problems during the March primary is the subject of a hearing with testimony expected from experts and voters who allege they couldn't cast ballots.
Tucson resident John Brakey sued Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan and all 15 counties after the March 22 election. He contends long lines in Maricopa County suppressed the vote and statewide voter registrations problems led to illegal vote counts. He wants the results decertified.
The attorney general says the presidential primary results can't be challenged and Brakey can't show the results would change if the contest was allowed.
