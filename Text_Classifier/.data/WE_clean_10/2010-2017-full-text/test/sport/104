Russia Files Appeal Against Doping Ban From Olympic Athletics
The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) says it has appealed a ban of its track-and-field team from next month's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro over doping. ROC spokesman Konstantin Vybornov told AP on July 3 that a case had been filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport and would be heard on July 19. ROC's legal department head, Aleksandra Brilliantova, told the TASS news agency that if Russia wins, the Olympic application deadline "will be extended" to let Russian athletes apply. The case is being brought jointly by the ROC and dozens of top Russian athletes. The IAAF, track's world governing body, suspended Russia in November after a World Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread, state-sponsored doping in Russian track and field.
The ban was upheld by the IAAF in a vote last month.
