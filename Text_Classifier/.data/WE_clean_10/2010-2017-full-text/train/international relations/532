Toronto teen deported to Mexico, CBSA confirms
Canada Border Services Agency has confirmed an 18-year-old Toronto student has been deported to Mexico despite fears from his supporters he could be a target for violence.
Agency spokeswoman Anna Pape says Daniel Garcia was put on a plane Saturday morning.
MR. Garcia's lawyer, Joel Sandaluk, said Sunday morning he still had not been officially informed by the agency that his client was removed from the country.
He said Mr. Garcia's only recourse would be for Immigration Minister Jason Kenney to issue a temporary resident's permit.
The request was put to the minister only days ago.
Mr. Garcia's classmates and other supporters had waged a public campaign to try to persuade Canadian officials to let the teenager remain in Canada.
"This type of decision is never taken lightly," said Mr. Pape.
"But once a person has exhausted all legal mechanisms to remain in Canada, we're legislatively mandated to enforce it," she added.
Federal Court Justice Daniele Tremblay-Lamer rejected Mr. Garcia's application for temporary stay on Friday, saying he had showed a "complete disregard for Canada's immigration laws."
Mr. Garcia had failed to appear for removal in April, disobeyed conditions of his release when he moved, and failed to report a change of address in October.
The teenager came to Canada three years ago with his older sister Brenda, who is gay.
Brenda Garcia's partner was murdered one night in Mexico while her brother was in the room, the teenager's supporters say.
They feared he would be attacked because of his sister's sexuality if he was returned to Mexico.
