Kazan Fire Death Toll Rises
The death toll from a fire at a shopping center in the Russian city of Kazan was raised to 17 on March 14 after emergency workers found more bodies amid the debris.
News agencies quoted the head of the regional rescue center, Igor Panshin, as saying that the latest victim is most likely a man. Fire raced through the Admiral shopping complex in the capital of Russia's Tatarstan region on March 11.
At least 55 people were injured, including two police officers and two emergency workers, as a result of the blaze and partial collapse of the three-story shopping complex.
Earlier, a spokesman for Tajikistan's Labor and Migration Board in Russia, Ibrohim Ahmadov, told RFE/RL that at least five of the dead victims were Tajik citizens.
