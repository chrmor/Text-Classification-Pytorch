Irish PM quits as party leader
Ireland's embattled Prime Minister Brian Cowen announced Saturday he was stepping down as leader of his Fianna Fail party but would remain as the country's premier ahead of the March 11 general election.
In a surprise move after a week of political turmoil, Cowen said he wanted the centrist party to fight the election "free from internal distractions" -- while he could now focus on getting budget laws passed to cement an EU-IMF bailout to revive Ireland's battered economy.
"Taking everything into account, and having discussed the matter with my family, I have decided on my own counsel to step down as uachtarain (president) of Fianna Fail and leader of Fianna Fail," Cowen told a Dublin news conference.
Despite surviving a confidence vote among his party's lawmakers on Tuesday, Cowen's authority was seriously damaged by a botched cabinet reshuffle that sparked the anger of his junior coalition partners and forced him to announce an election date.
He expressed his intention to stay on as premier until the poll, saying: "I will continue in my role as Taoiseach (prime minister) as I have before."
He said he would focus on passing the Finance Bill, which includes a series of measures crucial to securing the 67-billion-euro (90-billion-dollar) bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
