Asteroid DA14 Facts: Feb. 15 Space Rock's Size, Speed, Proximity & More (SLIDESHOW)
Even though there's no chance that the asteroid known as DA14 will hit earth on Feb. 15, that doesn't mean you should ignore it.
The flyby, in which the massive space rock will come within 17,200 miles of our planet, is a unique event, and we've compiled a slideshow of essential information about it.
You may have heard that the White House-sized asteroid will whiz by the earth faster than a speeding bullet, but did you that it will come closer to our planet than many orbiting satellites? What about how it's planning a return trip later this century? And what would happen -- hypothetically -- if an asteroid the size of DA14 really did hit?
If you're in Europe, Asia, Africa or Australia, all you'll need to see DA14 pass by earth is a pair of strong binoculars. Skywatchers can view the flyby in Europe and Africa on the night of Feb. 15, and in Asia and Australia on the morning of Feb. 16. Enthusiasts in the Americas won't be able to see the flyby live, but click through the slideshow to find out where and how you can watch a live stream.
Editor's Note: The DA14 flyby is unrelated to the meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on Feb. 15, according to NASA.
