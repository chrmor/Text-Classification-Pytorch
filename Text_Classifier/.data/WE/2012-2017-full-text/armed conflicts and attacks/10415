Israel and Hamas Resume Fighting in Gaza
GAZA CITY, Gaza — Despite a 24-hour cease-fire proposal, Israel and Hamas continued launching attacks Sunday, adding over a dozen fatalities to the sky-high death-toll accrued in nearly three-weeks of conflict.
Hamas asked for a cease-fire hours after Israel resumed attacks on the enclave, but 494 rockets were launched at Israel, including nine intercepted by Iron Dome, officials said.
“Hamas is suggesting the cease-fire and believe it or not … they've even violated their own cease-fire,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army launched more than 40 attacks on the Gaza strip Sunday, killing 15 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. More than 1,030 Palestinians have died in the course of the 20-day confrontation, while 46 Israelis have been killed.
International leaders had hoped that a temporary truce on Saturday could be extended through Sunday. U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon “urges, in the strongest terms, both the Israelis and Palestinians to extend, for an additional 24 hours, the humanitarian cease-fire that was in effect and mostly observed until early this morning,” his spokesperson said.
