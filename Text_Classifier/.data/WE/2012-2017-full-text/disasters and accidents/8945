Measles from Philippines spreading in Canada
MANILA, Philippine - While the measles outbreak in the Philippines is already stemmed, Canada is just beginning to experience the viral disease.
Canada is only the latest country to have reported measles transmissions. Australia, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have also reported that measles from the Philippines have spread to their countries.
Health officials in Toronto, Canada on Tuesday warned residents and medical professionals to be on alert for the measles contagion, which affected mostly young Filipinos in the latter part of 2013.
"Measles remains rare in Toronto, but clinicians are reminded of the continued risk of importation and further spread," the Toronto Public Health surveillance alert stated as reported by Canada's The Star.
There are six reported measles cases in the North American country so far since the start of the year. All patients caught the disease during their visit in the Philippines.
In the Philippines, over 13 million children have been vaccinated by the Department of Health. Last year, over 1,700 measles cases were recorded, including 21 deaths.
The Canadian health bureau advised clinicians to protect their patients using two doses of measles-containing vaccine.
"This remains the best protection against infection with measles," it said.
