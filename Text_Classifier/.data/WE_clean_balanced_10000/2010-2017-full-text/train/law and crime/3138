Court casts doubts over legality of offshore processing of asylum seekers
The validity of Australia's controversial offshore processing of asylum seekers has been thrown into doubt after a court found fundamental errors of law in the system.
The High Court has today ruled that two Sri Lankan boat arrivals were denied "procedural fairness" in the review of their rejected refugee status claims.
The unanimous judgment by the seven judges, handed down this morning, found those reviewing refugee determinations were bound to act within Australian law. Currently, those who seek asylum in Australia by boat are denied access to Australian courts.
The full impact of the decision and what implications it might have for the operations of the offshore detention system are still being assessed.
