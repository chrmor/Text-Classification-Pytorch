The Queen will arrive in Canberra this evening for what may be her last official tour of Australia.
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip will be in Australia to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Perth later in the month.
It is the Queen's 16th visit to Australia and she is set to be welcomed after her 6:00pm touchdown at Fairbairn Airport by the official party and Canberra school children.
But the 85-year-old monarch is taking the time for some official engagements in Canberra, where she will spend the bulk of the visit.
That includes audiences with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Governor General Quentin Bryce, and Opposition leader Tony Abbott.
But there will also be time for public engagements including a visit to the Australian war memorial, a visit to the Floriade Flower Festival, and a cruise on Lake Burley Griffin.
The Royal couple will also make a trip to Brisbane for a reception with people affected by the summer floods and cyclone, before visiting Melbourne
Prince Phillip will attend some events of his own, including a Duke of Edinburgh award reception.
