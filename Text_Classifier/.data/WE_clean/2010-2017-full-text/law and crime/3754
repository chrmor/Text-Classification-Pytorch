Rwandan Hutu leader ordered to Hague court
PARIS, Jan. 5 (UPI) -- A Rwandan Hutu leader arrested in France must be transferred to the International Criminal Court for a war crimes trial, a French court has ruled.
Appeals by Callixte Mbarushimana, executive secretary of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda Hutu guerrilla movement, against his detention and transfer to the Hague were rejected Tuesday, Radio France Internationale reported.
The ICC accuses Mbarushimana of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, torture and rape, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2009, when U.N.-backed Congolese and Rwandan forces attacked his army.
Mbarushimana has been living in France as a political refugee since 2002, but was charged in December with crimes against humanity by his movement.
"There are many political elements," said Phillipe Greciano, his lawyer. "Mr. Mbarushimana is a French refugee. The International Criminal Court is not defending the human rights of Mr. Mbarushimana. We don't have evidence Mr. Mbarushimana is involved in those crimes."
