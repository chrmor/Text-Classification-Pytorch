News Corp. in $139 Million Settlement With Shareholders
As News Corporation continues to negotiate settlements with victims of a phone-hacking scandal within its British newspaper division, its board on Monday reached a $139 million settlement with a group of United States shareholders.
The group had asserted that News Corporation’s board — led by Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive — breached its fiduciary responsibility in handling the crisis in Britain.
The lawsuit also asserted that the company unethically paid $670 million in 2011 to acquire the Shine Group, the television production company of Mr. Murdoch’s daughter, Elisabeth Murdoch.
The suit was filed by Amalgamated Bank, the largest union-owned bank in the United States, which handles large-scale labor and pension funds.
News Corporation will not pay any of the $139 million settlement. Rather, the company will receive a payment from insurance that protects corporate boards from this type of litigation.
