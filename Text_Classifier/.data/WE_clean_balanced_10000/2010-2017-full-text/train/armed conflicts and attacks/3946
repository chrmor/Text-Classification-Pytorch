Mosque bomber a Saudi
Kuwait: Thousands of people in Kuwait have taken part in a mass funeral procession for 27 people killed in a suicide bombing that targeted a Shi'ite mosque.
Kuwait has identified the suicide bomber who carried out the country's worst terrorist attack as a Saudi citizen, Kuwait state media reported on Sunday. The interior ministry named the bomber as Fahd Suliman Abdul-Muhsen al-Qabaa and said he flew into Kuwait's airport at dawn on Friday, only hours before he detonated explosives at the mosque.
Police said on Saturday they are interrogating a number of suspects with possible links to the suicide bombing, which was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
An Interior Ministry statement on Saturday said police arrested the owner of the car that was used by the bomber to drive to the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait City, where he detonated his device inside the mosque, among the worshippers. Police did not say how many suspects were being questioned.
