150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address
When president Abraham Lincoln dedicated a cemetery on the Gettysburg battlefield 150 years ago on Tuesday, the US had already been at war with itself for almost three years. The nation would fight on for another 18 months, and by then almost a million people would be dead or wounded.
''The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here,'' Lincoln told a crowd of 20,000 or so that afternoon.
He was only half-right. Gettysburg would become elemental to America's understanding of itself, but so too would Lincoln's address - 270 (or so) words in three paragraphs, now considered to be one of the great political speeches.
Of all the commemorations of the address being held this week, including those on the battlefield and by the Library of Congress, perhaps the most captivating is a project led by the documentary maker Ken Burns, famous for his series The Civil War, who is seeking to have every American record themselves reciting the speech.
Thousands have already taken part, including George W. Bush, who recites what is known as the Everett copy of the address, and Barack Obama, who uses just 106 seconds to recite the Nicolay copy. It is said that Lincoln, who was interrupted for applause, spoke for three minutes.
