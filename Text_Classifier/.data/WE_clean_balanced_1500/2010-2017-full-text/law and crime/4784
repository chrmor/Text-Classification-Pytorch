Rolf Harris stripped of Order of Australia honours by the Governor-General
Entertainer Rolf Harris has been stripped of his Order of Australia honours, after being jailed for child sex offences.
Harris, 84, was sentenced to five years and nine months in jail in July last year, after being found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986.
The London jury took eight days to deliver unanimous verdicts on all 12 charges of indecent assault.
Harris lodged an appeal in August, but in October a judge rejected Harris's application for his appeal to be heard.
The Australian entertainer had 28 days to ask for a hearing before three judges, but Harris abandoned his appeal bid, and the UK Judiciary Office confirmed he had not lodged an application in time and had not requested an extension.
Earlier this month there were reports Harris had been questioned by British police over further allegations of sexual offences.
The Governor-General has now terminated Harris' appointments of Officer and Member of the Order of Australia in the General Division.
