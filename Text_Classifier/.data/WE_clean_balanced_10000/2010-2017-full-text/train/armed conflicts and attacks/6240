Regime missiles strike southern Damascus, activists say
Two surface-to-surface missiles hit southern areas of the Syrian capital on Tuesday evening causing casualties, activists said.
The anti-regime Sham News Network said that the missiles hit “near the [Palestinian] Yarmouk Refugee Camp’s 30th Street.”
Meanwhile, the activist Local Coordination Committee reported that “a surface-to-surface missile landed in the Jourat Shreibaty neighborhood” of Damascus, which is near the Yarmouk Camp.
It added that at least one person was killed and many others wounded in the missile attacks.
The group reported earlier in the evening that “the sound of a massive explosion shook most southern areas of the capital and smoke was rising over [Damascus].”
The LCC also posted a video online showing a large column of smoke purportedly rising from the area following a missile strike.
Another video posted online alleges to show smoke rising following a second missile strike.
However, there was no independent confirmation of the videos or whether surface-to-surface missiles had been fired.
The Syrian regime in past months has fired a number of Scud ballistic missiles at rebel-held areas in the north of a country.
