Afghanistan is back on Gillard's agenda
The death of another Australian soldier has put Afghanistan back in mournful focus for Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
Defence announced on Saturday Perth-based SAS Trooper Jason Brown was killed overnight on Friday in northern Kandahar, shot multiple times by Taliban fighters.
Ms Gillard held an immediate press conference on arriving in northern NSW, where she was set to announce a scheme which would see farmers receive credits for planting trees to store pollution in local and international markets.
Early in the election campaign, the prime minister attended the funeral of Private Nathan Bewes, who was killed in Afghanistan, but the conflict has not been a strong focus during the election.
As the prime minister, it was devastating to receive the news of the death of another Australian soldier, the 18th to die during the mission, Ms Gillard said.
"I feel the weight of that... it is always difficult to hear that news," she told reporters on Saturday.
