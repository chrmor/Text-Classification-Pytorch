Lagarde Expected to Seek I.M.F. Job
PARIS — Europe’s top candidate to lead the International Monetary Fund, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde of France, is expected to formally announce her bid for the post at a news conference scheduled in Paris on Wednesday.
Ms. Lagarde has been focusing intently on her candidacy in recent days, a French government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday. She scheduled the news conference late on Tuesday without confirming the topic.
Since Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned last week to fight charges that he sexually assaulted a maid in a New York hotel, Ms. Lagarde has emerged as a front-runner to succeed him, having won support from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the British chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, and most of Europe’s political establishment.
But the maneuvering to keep a European in a post the Continent has held for more than 40 years has touched off criticism from leaders of emerging markets and other countries, which have sought to promote strong candidates of their own in recent days.
Leaders of countries like Brazil, Mexico and China say just giving the job to another European is no longer defensible when fast-growing economies are outpacing the West, and such a move could undermine the fund’s credibility. They want a more open process that could place an official from one of their countries in the post for the first time. Unlike Europe, however, the emerging-market countries are not speaking with a single voice.
Nominations for the I.M.F. post must be submitted by June 10. The I.M.F. wants to pick a new leader by June 30, a rapid timetable that would help get the I.M.F. back on track to deal with a growing debt crisis in Europe.
