Two dead in 100-car South Korea pile-up
At least two people have been killed in a pile-up involving about 100 cars on a bridge near South Korea's Incheon International Airport.
Another 42 people were injured in the incident, eight of them seriously, the Yonhap news agency reports.
The cause is not clear, but police said initial reports suggested a bus had hit the back of a car in foggy conditions.
The bridge connects Incheon and the capital, Seoul, to the airport on Yongjing island.
The pile-up occurred at about 09:30 local time (00:30 GMT). Authorities said icy roads were also a factor.
TV footage showed emergency rescue workers trying to get to a mass of twisted and crumpled vehicles on the fog-covered bridge.
"I heard a series of bangs in front of me. Then I was rear-ended by a following car," cab driver Yoo Sang-young told the Yonhap news agency. "I felt my car turning around and hitting a protection rail. I then lost consciousness."
Another driver said he could not see ahead of him in the thick fog.
"I slowed down but still rammed into the cars piled up in front of me," he said.
The Seoul-bound side of the bridge and a number of lanes in the other direction have been shut down.
But the Associated Press news agency quoted police official Park Sang-yeoul as saying the damaged cars had now been removed from the cross-sea bridge.
