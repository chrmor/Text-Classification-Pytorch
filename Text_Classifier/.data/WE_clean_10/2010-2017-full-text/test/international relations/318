Obama, in Laos, Pledges $90 Million to Clear Unexploded Ordnance
Obama is one of several world leaders arriving for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Taking its turn as the chair of the regional forum, the Laos' communist government is seizing a rare moment in the spotlight.
For Obama, the visit serves as a capstone to his yearslong effort to bolster relations with Southeast Asian countries long overlooked by the United States. The outreach is a core element of Obama's attempt to shift U.S. diplomatic and military resources away from the Middle East and into Asia in order to counter China's dominance in the region and ensure a foothold in growing markets.
Obama's project — dubbed his Asia pivot — has yielded uneven results, as conflict in the Middle East has continued to demand attention and China has bristled at what it views as meddling in its backyard.
Obama said America's interest in the Asia-Pacific isn't new and is not a passing fad.
"The United States is more deeply engaged across the Asia-Pacific than we have been in decades," Obama said. "Our position is stronger and we've sent a clear message that as a Pacific nation, we are here to stay."
With just four months left in office and eyeing his legacy, Obama used the moment to reassert his aims. He touted new military aid and U.S. support for regional cooperation in addressing maritime disputes. He made a plug for the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, the policy's central economic component that is now stuck in Congress. He sought to address worries that United States' new focus on Asia will leave smaller nations as pawns in a chess match between the U.S. and China.
"We believe that bigger nations should not dictate to smaller nations and that all nations should play by the same rules," he said.
As a first sign of a new relationship with Laos, Obama said his administration would address the legacy of war. Obama announced he would double spending for unexploded ordnance — committing $90 million over the three years. The U.S. has contributed $100 million to the effort in the last 20 years, as annual deaths have fallen from more than 300 to fewer than 50, the White House said.
The Lao government said it would increase efforts to recover remains and account for Americans missing since the Vietnam War.
As he opened a day of ceremony and diplomacy, Obama was greeted by a military band, traditional dancers and a warm, tropical rain. He met with Lao President Bounnhang Vorachit, was feted at a welcome banqueted, where he toasted to a relationship he said would "mean greater progress and opportunity for the people of Laos."
Obama's outreach to those regional powers hit a snag just as he arrived in the region from China. The White House called off a planned meeting Tuesday with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, after the brash new leader referred to Obama as a "son of a b****."
Duterte, who had been expecting Obama to criticize his deadly, extrajudicial crackdown on drug dealers, later said he regretted the personal attack on the president.
