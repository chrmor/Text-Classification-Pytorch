Belgian soldiers and police 'held orgy' during Brussels lockdown
Two policewomen and eight soldiers alleged to have engaged in group sex while colleagues hunted for Paris terror attack suspects
Soldiers and police officers in Brussels held an orgy while the city was in lockdown over fears of a Paris-style attack by Islamist extremists, according to Belgian media reports.
Two female police officers and eight soldiers are said to have engaged in group sex at a police station in the Brussels neighbourhood of Ganshoren while colleagues hunted for terror suspects.
The police station was near Molenbeek, where anti-terror raids had been taking place.
Police spokesman Johan Berckmans told De Standaard that 15 to 20 soldiers slept at the station for two weeks during the operation in November so they did not have to travel far at the end of their shift.
“When they left, they organised a small party to thank the police in the area,” the spokesman told Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure.
“We have launched an investigation to find out what exactly happened.”
The Belgian capital was on the highest level of alert last month after the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead. At least three of the nine men suspected of carrying out the attacks were based in Brussels.
The lockdown saw shops, schools and offices shut for days, public transport restricted, museums and theatres closed, seasonal markets cancelled, and thousands of armed police and soldiers in the streets.
