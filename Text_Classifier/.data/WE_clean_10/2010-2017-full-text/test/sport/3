UConn’s Win Isn’t Pretty, but Title Is a Perfect 10th for Geno Auriemma
The rivalry was restored in December, with Connecticut rallying from an early 10-point deficit to win by 18, though in that game the Irish were without Brianna Turner, an athletic 6-3 forward, who struggled with nerves in the first half Tuesday but became an inside force and led Coach Muffet McGraw’s team with 14 points and 10 rebounds.
“You know, we have a really good relationship,” McGraw said. “I think that both being from Philly, we just share some sort of bond.”
Beyond the bond was a shared benefit of maintaining a united front at the top of the food chain. In the aftermath of the now-dated fallout between Connecticut and Tennessee and the discontinuation of their popular series, Auriemma and McGraw understand the need to get along for the good of a sport trying to generate all the attention it can get.
Auriemma and McGraw have also consistently landed a healthy number of the best high school players — for next season, too — and that has created a false narrative reminiscent of what John Calipari faces at Kentucky, that it’s not about the coaching.
“We don’t get all of them; we just get some,” Auriemma said of the talent. “So whatever expectations these kids have, they still have to come and prove it. They just don’t show up in September, go to practice, and somebody says here’s when the championship game is and here’s when the parade is.”
Not many people believed Notre Dame’s young team could halt Connecticut’s title march, but McGraw had promised to challenge Stewart with new looks on defense, and did so. Stewart was largely contained, with Irish defenders taking turns bumping, face-guarding and providing weak-side help on passes into the post.
