Two crew members hurt at Indianapolis 500 in pit road mishap
INDIANAPOLIS -- James Davison was leaving his stall midway through Sunday's Indianapolis 500 when he clipped Pippa Mann, who was coming down pit road.
Davison's car spun into the stall of Tristan Vautier, hitting two of his crew members, Greg Senerius, the right front-tire changer, and Daniel Jang, his right rear-tire changer.
An ambulance came onto pit road and Jang was loaded into the back. He was transported to IU Methodist Health and is undergoing surgery for a broken ankle.
Senerius was treated for a foot injury at the infield care center.
"Unfortunately I got sent out there at the same time Pippa was coming and we made contact and it sent us into our second team car,'' Davison said. "Just a very unfortunate situation."
