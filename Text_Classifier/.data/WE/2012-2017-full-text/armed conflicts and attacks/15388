Belgium raises threat level for Brussels to highest possible level
The ministry’s crisis center declined to provide specific details about the threat, but said a government statement would be released on Saturday morning. “The analysis shows a severe and imminent threat, which requires specific security measures,” the center said in a news release. As part of the measures, the Belgian government is advising people in the Brussels area to avoid crowded places, which includes concerts, train stations, airports, public transportation, and busy shopping streets. It also asked the population to respect security checks and urged against the spread of rumors. Although the statement disclosed no specific details about the threat, the statement’s title referred to the aftermath of the attacks in Paris. “To avoid endangering judicial investigations, further information can not be provided,” it said. The measures apply to the entire Brussels region, which comprises 19 municipalities, including the capital city. All other regions of Belgium remain at level 3, the second-highest level. Last week's terror attacks in the heart of Paris were the deadliest attacks in France since the end of World War II, killing 130 people, and the deadliest in the European Union since bombs killed 191 people on trains in Madrid.
