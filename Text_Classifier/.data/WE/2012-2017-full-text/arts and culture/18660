Olivia de Havilland at 100
Most actresses were dying to play Scarlett in the film of Margaret Mitchell's best-seller, "Gone With the Wind," but de Havilland, center, had her eyes on Melanie. The actress pushed for Warner Bros. to loan her out to producer David O. Selznick for his 1939 epic. She received the first of five Oscar nominations, losing to co-star Hattie McDaniel, left, as best supporting actress, while Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett, took home the best actress award. De Havilland recently told Vanity Fair that McDaniel, the first African-American to win an Oscar, "was the best" and "it was wonderful that she should win."
