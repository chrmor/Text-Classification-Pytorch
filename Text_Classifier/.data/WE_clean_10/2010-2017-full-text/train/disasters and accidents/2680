A giant sinkhole has opened up in Brooklyn
The police have blocked off the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 64th Street in Brooklyn's Sunset Park as a massive sinkhole opened up around 7:30 am Tuesday morning, taking most of the street corner with it.
MyFoxNY reports that there are no reported injuries from the collapse.
National Grid workers are on the scene to work on affected gas lines, and the north bound N train is expecting delays due to the wreckage, CBSNewYork reports. The footage of the sinkhole shows at least one disconnected pipe, and the water lines to several nearby businesses have reportedly been cut off.

It isn't yet clear what caused the sinkhole or whether there was any negligence in maintaining the road that led to the collapse.
