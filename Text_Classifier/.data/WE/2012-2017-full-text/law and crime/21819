Cleveland murder suspect Steve Stephens kills himself after police chase
Erie, Pennsylvania (CNN)Steve Stephens, the Cleveland killer who posted video of the slaying on Facebook, killed himself in Pennsylvania after a police chase, officers said Tuesday.
An employee spotted Stephens' white Ford Fusion in the drive-thru of a McDonald's near Erie and called authorities.
Stephens fled and Pennsylvania State Police troopers gave chase. One officer performed a "PIT" maneuver, a strategic way of ramming a car to disable it.
"As the vehicle was spinning out of control from the PIT maneuver, Stephens pulled a pistol and shot himself in the head," police said.
Steve Stephens was spotted this morning by PSP members in Erie County. After a brief pursuit, Stephens shot and killed himself.
For two days, authorities across the country scrambled to find Stephens, the man wanted for the death of Robert Godwin, a self-taught mechanic and grandfather of 14.
"We're grateful that this has ended," Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said. "We would prefer that it had not ended this way because there are a lot of questions, I'm sure, that not only the family, but the city in general would have had for Steve."
The employee said " 'I think that's the guy. Can you double check I'm right?' " DuCharme said. "When I saw him, I knew it was him. It fits the profile. He didn't look that different than the picture but his beard was trimmed down."
"The hashtags Joy Lane, Joy Lane massacre -- I don't even know who Joy Lane is anymore, or how to pick up all the pieces of my world at this moment," Lane said, the station reported. "I've got a lot of negative comments. Some even said he should have killed me."
