Akhilï¿½s woes: A four-hour wait, a broken bed
Even as the organising committee tried to paint a comfortable picture of the Commonwealth Games Village, the Indian boxing contingent checked into the residential block, only to be greeted by unclean rooms. Then 2006 Games gold medallist Akhil Kumar's bed collapsed.
The 10-member Indian squad was also kept waiting at Olympic Bhawan for nearly four hours before being provided with a bus to the Games' Village.
"The bed did not have plywood under it and the mattresses was placed on the bed. A person cannot differentiate whether there is plywood under the bed or not and the moment I sat on it, it collapsed. We got it changed but if these are the conditions, I guess most of the athletes should be prepared for injuries also," Akhil said.
The boxing team arrived in Delhi in the afternoon. Akhil said the boxers were too tired to scrutinise every aspect of their accomodation before relaxing.
"We reached Olympic Bhavan late in the afternoon to collect our accreditation cards. It was very disappointing that our accomodation was not up to the mark after we completed a long and tiring journey. The athletes are at least entitled a decent place to rest. Even the toilets are not very clean. I have told coach GS Sandhu about this," Akhil said.
Other boxers also complained of unhygienic conditions at the Games Village. "We went to Akhil's room and saw the faulty bed. At least they should have taken care of that. The washrooms are a little dirty and we had to call the support staff to get it cleaned," said 2010 Commonwealth championship winner Amandeep Singh.
The Indian squad includes Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh, Asian champion Suranjoy Singh (52kg) and Commonwealth champions Jai Bhagwan (60kg) and Dinesh Kumar (81kg).
