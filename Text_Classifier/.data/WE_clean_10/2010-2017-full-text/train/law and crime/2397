Nicolas Cage arrested in New Orleans
NEW ORLEANS, April 17 (UPI) -- Actor Nicolas Cage was freed from jail Saturday after an alleged drunken incident on a New Orleans street the night before got him arrested, city police said.
Police said Cage was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public drunkenness, WDSU-TV reported.
The New Orleans TV station said the 47-year-old actor was observed arguing with his wife Alice about 11:30 p.m. Friday. Officers said the couple were standing in front of a residence Cage insisted was their rental home.
Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm and pulled her in the direction he thought they needed to go. He then allegedly started pounding on vehicles and tried to hail a taxi, police said.
A police officer summoned to the scene said Cage appeared to be intoxicated and ordered the actor out of the cab, WDSU-TV said. Cage allegedly started yelling, daring police to arrest him, and the officer complied, TMZ.com reported.
The Hollywood Reporter said A&E reality star Dog "The Bounty Hunter" Chapman posted Cage's $11,000 bond and sprung him from jail about 2 p.m.
Cage, an Oscar-winning actor, has been having financial difficulties, losing a home in the French Quarter to foreclosure auction and selling a Rhode Island Mansion for millions less than he paid for it.
