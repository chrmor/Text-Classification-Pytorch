Canada's Alice Munro, 'master' of short stories, wins Nobel
After the prestigious award was announced, the Nobel committee said on Twitter that it hadn't been able to contact Munro and left a phone message to tell her the good news. But The Canadian Press contacted her, and she was quoted as saying the award was "quite wonderful" and she was "terribly surprised."
"Alice Munro is mostly known as a short story writer and yet she brings as much depth, wisdom and precision to every story as most novelists bring to a lifetime of novels. To read Alice Munro is to learn something every time that you never thought of before," the Man Booker judging panel said at the time.
Munro's most recent short story collection is titled "Dear Life." The New Yorker magazine, in an interview with her last year, said it includes "several narratives in which women in some way shake off the weight of their upbringing and do something unconventional."
She was asked whether it was "normal for girls from rural Ontario to go to university" when she did, noting that in her stories, there "is often a stigma attached to any girl who attracts attention to herself. ... "
"I was brought up to believe that the worst thing you could do was 'call attention to yourself' or 'think you were smart.' My mother was an exception to this rule and was punished by the early onset of Parkinson's disease. (The rule was for country people, like us, not so much for towners.) I tried to lead an acceptable life and a private life and got by most of the time OK," she said.
"For years and years I thought that stories were just practice, till I got time to write a novel. Then I found that they were all I could do, and so I faced that. I suppose that my trying to get so much into stories has been a compensation," she said.
