Twin suicide blasts claimed by ISIS kill 43 in south Beirut suburb
Two suicide bombers blew themselves up on a crowded street in a southern Beirut suburb Thursday, killing at least 43 people and wounding more than 200 in an attack claimed by ISIS and one of the deadliest to strike the country since the outbreak of the Syrian crisis, officials said. The attack during evening rush hour in the suburb of Burj al-Barajneh resembled the series of car bombs and suicide blasts carried out by Syria-based extremists targeting Shiite areas of the country in 2013 and early 2014 in response to Hezbollah's intervention in the Syrian war. The Lebanese Army confirmed that two suicide attackers were behind the attack. "It is not far fetched that ISIS and all of its monstrous affiliates are behind this attack," Khalil told reporters from the site of the blasts. He said that the attack provided reason for Lebanese people to stand by the army and Hezbollah, adding that the fight against terrorism was long from over. In one of the most deadly of those attacks, two suicide bombers targeted the Iranian embassy in the south Beirut area of Bir Hasan in November 2013, killing nearly 30 people.
