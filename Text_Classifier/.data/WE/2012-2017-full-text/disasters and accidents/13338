Unpredictable Alaska wildfire keeps crews guessing as disaster is declared
Cook said the weather was responders' biggest concern. It was predicted to be "hotter, drier and windier" than it was on Sunday, he said, when the fire was able to grow to encompass thousands of acres just hours after it was first reported around 1:15 p.m. on Sockeye Avenue off mile 77 of the highway.
The closure and the heat made for an excruciating wait for some drivers, like Gary Lyon, 53, who was trying to get to a trailer and cabin a few miles north of the roadblock. At 8 p.m., after being parked for five hours, he was sitting shirtless in his station wagon, the fourth car in a line of traffic stretching nearly a mile back on the highway.
