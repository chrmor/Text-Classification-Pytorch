Sex Pistols to Reissue 'God Save the Queen'
The Sex Pistols said they would rerelease “God Save the Queen” in late May for the 35th anniversary of the single’s controversial debut back in 1977, the New Musical Express reported. First released during Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee, the song created a political firestorm. The lyrics and nihilistic vision of Britain’s future offended many people and the BBC refused to play it: “God save the Queen/ She ain’t no human being / There is no future / In England’s dreaming.” (The Sex Pistols, never ones for understatement, also referred to the British government as “a facist regime.”) Still, the song went to No. 2 on the British singles chart.
The rereleased single is expected to be available on May 28. In September the band plans to put out a new expanded edition of their album “Never Mind The Bollocks, Here’s The Sex Pistols,” according to their Web site. In February, Reuters reported that the band had entered into a deal with Universal to put out the anniversary edition of the album, which was their only studio LP.
