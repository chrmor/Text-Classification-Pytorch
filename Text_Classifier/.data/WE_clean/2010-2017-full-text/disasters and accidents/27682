2 Dead, 34 Hurt and Others Still Missing in Rubble
Crews sifting through debris of a powerful explosion and fire that gutted a Maryland apartment building recovered two bodies Thursday and were looking for others still missing, officials said.
The identities of the victims at the Silver Spring complex were still not known, said Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Russ Hamill, and it was unclear exactly how many people were not found amid the chaos.
"As a result of this discovery, this scene and event will be handled as a death investigation," Hamill told reporters.
Police earlier said five to seven peole could not be located following the blast at the Flower Branch Apartments, which was rocked just before midnight Wednesday. Rescue dogs were being used to search the rubble, although parts of the four-story apartment building needed to be secured before investigators could go inside.
The blast was so powerful, according to regional disaster director Paul Carden, that many people were "blown out of their beds."
More than 160 fire and rescue workers were called to the scene to help fight a fire that followed the blast, Montgomery County Fire Chief Scott Goldstein said.
Thirty-one people were transported to the hospital in addition to three firefighters who had non-life-threatening injuries. The firefighters were treated and released.
Kitchens in the building's apartments were reportedly fitted with stoves powered by natural gas.
