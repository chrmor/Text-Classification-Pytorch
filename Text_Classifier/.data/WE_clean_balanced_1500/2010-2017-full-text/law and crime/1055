No guns at GOP convention
The Secret Service is quashing any move to allow guns at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
Some 45,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the convention, revoke its ban on the open carrying of fire arms.
“This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk,” the petition states.
But the Secret Service, which has been protecting presidential candidates on the trail, said on Monday that only law enforcement officers will be allowed to have guns inside the event.
“The Secret Service works closely with our local law enforcement partners in each state to ensure a safe environment for our protectees and the public," the agency said in a statement first reported by The Hill. "Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event.”
The petition was posted last week on change.org by a user going be the moniker “The Hypernationalist.” It’s unclear if it was a legitimate Second Amendment booster or a gun-control advocate seeking to highlight Republican’s avid pro-guns stances in a sarcastic way. But previous tweets indicate that the latter is more likely.
Front-runner  Donald Trump, questioned about the petition on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, said he had not yet read it and so couldn’t say if he supported it.
“I want to see what it says. I want to read the fine print," said Trump, who reiterated that he is a "a very, very strong person for Second Amendment."
