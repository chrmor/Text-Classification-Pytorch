Finnish Opposition Wins Vote
HELSINKI — The opposition Center Party has won Finland’s parliamentary election, but its leader faces tough talks on forming a government after the success of a populist, anti-establishment party that has refused to join such talks in the past.
That party, the Finns Party, won more seats than each of the main partners of the current governing coalition, the conservatives and Social Democrats.
Juha Sipila, the leader of the Center Party, said he would approach the leaders of the three parties on Monday.
“Finding trust between the future government parties is the most important factor,” said Mr. Sipila, whose center-right party traditionally represents farmers and landowners.
