BP Asset Sales at $11 Billion, May Do $19 Billion More
BP Plc’s asset sales to raise cash to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill rose to more than $11 billion, and the disposal of other fields slated for sale may net the company about $19 billion more.
BP said in July it would raise between $25 billion and $30 billion over 18 months from selling oil and gas production assets outside key regions for growth. Today, it announced the sale of $1.8 billion of fields in Vietnam and Venezuela to its Russian joint venture TNK-BP.
TNK-BP Deputy Chief Executive Officer Maxim Barsky said Oct. 6 that the company will get the first look at BP’s assets in Algeria, which may be worth about $3 billion. BP has considered divesting stakes in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay and its 60 percent stake in Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina’s second-largest oil producer, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Robert Dudley took over as chief executive officer on Oct. 1 from Tony Hayward after the company took responsibility for the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP set aside $32.2 billion in the second quarter for the spill, and Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has said the value of the company’s asset base is at least $250 billion.
BP is said to have considered selling part of its interest in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, which produced on average 250,000 barrels a day in August. Earlier this year, China National Offshore Oil Corp. paid partner Bridas Corp. $3.1 billion for a 20 percent stake in Pan American, which has an output of about 100,000 barrels a day.
