Army to probe sexual assault charges in Colombia
WASHINGTON â€” Army criminal investigators plan to probe allegations with officials in Colombia that American soldiers and contractors sexually assaulted civilians there, an Army spokesman said on Friday.
The planned joint investigation will look into "all credible allegations of sexual assault" by U.S. forces in Colombia, said Chris Grey, spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigation Command. Grey noted that a previous allegation regarding the sexual assault of an underage girl by a soldier and a contractor turned out to be unfounded.
American troops and contractors have supported the Colombian government for years in its fight against Marxist insurgents. A U.S.-backed offensive, begun in 2002 by Colombia, has decimated the largest insurgent group, known as FARC.
The new allegations involve more than 50 girls who were allegedly assaulted by soldiers and contractors, with some of the attacks being taped, according to published reports. There has been no record that these attacks have been reported, Grey said.
"Special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are currentlycoordinating with Colombian authorities and will initiate an investigation into any credible allegations of sexual assault or criminal acts committed by U.S. soldiers while in that country," Grey said. "We take this issue very seriously and will aggressively pursue all credible allegations."
In the case of the soldier and contractor, Army investigators sought to interview the alleged victim, Grey said. But her attorneys declined to participate, he said.
