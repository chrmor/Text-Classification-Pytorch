The two Green Party ministers, John Gormley and Eamon Ryan, resign: Taoiseach Brian Cowen assigns their responsibilities to existing Fianna Fáil cabinet members, Éamon Ó Cuív and Pat Carey, giving each of them an unprecedented third portfolio due to a lack of ministers. There are now only seven ministers left in the cabinet, the absolute minimum allowed under the constitution. (The Irish Times) (Irish Examiner)
