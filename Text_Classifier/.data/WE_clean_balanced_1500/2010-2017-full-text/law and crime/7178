ADF no school for scandal
THE broadcasting of a young cadet having sex at the Australian Defence Force Academy was an ''abhorrent'' but ''isolated'' incident, says the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston.
The cadet was covertly filmed and the footage broadcast via Skype to fellow students.
Defending the military against claims that it was still in the Dark Ages about gender issues, the defence chief said he was ''passionate'' about attracting more women into Defence and implied that broader social problems underlay the young air force cadet's ordeal.
''Fundamentally, the incident involved 18-year-olds who had been in the Defence Force for around 10 weeks, and that's something that's been a little bit lost in some of the media commentary,'' he told the Herald.
''If you draw comparisons against similar institutions - I am talking about university campuses - I think the number of incidents of this kind is less at ADFA than at any other campus in the country.
''My own kids went off to uni and I got a feel for what happens at universities. I don't get that same sense of that sort of thing happening at ADFA.
