Typhoon spares Manila, but kills 12 in other parts of country
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from a typhoon that hit the Philippines is now 12.
The capital, Manila, was spared a direct hit today, but the fierce storm still brought down trees and utility poles and tore off roofs.
Officials say most of those killed were pinned by falling trees and electrical posts. A fire volunteer died when he was hit by a block of concrete while hauling down a Philippine flag.
None of the deaths were in Manila.
The typhoon weakened later in the day before it blew out of the country, heading possibly toward northern Vietnam or China’s Hainan Island.
Forecasters say it could regain strength while crossing the South China Sea.
