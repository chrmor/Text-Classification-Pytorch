President "attacked" as unrest rocks Ecuador
There is chaos and confusion in Ecuador with all the signs that a coup d’etat could be taking place.
Struggling to find refuge from angry demonstrators in the capital Quito, President Rafael Correa said he had been attacked and needed medical treatment.
He called for calm from the balcony of a security forces building as police protested below over plans to cut their benefits.
“If you want to kill the president, here I am. Kill me,” Correa told the crowd. “But we will continue with a policy of justice and dignity and we will not take one step backwards.”
Correa has confirmed he is considering the dissolution of parliament.
Congress has been occupied by police, soldiers are occupying the main airport demanding respect over benefits and looting is reported.
Spain has condemned what it calls an “attempted coup d’etat.”
