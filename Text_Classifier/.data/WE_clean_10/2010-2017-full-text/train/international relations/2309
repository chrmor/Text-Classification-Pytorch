Egypt's Navy Seizes Ship Carring Arms in Red Sea
Egypt’s navy seized a Togolese-flagged ship carrying heavy weapons late yesterday and was questioning crew members at the port of Safaga, Reuters reported.
The ship, seized as it entered Egyptian territorial waters in the Red Sea, contained weapons and ammunition, Reuters reported, citing Ahmed Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian military spokesman.
The vessel belongs to a private company that provides security to ships passing through dangerous areas and the weapons discovered “are linked to the nature of their work and the tasks assigned to them to secure commercial vessels,” Ali said, according to the report.
The ship was found north of Ras Muhammad in the Sinai Peninsula, Reuters cited Ali as saying. It was en route to Togo from the Israeli port of Eilat, Agence France-Presse reported, citing unidentified security officials.
