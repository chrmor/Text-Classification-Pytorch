MoD: Azerbaijani side spreads disinformation
"Remaining faithful to the adopted style and roughly violating the ceasefire regime established on the contact line, Azerbaijani side once again has turned to a provocative subversion," such statement issued Information and Public Relations Department of the Ministry of Defense. According to information issued by the press service of the NKR Defense Army, on August 31, at 6:30 pm, in the northeastern part of the contact zone of Karabakh and Azerbaijani forces, an attempt of diversion operation has been undertaken by the enemy in the direction of one of the Armenian positions located in Upper Chaylu village. Due to the vigilance of the Armenian patrol and as a result of the undertaken measures the progress of the enemy has been ceased, and the special detachments of the foe have been forced back to their starting positions, bearing losses, casualties and injuries. “Unfortunately, during the melee Armenian soldier of NKR Defense Army, Rudic Manaseryan born in 1991 was wounded. Details of the incident are under investigation,” the Defense Ministry statement reads. The Azerbaijani side, as usual, has attributed the provocation initiated by itself to Karabakh forces and has disseminated information, as if, as a result of an armed conflict the Armenian side has suffered losses. These statements are absolute misinformation and do not correspond to the reality. “All of this once again comes to prove that the authorities of the neighboring republic ignore the efforts of the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, are unwilling to resolve the conflict peacefully, from time to time resort to provocative acts, artificially destabilize the situation on the border and endanger the negotiation process of the conflict settlement. Such kind of subversions of the Azerbaijani armed forces and their provocative actions not only exacerbated the situation in the Armenian-Azerbaijan line of contact, but also do not correspond to the statements of the neighboring country declaring of their willingness to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in a peaceful way", - the statement reads.
