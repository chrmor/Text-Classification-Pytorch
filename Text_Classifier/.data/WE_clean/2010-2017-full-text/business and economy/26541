Today is 95th Birthday of Late Civil Rights Activist Yuri Kochiyama
And today would have been the 95th birthday of civil rights activist Yuri Kochiyama. Until her death in 2014, Kochiyama championed civil rights, protested racial inequality and fought for causes of social justice. Her activism began after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when she and her family were held in a Japanese-American internment camp. She was with Malcolm X the day he was gunned down in Harlemâ€™s Audubon Ballroom, cradling his head as he lay dying on the stage. Today, Google marked her birthday with an illustration of the civil rights activist on its homepage.
