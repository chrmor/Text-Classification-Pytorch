Giant of GAA Páidí Ó Sé dead aged just 57
In some shocking and desperately sad news Kerry great Páidí Ó Sé has died today, aged just 57.
Some very sad news is emerging from Kerry as Irish Examiner sports editor Tony Leen has tweeted that Kerry legend Páidí Ó Sé has died today.
The 57-year-old won eight All-Irelands as a player and then managed the Kingdom to two more in 1997 and 2000. The Ventry native has been a huge name in the Ireland since the mid-1970s and he was as well known for his wit and wisdom as he was for his superb playing and managerial skills.
Outside of his native county he piloted Westmeath to a first ever provincial crown in 2004 while he also had a stint in charge of the Clare footballers.
During his career as a player he was a majestic and athletic defender and that Ó Sé ability continues into the modern era as his nephews Darragh, Tomás and Marc all followed in his footsteps.
A regular voice and face on TV and radio, he also wrote a column for the Sunday Independent and while you might not always have agreed with him, he was always worth a read. His death leaves a huge hole in Kerry GAA and in the entire world of Gaelic Games.
