poll panel delaying results deliberately
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) â€” The party of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday accused the government election panel of intentionally delaying results that appear to show it winning a massive majority, saying it wants to "maybe play a trick."
The surprising accusation by the National League for Democracy adds an uncertain twist to what has so far been an amicable election, where the ruling party appeared to be taking its expected loss gracefully.
"The Union Election Commission has been delaying intentionally because maybe they want to play a trick or something," NLD spokesman Win Htien told reporters at Suu Kyi's house after a party meeting. "It doesn't make sense that they are releasing the result little piece by piece. It shouldn't be like that," he said.
The election commission has released results for only about 50 seats in the 664-member Parliament whereas the NLD has claimed victory in 154 of the 164 seats in four states. There are 14 states in Myanmar. In addition, the commission announced that the NLD had won 11 of 15 seats in four other regional parliaments.
The accusation raises concern about the intentions of the ruling party, which is beholden to the military that had ruled the country with an iron-grip for about a half century until 2011. Since then, the country has been governed by the Union Solidarity Development Party, made up former junta members.
