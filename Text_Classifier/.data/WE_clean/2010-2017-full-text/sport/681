Indian govt steps in to rescue Games
India's prime minister has pledged "severe" punishment for anyone guilty in corruption scandals engulfing the New Delhi Commonwealth Games.
The government has stepped in to rescue the troubled October 3-14 event in the Indian capital, creating an 'empowered committee' to oversee the Games.
Two members of the Games' organising committee members were sacked last week amid graft controversies.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ordered an investigation of all procedural and other irregularities surrounding the Games.
"Those found guilty should face severe and exemplary punishment," he said in comments reported by Indian media on Sunday.
The prime minister convened a top level emergency meeting on Saturday about the Games, beset by corruption claims and fears facilities won't be finished in time.
