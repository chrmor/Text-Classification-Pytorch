Protesters clashed with police outside the headquarters of the People's Democratic Party (HDP) in the Kurds' main city of Diyarbakır in southeastern Turkey as it became evident President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the AKP were getting a solid majority and would return to power. The tumult spread to other major cities and towns in the Kurdish heartland. The HDP won 10.7 percent of the vote; the party holds 59 of its 80 seats in the parliament. (Al-Ahram) (Wall Street Journal)
