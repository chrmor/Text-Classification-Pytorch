Brazil's Defense Minister Is Ousted
SÃO PAULO, Brazil—President Dilma Rousseff, prompting the third departure among senior cabinet members in recent months, moved Thursday to replace the country's long-serving defense minister after comments by the official that were critical of her government and two fellow ministers.
Nelson Jobim, a holdover from the predecessor administration of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resigned Thursday evening after a conversation with Ms. Rousseff, said a defense ministry spokesperson.
His resignation came after Mr. Jobim, in leaked comments from a coming magazine interview, called one fellow minister weak and criticized Ms. Rousseff's chief of staff as someone who "doesn't even know Brasília," the capital.
In a nod toward further continuity with the prior administration, however, Ms. Rousseff invited Celso Amorim, an influential former foreign minister to Mr. da Silva, to take over as defense minister. Mr. Amorim, one of the architects of Brazil's ascendant role as a voice for developing nations over the past decade, is expected to assume the post in the coming days.
Thursday's personnel change follows two other high-profile departures since June, when Ms. Rousseff's powerful former chief of staff stepped down amid allegations of influence peddling. Her transportation minister resigned last month after reports of widespread corruption among senior aides. Combined, the instability has emboldened rival political parties and hindered the government's ability to pursue tax reforms and other economic initiatives intended to sustain Brazil's economic boom and curtail creeping inflation.
Mr. Jobim in recent months had increasingly expressed his displeasure with the government of Ms. Rousseff, who soon after taking office Jan. 1 decided to ignore his recommendations and postpone a pending purchase of fighter jets for Brazil's air force. Having already drawn fire earlier in the year for saying he was surrounded by "idiots" in the administration, Mr. Jobim angered government colleagues further when he admitted in a recent television interview that he had voted for Ms. Rousseff's opponent in last year's presidential election.
