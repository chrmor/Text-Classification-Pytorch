Two explosions rock British Council on Afghan independence day
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least two suicide bombers attacked the British Council in the Afghan capital Friday, killing at least three people, including two police officers, officials said.
Five people were also injured in the attack inside the heavy-guarded Kabul neighborhood, a strike that coincides with the 92nd anniversary of Afghan independence from Great Britain.
The first militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai.
The second man then attempted to enter the compound wearing a vest filled with explosives. He also detonated himself, Stanikzai said.
Gunfire could be heard throughout the incident, and military helicopter circled overhead, said Muhammad Zahir, a police spokesman.
The British Council is located in the same complex as the British Embassy in downtown Kabul.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's spokesman said.
The attack occurred not far from the Intercontinental Hotel, the scene of another insurgent attack in June against a high-profile western target.
