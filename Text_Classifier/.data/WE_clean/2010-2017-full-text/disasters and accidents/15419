At least 46 people killed in India building collapse
At least 46 people have died -- including 17 children -- and dozens have been injured after an illegal building still under construction collapsed in western India, police said Friday.
The building, in Thane, about 10 kilometers northeast of central Mumbai, caved in on Thursday evening, said Digambar Jangale, a local police official.
Seventy people have been injured, according to another police official, Vinod Parab.
Rescuers are still searching through the wreckage, Jangale said, and five children are among those pulled alive from the rubble so far Friday.
Manoj Gohad, a senior local official, told CNN sister network IBN that people were illegally occupying the first four floors of the building even though it hadn't been completed or authorized.
Jangale said the eighth floor was still under construction when the building gave way.
The collapse might have been the result of poor construction, he said, but authorities are still investigating what caused it.
Police have registered a case of culpable homicide against the builder of the structure, who is yet to be traced, according to IBN.
