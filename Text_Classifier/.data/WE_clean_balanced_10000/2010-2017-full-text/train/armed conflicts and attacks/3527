Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud Is Reportedly Mastermind
A leading Belgian jihadist who is one of the most active ISIS operators in Syria is the suspected mastermind behind the Paris massacre, according to reports.
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who once boasted about evading Western intelligence, is also said to be linked to the thwarted attacks on a Paris-bound high-speed train and a church near the French capital earlier this year.
"He appears to be the brains behind several planned attacks in Europe," a source told Reuters, adding that the 27-year-old was investigators' best lead as the person likely behind the killing of at least 129 people in Paris on Friday. NBC News could not independently confirm the reports, but a U.S. counterterrorism official confirmed Abaaoud had a leading role in the attacks.
The intelligence community "would not discount reports" that Abaaoud had a leading role in the massacre, but suggestions there were one-on-one communications between him and the attackers are "not that simple," the official said. The official would not provide any specifics.
