Coal miner Peabody Energy files for bankruptcy protection; Australian operations to continue as usual
The world's biggest coal miner, Peabody Energy, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States amid the slump in coal prices but says its Australian operations are not affected and will stay open.
In a statement, Peabody Energy said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to shore up its balance sheet and cut debt amid what it called "an unprecedented industry downturn".
The coal giant said its US mining operations were expected to continue as normal during the bankruptcy process.
Peabody said its Australian mines in Queensland and New South Wales were not part of the US bankruptcy filing and were continuing as usual.
Peabody president and chief executive Glenn Kellow said it was a difficult decision but the right path forward for the company.
"Through today's action, we will seek an in-court solution to Peabody's substantial debt burden amid a historically challenged industry backdrop," Mr Kellow said in the statement
"This process enables us to strengthen liquidity and reduce debt, build upon the significant operational achievements we've made in recent years and lay the foundation for long-term stability and success in the future."
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US allow a company to restructure to keep its business afloat and pay creditors over time.
Peabody Energy's 2015 financial report said the firm owed $US10.1 billion. Its total assets are worth $US10.9 billion and it made a $US2 billion loss for 2015.
Peabody's shares have plunged by 97 per cent over the past year because of its financial troubles and lower coal prices.
Coal prices have plunged since 2011 because of oversupply and lower demand from China.
