North Korea warns of more attacks â€“ This Just In
North Korea will launch additional attacks on South Korea if it continues "reckless military provocation," North Korean state media said Thursday.
The Korean People's Army "will deal without hesitation the second and third strong physical retaliatory blow," if South Korea provokes the country by, for example, firing shells into the north's side of the West Sea.
The statement also addressed the U.S.'s role in the conflict, saying "the U.S. would be well advised to drop its inveterate bad habit of pulling up others, falsifying the truth about the situation."
