Tax, climate protesters rally
Climate action campaigners and anti-carbon tax protesters are gearing up for a showdown in Canberra ahead of what's likely to be a fiery parliamentary session.
The ACTU stole the march on the anti-tax protesters on Wednesday, delivering a petition early in the morning to Climate Change Minister Greg Combet supporting action to reduce emissions.
The greenhouse action groups and unions plan to take on protesters who are angry Prime Minister Julia Gillard broke an election promise not to introduce a carbon tax.
Anti-tax rally organiser Chris Johnson, from the Consumers and Taxpayers Association, said a new election should be called to test the government's mandate for a carbon tax.
"The Australian public have not had a chance to vote or have a say on the issue," Mr Johnson said.
Among the anti-tax protesters are the Young Liberals, DLP, Climate Skeptics, the National Civic Council and the Conservative Action Network.
