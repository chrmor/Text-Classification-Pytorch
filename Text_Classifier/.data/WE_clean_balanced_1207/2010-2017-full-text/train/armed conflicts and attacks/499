Syrian troops amass near Turkish border-witnesses
AMMAN, June 23 (Reuters) - Syrian troops massed on the Turkish border overnight, witnesses said on Thursday, escalating tensions with Ankara as President Bashar al-Assad uses increasing military force to try to crush a popular revolt.
Refugees from the northwestern province of Idlib said armoured vehicles and troops were now as close as 500 metres from the border in the Khirbat al-Joz area.
A Reuters photographer in the Turkish border village of Guvecci saw three uniformed Syrian soldiers with a machinegun positioned on the roof of a house on top of a hill. Syrian armoured personnel carriers were visible on a road running along the top of the hill, and machinegun fire was heard although it was not clear who the troops were firing at.
