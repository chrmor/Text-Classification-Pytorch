Ed Sheeran wins best album at Brit awards 2015
With his second album, X, Sheeran beat competition from George Ezra and Sam Smith to claim the best album gong
Ed Sheeran has won the award for British album at the 2015 Brit awards with his second record, X.
Up against albums by Alt-J, George Ezra, Royal Blood and Sam Smith, the awards held at London’s O2 Arena on 25 February saw the hit album by the 23-year-old triumph.
This win should be particularly sweet for the Suffolk singer-songwriter, who failed to take home a Grammy at this year’s ceremony. X was a success on both sides of the Atlantic following its release in June, but failed to pick up any of his three nominations.
Topping the UK chart in 2014, and a mainstay in the top 5 since its release last summer, the album features the same acoustic R&B stylings as debut album +, and included a cameo from Pharrell Williams.
It features the singles Sing, Thinking Out Loud and Don’t, all three of which were hits: Sing became Sheeran’s first UK No 1 single and his second US Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit, Don’t peaked at No 8 in the UK and Thinking Out Loud was a sleeper hit, entering the No 1 spot after 19 weeks in the charts.
“I feel like, with the first album, there were a lot of people who didn’t get it and didn’t really understand the whole thing, and therefore didn’t like it,” Sheeran told Digital Spy ahead of the release of X. “This time around everyone knows what I’m about, and they’ve kind of accepted the sort of artist I am … some people are going to like [the album] and some people are going to hate it. But no one’s going to have a problem with it doing well, whereas first time around people were confused about that.”
This is the latest Brit scoop for the artist, who took home a Brit award for British breakthrough act and British solo male artist in 2012.
