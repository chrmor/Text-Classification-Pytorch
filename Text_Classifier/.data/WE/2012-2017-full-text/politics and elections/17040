Laos holds National Assembly elections
Voters in Laos, a oneparty communist state, turned out Sunday to cast their ballots for National Assembly and Provincial People's Council representatives.
President Choummaly Sayasone and Vice President and General Secretary of the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LRPR) Bounnhang Vorachith both voted at polling stations in the capital Vientiane, according to witness reports.
There are reportedly around 600 candidates vying for fiveyear terms in today's vote.
All candidates are either members of, or have been approved by, the LPRP, which has ruled the country as a oneparty state since 1975.
In quotes reported by the staterun Lao News Agency, Sayasone described the election atmosphere today as "very exciting."
"I am very happy to have seen people enthusiastically exercising their rights casting their votes for people's representatives so that they can have seats at Assembly and councils. This election is very meaningful to our country," he said.
However, it is unclear how many of the 3.74 million eligible voters actually participated in the election today.
In the runup to the vote, locals spoke of apathy about the country's elections, which they said do not bring change.
"People have little interest in the election because our lives do not change from election to election," said one resident who spoke on condition of anonymity to Radio Free Asia.
In the last National Assembly elections, in 2011, the LPRP won 128 seats, alongside just four approved, nonpartisan candidates.
