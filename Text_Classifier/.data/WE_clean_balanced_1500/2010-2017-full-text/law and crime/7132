6 dead in pair of nightclub shootings on Mexico's Gulf coast
Mexican authorities say a total of six men were killed in shootings at two nightclubs in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.
One of the early Sunday incidents was at a nightclub in the state capital of Xalapa. The state prosecutor's office says gunmen opened fire from the deejay's booth on four men sitting at a table in the La Madame club, killing them. About a dozen people were wounded.
Prosecutors say two more men died in a gunfight with law enforcement officers at a club in the Veracruz city of Orizaba. One of the dead was identified as organized crime figure Luis Alberto Carrera Rodriguez, alias "El Negro," or "Blackie."
