Terry Newton found dead at home, aged 31
Newton achieved sporting notoriety in February when he became the first sportsman in the world to be banned after testing positive for human growth hormone (HGH) in a blood sample taken during the close season.
Newton was handed a two-year ban by the RFL and sacked by his club, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.
Newton, who grew up in one of the roughest housing estates in Wigan, published his autobiography “Coming Clean” in June, in which he revealed that he had paid £150 for one month’s supply of the drug.
However, he never revealed the name of his supplier, said to be another current player.
Newton’s body was found at his home in Wigan on Sunday morning, reportedly hanged, and a post-mortem examination and inquest will be held. Newton leaves two children.
Newton began his career with Leeds in 1996 but is perhaps best remembered for his time with Wigan between 2000 and 2005 and Bradford between 2006 and 2009. He won 15 Great Britain caps, scoring three tries, and played five times for England.
A rough, tough and uncompromising forward, Newton was banned for six months in 2005 for a tackle that broke the jaw of the St Helens scrum-half Sean Long.
But he also had a more sensitive side and was haunted by the death of his younger sister, Leanne, after she became addicted to heroin.
Famously, he also broke down in tears on the pitch at Old Trafford after suffering a fourth successive Super League Grand Final defeat with Wigan in 2003.
