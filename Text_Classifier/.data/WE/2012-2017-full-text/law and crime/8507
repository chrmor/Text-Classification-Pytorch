Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán might have suffered a heart attack
MEXICO.- American and Mexican officials have confirmed that Mexican drug lord, Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, appears to have suffered from a heart attack last November, which forced him to be treated at a private hospital in the state of Jalisco under a fake name.
Newspaper Reforma reports the Drug Enforcement Administration, after listening to UHF radio transmissions, discovered Guzmán was admitted between November 15 and 20 to a hospital. However, Mexican officials have been unable to determine exactly to which medical center. It's almost certain "El Chapo" used a fake identity when checking in to any clinic or emergency room, and searches have lead to cities such as San Javier, Manzanillo, Colima, Zapopan and Guadalajara without any success.
This might no lead official to the Sinaloa Cartel boss, but it could prove rumors of the drug lord having serious health issues, since other recent reports have talked about his weight loss and changes in the crime boss's daily habits, like exercising.
In 2004, security forces managed to confiscate a computer with images of Guzmán that showed a robust figure, and these images have since been used in wanted posters and campaigns, but any potential massive weight loss and drastic changes to his complexion could further complicate the search.
Also, the last time Mexican authorities were close to capturing him was in 2012, in Los Cabos. "El Chapo" was able to get away, but security forces that entered his supposed residence found the place fully stocked with exercise equipment.
Since then, there are only rumors as to where Joaquín Guzmán could be, much less concrete intelligence. He is one of the world's most wanted men, and Mexico offers 30 million pesos (about 2.3 million USD) for his capture, while the United States offers 7 million USD.
