Tsunami warning lifted after powerful magnitude 7.0 earthquake strikes off coast of Vanuatu
A tsunami warning has been lifted after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit off the coast of Vanuatu near Norsup.
The US Geological Survey measured the depth of the quake as 35km.
"Hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within 300 km of the epicentre along the coast of Vanuatu," the National Tsunami Warning Center said.
The tsunami warning has since been lifted.
There was no threat to the Australian mainland, islands or territories.
The quake was originally measured as magnitude 7.3 at a depth of 10km but has since been revised by the US Geological Survey.
Vanuatu is part of the "Ring of Fire", a zone of tectonic activity around the Pacific that is subject to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
A 6.5-magnitude tremor hit the country earlier this month but no tsunami alerts were issued.
