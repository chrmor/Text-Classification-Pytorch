Attack Shows Lasting Threat to U.S. in Iraq
A spokesman for the American military in Baghdad, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, confirmed in a statement that American soldiers had joined the defense of the compound, providing “suppressive fire” while Iraqi Army troops counterattacked.
As has often been the case in attacks, the American military also had helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles providing surveillance, and explosives experts took part in the forensic examination of the attack.
The attack was a reminder — unnecessary to Iraqis — that the shift in the American mission did not portend an end to insurgent violence. It also underscored the ambiguous and still-dangerous position for Americans in their role as advisers to Iraq’s beleaguered security forces, who face almost daily attacks from insurgents.
A civilian official who works in the command, which includes the division’s budget office, witnessed American troops inside briefly shooting at the two insurgents, who had entered the building and begun firing on Iraqi and American soldiers and commanders, and throwing out grenades.
Iraqi commanders ordered the American soldiers to stop and leave the final assault on the building to the Iraqi forces, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of standing orders from the Ministry of Defense not to speak to the news media.
The attack ended when one of the two insurgents inside the building detonated a vest of explosives as Iraqi soldiers closed in.
On Tuesday, President Obama declared an end to American combat in Iraq, even as the country’s security remained precarious and its politics deadlocked six months after an election widely expected to usher in a new period of democratic governance.
It was a measure of public distrust and unease that the civilian official inside the compound said that he thought a coup had started and that the acting government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki had collapsed.
“We were struck inside the building for more than three hours,” said the official, who asked to be identified only by his honorific, Abu Ali. He was among those helping tend to the wounded before the gun battle began. “Everyone blamed the politicians for not forming a government.”
The attack struck the same headquarters where a suicide bomber had penetrated the heavily defended perimeter less than three weeks ago and detonated explosives amid a group of army recruits. The death toll in that attack eventually rose to 57, with dozens more wounded.
American military officials have recorded a significant increase this year compared with last year in casualties during Ramadan, the Islamic holy month that began last month and ends later this week.
The Islamic State of Iraq, a front that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, is believed to be trying to exploit the withdrawal of thousands of American troops over the summer to sow chaos after the election’s inconclusive result.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday’s attack, but the Islamic State of Iraq has claimed to have carried out most attacks like it, including the one on recruits and an offensive that included car bombings, roadside mines and shootings 12 days ago that killed at least 56 people, most of them police officers, in 13 towns and cities across the country.
At Medical City Hospital nearby, where the dead and wounded were taken Sunday, Qusay Abid, 27, searched for his father, a soldier from the base.
“Is he the one with green eyes?” a hospital worker asked, checking a list of 32 names, written in red ink.
His voice softened. “Sorry, but your father was killed.”
“Oh my God,” Mr. Abid shouted, dropping to his knees. “Just let me see him. Just show me his body. Why did he die like this? Why?”
