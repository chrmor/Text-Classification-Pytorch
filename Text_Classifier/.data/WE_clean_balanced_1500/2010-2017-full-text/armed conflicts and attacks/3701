Bomb Kills Three In Quetta, Pakistan
Police in Pakistan say at least three people have been killed and 32 wounded by a bomb that exploded in the volatile southwestern city of Quetta.
Police spokesman Shahzada Farhat said the bomb was rigged to a bicycle that was parked in a shopping area on a road to the city's airport on June 24.
Several shops were also damaged by the explosion.
Police officer Chaudhry Manzoor said there did not appear to be a target. He said the blast apparently was aimed at triggering "panic and terror."
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
But Quetta is close to the Spin Boldak crossing into southern Afghanistan's Kandahar Province and has long been a stronghold for the Afghan Taliban.
