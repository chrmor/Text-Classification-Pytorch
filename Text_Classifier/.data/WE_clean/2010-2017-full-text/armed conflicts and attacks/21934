Seven dead, dozen injured as attacks rock Thai south
Three people were killed and a dozen injured in four separate bomb blasts in Thailand's war-torn deep south, police said Saturday, while another four died from shooting and arson attacks. More than 6,300 people have been killed in near-daily conflict pitting troops and police against rebels seeking greater autonomy for the three Muslim-majority provinces bordering Malaysia since 2004 . In the latest spate of attacks, three people died Friday evening when a motorcycle bomb exploded outside a karaoke bar in southern Songkhla province's Sadao district, which borders the conflict-hit region and is frequently swept up in the unrest.
