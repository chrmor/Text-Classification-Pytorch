New York Today: Mercury on the Move
During today’s transit, Mercury will look like a moving freckle on the sun.
But don’t stare straight at it with sunglasses or binoculars: You’ll need the help of a solar telescope, which Professor Kendall and other astronomers have set up across the city.
Where to watch: Carl Schurz Park, Inwood Hill Park, High Bridge, Central Park, Fort Greene Park, Museum of Natural History and the High Line.
Here’s what else is happening:
Mother Nature is on the fence.
She’s given us back our blue skies, with temperatures to match: Today’s high is 73.
But curb the urge to throw on a sundress or shorts. Strong winds should whip through the city and could create gusts of up to 30 miles per hour this afternoon.

If you’re too crunched for time to get behind a solar telescope today, there are other goings-on coming to a sky near you.
These coming events will be visible from New York.
Simply look up and admire.
May 21 brings us a seasonal blue moon next to Mars, Professor Kendall said.
And Mars will be at opposition on May 22, meaning it will be directly across from the sun, and at its biggest and brightest, he added.
The Perseid meteor shower will take place in August, and late that month you’ll also see a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, a beautiful view of the two planets strikingly close together.
There’s always the super moon in November.
And if you spot any U.F.O.s or aliens throughout, let us know.
