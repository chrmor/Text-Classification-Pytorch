Reporter for Government Radio Is Killed in Somalia
MOGADISHU, Somalia — A Somali journalist was shot to death on Sunday outside his home in Mogadishu by unknown gunmen, becoming the fourth journalist killed in his country this year, officials said.
The journalist, Mohamed Ibrahim Rageh, was a reporter for the state-run Radio Mogadishu and Somali National Television. He fled Mogadishu in September 2009 after a spate of killings, and was among a few journalists who had returned to continue their careers.
Mr. Rageh left work around 5 p.m. Sunday for his home in the Dharkenley district, said Abdirahim Isse Addow, director of Radio Mogadishu. “But, after a while, we heard very disheartening news about his death,” Mr. Addow said, adding that Radio Mogadishu’s work would continue as usual.
After leaving Somalia in 2009, Mr. Rageh worked as Somali National Television’s correspondent in Kampala, Uganda. He is survived by his wife and two children.
No group claimed responsibility for the killing.
Somalia is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist. On Jan. 18, gunmen shot to death Abdi Hareed Osman of Radio Shabelle, and two other journalists were killed this year in suicide bombings. In 2012, 18 journalists and media workers were killed in Somalia.
