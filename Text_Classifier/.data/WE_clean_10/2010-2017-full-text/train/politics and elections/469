Violence flares in Guinea amid poll result
Deadly violence flared in Guinea hours ahead of results of its first democratic presidential election since independence from France over 50 years ago, as both candidates claimed victory.
Veteran opposition leader Alpha Conde, 72, said he had "clearly" won the run-off, while former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo said results "purged" of fraud showed him to be the winner.
At least one person was killed and dozens injured as security forces clashed with Diallo's supporters in the streets of Conakry, with soldiers firing on protesters who lobbed stones and other objects at them, police and witnesses said.
Election results would be announced from 1800 GMT on Monday evening, the electoral organising commission said in a statement issued more than a week after the run-off election was held.
The two candidates were neck and neck according to partial results in the crucial vote which aims to end 52 years of dictatorship and military rule in the west African country.
Conde called a press conference earlier on Monday claiming victory and urging that the announcement of results go ahead.
