Three dead in Manila apartment blast
Three people have been killed in a mysterious explosion in a luxury apartment building in the Philippine capital, a government minister says, as officials lowered the death toll from the blast.
Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said authorities were still trying to assess what had triggered the blast but initial investigations found no evidence of a bomb.
"We still have not seen any triggering device of any kind among the debris," Roxas told reporters hours after the explosion in a fifth floor unit in the high-end condominium, while bomb-sniffing dogs had found no sign of explosives.
"We are not ruling out anything," he told reporters just before touring the shattered apartment.
The explosion late on Friday knocked out the wall of the condominium unit, sending a huge chunk of rubble hurtling to the street where it crushed a delivery van, killing the three men inside.
The government's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council had earlier said three other men had been found dead in the room where the blast occurred, but later withdrew the statement saying it was inaccurate.
