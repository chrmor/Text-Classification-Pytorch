Norfolk Islanders occupy grounds of former parliament
Protesters on Norfolk Island are occupying the grounds of the former legislative assembly and refusing to leave.
They are angry that the Australian federal government will assume full control of the territory in July.
Canberra recently ended the island's limited autonomy and will make it a ward of New South Wales.
There have been reports of death threats, sabotage and victimisation of locals perceived to be doing the bidding of mainland authorities.
Norfolk Islanders say the failure to have an amicable dialogue with Australia has prompted them to present a petition to the UN accusing Canberra of violating their right to self-determination.
The petition was delivered on Monday in New York as a last resort after Australia ended the island's limited self-government.
A former Norfolk Island Chief Minister Andre Nobbs told RNZ International this is despite 68 percent of the islands residents voting against the changes.
