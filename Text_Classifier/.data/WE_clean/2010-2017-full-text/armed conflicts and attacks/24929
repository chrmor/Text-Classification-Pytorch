Kurdish forces reportedly capture Mennagh Military Airport in northern Aleppo
According to several Kurdish social media activists, the People’s Protection Units Units (YPG) – backed by Jaysh Al-Thuwwar of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – have seized the strategic Mennagh Military Airport in northern Aleppo after a violent battle with the Islamist rebels of Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham (largest Islamist/rebel group), the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and Jabhat Al-Shamiyah (Levantine Front).
While no photos have been released from the Mennagh Military Airport tonight; it is most likely under the control of the YPG and SDF after several Islamist social media activists confirmed the complete withdrawal of their forces from the primary base and its nearby village.
If the news is true about the SDF and YPG capturing the Mennagh Military Airport; this could ultimately spell trouble for the Islamist rebels in northern Aleppo, as they will be forced to retreat towards their primary stronghold of ‘Azaz near the Turkish border-crossing into the province.
More importantly, should the YPG and SDF choose to attack ‘Azaz in the future, they will be able to launch the assault from two different flanks in northern Aleppo, leaving the Islamist rebels at their mercy.
The Russian Air Force led the airstrikes over the Mennagh Military Airport on Tuesday, as the U.S. sat out this offensive in order to avoid escalating the political turmoil with the Turkish regime.
