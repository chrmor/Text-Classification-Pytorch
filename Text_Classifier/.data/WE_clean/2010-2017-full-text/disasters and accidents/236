Transcript details last moments of Polish plane
WARSAW - Pilots of the doomed aircraft carrying Poland's President Lech Kaczynski received at least a dozen warnings from on-board systems to regain altitude during the last minute before the crash, according to transcripts from its cockpit recorders released by the government on Tuesday.
"Pull up, pull up... Terrain ahead," the on-board warning system told the pilots shortly before the crash on April 10.
The transcripts recorded how one of the pilots cursed after the plane hit a tree. The last sound recorded was a prolonged curse by an unidentified person in the cockpit.
