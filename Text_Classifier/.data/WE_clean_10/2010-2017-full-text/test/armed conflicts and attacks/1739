Suicide Bombers Strike Northeastern Nigeria
ABUJA, Nigeria—An elderly woman and a 10-year-old girl blew themselves up at a Muslim prayer gathering in northeastern Nigeria on Friday, in what appeared to be a deadly Boko Haram attack staged days before the Nigerian president’s visits the U.S.
The girl, wearing a flowing white robe, walked into a crowded public square in the city of Damaturu, said Aba Abdullahi, a member of self-defense militia tasked with protecting the area. Muslims had gathered there to mark the end of Ramadan, a holy month of fasting.
