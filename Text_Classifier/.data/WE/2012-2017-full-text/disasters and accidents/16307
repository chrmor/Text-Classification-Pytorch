Seven killed in train-truck crash near Cairo
At least seven people were killed and three injured as a truck collided with a train near Egypt's capital Cairo on Sunday, the media reported.
The accident took place when the truck stormed a locked railway barrier in Ayat district, Xinhua reported.
The train did not stop after the accident, the report said.
In Egypt, experts blame lack of maintenance and the poor condition of the railway network for frequent accidents.
In November 2014, at least 27 people were killed and 32 injured when a freight train crashed into a mini-bus and a truck near Cairo.
