23 Oil Workers Kidnapped in Colombia
Authorities in Colombia say 23 oil workers have been kidnapped in the eastern part of the country. Reports say the workers were employees of a subcontractor for Canada's Talisman Energy. A company spokesman tells Colombia's RCN radio most of the workers were local hires. Colombian authorities say FARC rebels could have been responsible for the kidnapping. The FARC is Colombia's largest rebel group and has been fighting the government since the 1960s. Colombia, the United States and the European Union have designated the FARC as a terrorist organization.
