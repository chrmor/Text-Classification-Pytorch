Relative of Kiryat Arba killer tries to stab cop in Hebron, is shot dead
Security forces on Friday morning thwarted an attempted attack next to the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West Bank city of Hebron. According to Palestinian sources, the attack was carried out by a relative of the teenage terrorist who on Thursday murdered 13-year-old Hallel Yaffa Ariel as she slept in her own bed.
Palestinian sources named Friday’s assailant as Saara Hagog, 27, a member of the Tarayrah family from the village of Bani Naim, adjacent to Kiryat Arba. Ariel was killed by 17-year-old Muhammad Nasser Tarayrah, also from Bani Naim.
Police said that the woman approached Border Police officers at the entrance to the Tomb armed with a knife, and tried to stab one of them. No Israelis were hurt in the incident.

The officers shot the woman, police said. She was treated for her wounds by the security forces, but was later pronounced dead.
“A female terrorist armed with a knife approached a Border Police post at one of the entrances to the Tomb of the Patriarchs and suddenly drew a knife and tried to stab one of the policemen,” a police statement said.
“He responded and shot the terrorist.”
According to initial accounts of Thursday morning’s brutal stabbing attack, Muhammad Nasser Tarayrah jumped the fence at Kiryat Arba — a breach that sent an alert to the Israel Defense Forces and civilian security guards in the area — and broke into the Hallel Ariel’s bedroom, where she was sleeping.
Forces searching for the cause of the breach heard screams coming from the house and raced in to find the girl with multiple stab wounds in her bed. One of the guards hurried to her to provide first aid and was jumped by the attacker who managed to stab him.
The girl’s father and other guards fired shots at the attacker, killing him, and also wounding the responding guard.
