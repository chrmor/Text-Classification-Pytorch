IDF: Warning Shots Deliberately Missed Syrian Post
Military sources told Agence France Presse, Sunday, that the army fired a single Tammuz anti-tank missile toward a Syrian outpost as a warning shot in response to the latest Syrian mortar shell to land on the Golan Heights. The sources said, "We shot toward them but deliberately missed."
The mortar fire is believed to be connected to the Syrian civil war. Last week, Israel said rebel forces had responded to Israeli warnings about being careful with their fire against government troops. The military issued a statement that "Fire emanating from Syria into Israel will not be tolerated and shall be responded to with severity."
