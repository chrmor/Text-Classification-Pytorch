Tunisia: Ex-President Is Convicted
Tunisiaâ€™s former president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, was convicted in absentia on Monday of smuggling drugs, guns and archaeological artifacts; sentenced to more than 15 years in prison; and fined $72,000. In June, he and his wife were sentenced to 35 years in prison and fined $64 million for embezzlement and other charges. Authorities say 91 more charges remain just for the civil courts. Mr. Ben Ali ruled Tunisia for more than two decades. He fled in January to Saudi Arabia, which refuses to extradite him.
