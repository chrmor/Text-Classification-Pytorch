London's Victoria station evacuated after train fire
Blaze on Gatwick Express train causes severe delays with travellers forced to use other stations
Victoria station in London was evacuated as a fire on a Gatwick Express train caused severe delays and disruption for commuters in the capital on Thursday morning.
Thousands of travellers had to alight at stations short of the busy transport hub, with operators Southern warning of cancellations and delays of up to 45 minutes.
Other train companies accepted Southern tickets in and out of London stations. Tube trains continued to run normally and were accepting rail tickets "for any reasonable route".
The station reopened within a short time but knock-on problems were expected for some time.
Tom Edwards, an antiques dealer from London, who was trying to get a train to visit his mother, said he spotted flames and black smoke coming from the train.
"There was just a little bit of flames by the wheels," he said. "They put it out and then started chucking everybody out of the building. There was no panic. It could have got pretty bad if they hadn't done something about it straight away."
On its Twitter feed, Southern said : "No one was hurt, which was good."
