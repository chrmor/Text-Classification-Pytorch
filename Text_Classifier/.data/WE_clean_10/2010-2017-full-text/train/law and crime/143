U.C.L.A. Shooting Was Murder-Suicide, Police Say
LOS ANGELES — Two men were killed in a shooting at the University of California, Los Angeles on Wednesday, prompting thousands of frightened students and staff members to hunker down or run for shelter as the police went door to door searching for the gunman or other victims.
After a lockdown that lasted throughout the morning, the Los Angeles police said that the gunman was among the dead, and declared the campus safe.
“A homicide and a suicide occurred,” Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, said. “It appears it is entirely contained. We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to U.C.L.A.’s campus.”
A gun was found at the scene, and Chief Beck said, “There is evidence there that could be a suicide note.”
