"It's clear the costs of this incident are the gas company's," Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission, said in an interview Wednesday. "The CPUC will be tracking all of the gas company's costs to make sure they are not allocated to ratepayers and that the shareholders have full responsibility."
