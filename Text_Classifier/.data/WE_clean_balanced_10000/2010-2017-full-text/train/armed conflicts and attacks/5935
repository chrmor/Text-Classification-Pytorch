President Arrives in Istanbul After Military Group Tries to Seize Power
Turkeyâ€™s president told the nation Saturday that he is in charge and a coup attempted by elements of the military would fail. Dozens were reportedly killed in gunfire and clashes overnight.
President Tayyip Erdogan blamed a" "minority within the military" in a televised address to the country after landing at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport at around 4 a.m. Saturday local time (9 p.m. Friday ET).
"They are going to pay for this in the harshest way," Erdogan vowed.
Erdogan said he was on vacation in Marmaris when the attempted coup unfolded, and after he left F-16 fighter jets bombed the area where he stayed. He said his general secretary was abducted by those carrying out the coup and there is no information on the chief of the military staff.
It wasn't clear that the coup was over. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said early Saturday that the situation was largely under control, but later said rebel fighters in Ankara and Istanbul were still firing from the air. A large blast was earlier heard inside the parliament building in capital of Ankara and Turkish TV showed damage to the top of the building.
The Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement late Friday ET that "Our president and government are in charge."
