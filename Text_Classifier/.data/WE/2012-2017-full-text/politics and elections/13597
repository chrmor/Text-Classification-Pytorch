South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley Signs Bill Removing Confederate Flag
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Thursday signed into law a measure to remove the contentious Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol, the culmination of a years-long movement that was reignited by the murders of nine members of a historically black church in Charleston.
Before adding her signature to the legislation, Haley spoke of the black victims, who were killed by a white man after they welcomed him into a June 17 prayer meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Church.
Their act of love and faith, Haley said, set into motion a chain of events that led to the flag's removal less than a month later.
"May we never forget the actions that those people took to get us to this point today," the governor said.
Haley noted that when the confessed killer, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, was caught, relatives of the victims said in court that they forgave him. That act of forgiveness, Haley said, sparked a wave of compassion around the country that motivated people to change things.
In the days after the shootings, photos emerged of Roof posing with the Confederate flag, a Civil War relic that is also seen as an emblem of racism. That sparked a nationwide debate about the flag's place in American culture. Many businesses stopped making and selling the flag and its images, and public officials discussed removing the flag from public grounds.
That included South Carolina, which first flew the Confederate flag at Capitol in Columbia in 1962 as a response to the civil rights movement.
The state legislature, which lost state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, Emanuel's top pastor, in the shooting, responded by voting overwhelmingly this week to take the flag down.
