Mike Huckabee Suspends 2016 Presidential Race
Mike Huckabee announced that he is suspending his campaign for the 2016 presidential race Monday night.
Since announcing his run on May 5, 2015, in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Huckabee ran a campaign centered on social conservatism, protecting entitlement programs from cuts and completely revamping the federal tax system.
While he struggled for attention and donations in a crowded Republican field, his controversial comments, at times, attracted attention.
His campaign never took off, though, even as he concentrated intensely on winning over caucus-goers in Iowa as he had before. He visited all 99 counties there and spent much more time trying to garner support in the Hawkeye State than in any other.
