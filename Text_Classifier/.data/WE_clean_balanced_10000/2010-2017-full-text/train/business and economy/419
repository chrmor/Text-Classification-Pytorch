Driver error caused Toyota's 'runaway' cars, US study suggests
A safety scandal over sticking accelerators that forced Toyota into a crisis-stricken recall of millions of vehicles may have been overblown, according to tentative findings from a US government investigation that suggest driver error was the cause of most of the Japanese manufacturer's "runaway" cars.
Early this year, Toyota was convulsed by a quality scare that culminated in its president, Akio Toyoda, delivering a humbling apologyto hostile members of Congress in Washington over supposed defects that caused its cars to speed out of control, contributing to fatal accidents. More than 9.5m vehicles were recalled, damaging Toyota's global reputation.
But an analysis of vehicles' data recorders by engineers from the US department of transport and Nasa has found that in the vast majority of "runaway" cases, drivers failed to press the brake pedal at all or pressed the brake only in the final moments before a crash.
In preliminary findings delivered to Congress on 58 incidents, investigators found that in 35 cases, the brake was not applied. In a further 14 cases there was only "partial braking". In one case, both the brake and accelerator pedals were depressed and another showed evidence of pedals getting trapped in a floor mat. But the investigation found no evidence of any electronic problem suggested by Toyota's critics as a likely cause of crashes.
A US transport department spokeswoman stressed that the findings were only "one small part" of a broader investigation, with research still under way to "determine whether there are potential electronic or software defects in Toyotas that can cause unintended acceleration".
In February, federal safety regulators linked out-of-control acceleration in Toyotas to accidents that had claimed 34 lives over the last decade. The issue hit the headlines following an accident in San Diego, in which a police officer and three of his relatives were killed when their Toyota Lexus weaved down a highway.
Toyota has always insisted that the problem is down to pedals occasionally getting stuck under floor mats, rather than any fundamental electronic or mechanical defect. Responding to questions on Twitter, Toyota USA's chief quality officer, Steve St Angelo, said: "We've identified two causes – floor mat entrapment and sticking pedals. We are confident that it's not the electronics."
At the height of the furore surrounding the scare, Toyota's president was subjected to sustained attacks by American politicians. One Republican congressman, John Mica, told Toyoda that he had let down the Japanese firm's US employees: "I'm embarrassed for you sir. I'm embarrassed for my dealers who I've talked to. I'm embarrassed for thousands of hard-working Americans who work in more than 10 plants across the United States."
But sceptics of the safety scare found backing in the findings. David Champion, director of Consumer Reports' testing division, said complaints about Toyotas could be connected with the carmaker's relatively aged consumer base: "Toyota did have a higher incident rate of complaints about unintended acceleration but that could be down to an older demographic group who drive Toyotas and who may not necessarily be car enthusiasts."
