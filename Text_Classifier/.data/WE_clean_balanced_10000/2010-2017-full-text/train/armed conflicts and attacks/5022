British Aid Worker Kidnapped in Somalia
NAIROBI, Kenyaâ€”Masked gunmen abducted a Briton and a Somali working for aid agency Save the Children from a compound in western Somalia, the agency and a witness said Friday. The Somali was later released.
Local resident Moalim Bashir said he didn't know who had taken the two men on Thursday evening from the town of Adado, near the border with Ethiopia. He said tensions in the town were high as a militia was massing to the south and might attempt to try to take the town from those currently in control.
