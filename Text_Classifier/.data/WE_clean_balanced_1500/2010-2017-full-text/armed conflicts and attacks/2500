Man taken to hospital after embassy stand off
A Palestinian who broke into the Turkish Embassy in Israel in an apparent attempt to seek asylum has been turned over to Israeli authorities.
After a seven-hour stand-off the man, named in reports as Nadim Injaz from the West Bank, was escorted out of the embassy wearing handcuffs.
Wearing a light blue shirt and limping slightly from an apparent gunshot wound, he was put onto a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance.
