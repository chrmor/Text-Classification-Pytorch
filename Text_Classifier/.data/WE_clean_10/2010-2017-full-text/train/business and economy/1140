To further the relationship, Jia proposed the two sides take a long-term and strategic perspective in planning for and growing China-Africa relations, explore new channels for cooperation, build on the successful relationship and ensure continuous dynamics of the forum, and enhance coordination and jointly uphold the interests of developing countries.
Nolana Ta Ama, Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in China and Togo's ambassador to China, said the forum, established against the backdrop of growing divide of North and South, rich and poor, demonstrated people's real aspiration of developing countries.
He applauded the fruitful results of the forum and hoped China would continue its successful policies to boost cooperation of all areas with Africa.
The forum has held four ministerial meetings so far and a summit in November 2006 in Beijing, when Chinese President Hu Jintao announced a package of proposals to provide assistance, increase investment to build a new type of strategic partnership with Africa.
In November 2009, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao attended the fourth ministerial conference of FOCAC in Egypt and announced eight new measures, including debt cancellation.
Trade between China and African nations has increased over the past decade, rising from US$10.6 billion in 2000 to US$106.8 billion in 2008, China's Commerce Minister Chen Deming said.
More than 1,600 Chinese firms have invested in Africa, boosting local economic growth and creating thousands of jobs, according to Chen.
