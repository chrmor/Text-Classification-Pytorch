Six killed in US drone strike in Pakistan
Islamabad, Sep 2 (IANS) At least six people were killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's northwestern tribal region of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
The US unmanned aircraft fired two missiles at a compound in the Shawal valley of North Waziristan that borders Afghanistan, Xinhua reported.
The strike killed six suspected militants inside the compound. They are yet to be identified.
Residents of the area rushed to the site and pulled out the bodies from the debris. Death toll may further rise as some more suspected militants are feared to be buried under the debris.
