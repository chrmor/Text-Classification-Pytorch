Bruce Golding stepping down
JLP Leader Bruce Golding will not seek re-election at the party's annual general conference in November, and will step down as prime minister as soon as a new leader has been elected. According to a statement from Daryl Vaz, minister with responsibility for information, Golding conveyed this decision to the party's central executive at its quarterly meeting, held at the Belmont Road headquarters today. Golding had said he had planned to lead the party into a second term of government and demit office within two years thereafter. "The challenges of the last four years have taken their toll and it was appropriate now to make way for new leadership to continue the programmes of economic recovery and transformation while mobilizing the party for victory in the next general elections," the prime minister said. editorial@gleanerjm.com
