ISIS successfully splits Deir Ezzor enclave in two
ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency has announced that it has successfully split the government-held pockets of Deir Ezzor in two.
The terrorist group are now besieging the military air base that has been separated from the city.
To successfully besiege the military base, ISIS has relentlessly been sending in suicide bombers to weaken the Syrian Army defences.
Over 40 Syrian air strikes was not enough to divert the waves of ISIS attacks.
The cemetery is still under Syrian Army control and if ISIS do not quickly capture it, they remain susceptible to a counterattack and ending the siege.
Meanwhile the Syrian Army continue to repell the ISIS offensive on the southern axis in Panorama and Al-Mohandesin, whilst Syrian air strikes continue to target ISIS positions on Mt. Tharda.
The civilian areas of Al-Qossour and Al-Joura are being targeted by indiscriminate ISIS shelling resulting in the death of oneÂ woman and her daughter being injured.
It has been estimated that as many as 14,000 ISIS fighters are participating in this operation to capture Deir Ezzor from government forces.
Meanwhile, ISIS has promised a house and a wife in Deir Ezzor for every fighter who participates in the battle.
As a government enclave in the middle of ISIS territory, the Syrian Army serves as a thorn in the back and diverts many ISIS fighters from other fronts such as Mosul in Iraq.
