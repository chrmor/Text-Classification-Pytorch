Syrian rebel groups unite to fight ISIS
More than 20 Syrian rebel commanders, including members of Christian opposition groups, have signed off on what they called a historic agreement to unite in the fight against ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
The deal came out of a meeting Thursday in Turkey facilitated by staff from the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force. Two U.S. congressmen sat in on the final negotiations between the groups, just days after Congress signed off on President Barack Obama's call to arm and train moderate rebels to fight ISIS.
Under the agreement, moderate Muslim rebel groups fighting under the Supreme Military Council of Syria agreed to form an alliance with the predominantly Christian Syriac Military Council. It marks the first meetingbetween Syrian rebels and members of Congress since Obama announced the new policy.
The agreement calls for the groups to work together to assure any free Syria will be inclusive of all ethnic, religious and political parties. While the group called it historic, it may at this stage be only a symbolic gesture given that these groups are already fighting alongside each other against al-Assad's forces and ISIS.
Among the groups that met with Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. George Holding, R-North Carolina, was the Supreme Military Council of Syria and the Syriac Military Council, made up of Christians. CNN was the only news agency present at the meeting.
It is unclear when the groups might receive the arms and training they've been promised. It's also unclear if all of the groups present will benefit.
This is not the first time that groups opposed to ISIS have agreed to fight together. Previous efforts faltered, sometimes over ethnic and religious divides.
While the Supreme Military Council of Syria includes the Free Syrian Army, which is considered one of the leading moderate forces, there are questions about other members of the alliance.
The Syrian Revolutionary Front reportedly signed a deal with ISIS in one suburb in Damascus, and another -- the Hazzam group -- put out a statement this week condemning U.S. airstrikes.
"Well, I think the question has been answered," said Khalid Saleh, the spokesman for the National Coalition for Syria.
He said the Free Syrian Army brigades, which have been receiving aid for months, have been vetted, and he called for an increase in the flow of aid and support to them.
The rebel groups told CNN that coalition airstrikes against ISIS targets were not enough. The strikes must also hit al-Assad's forces, they said.
"This is a partial strategy. It's a containment policy that did not work and will not work," Saleh said.
"We need to deal with this problem at its root cause: Assad, the gangs that support him and ISIS. Those are the three problems every Syrian deals with."
