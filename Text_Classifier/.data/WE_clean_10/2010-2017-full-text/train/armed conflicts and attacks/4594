6 killed in twin suicide attacks in Cameroon
At least six people were killed and more than 30 injured on Wednesday in twin suicide attacks in Cameroon along the northern border with Nigeria, security forces said.
Six civilians were killed when two suicide bombers blew themselves up during a funeral ceremony in Nguetchewe village, The Agence France Presse quoted its source as saying. The AFP, quoting its police source, reported that there were children, including a boy aged six and a 15-year-old, among the victims.
"The villagers were gathered for the wake when two suicide attackers joined them, pretending to be family members," the source said. The two female bombers "blew themselves up at 6:20 a.m., just when people who had spent the night there were preparing for a meal."
Cameroon was rocked by several attacks this year. The Jan. 25 suicide bombings in a market in northern Cameroon was termed as the deadliest attacks in the country wherein at least 32 people were killed and 66 others were injured, Reutersreported.
Another attack occurred on Jan. 28 when two suicide bombers killed at least four people at a school in the town of Kerawa in northern Cameroon.
In yet another incident on Jan. 13, as many as 10 people were killed when two female suicide bombers blew themselves up at a mosque in northern Cameroon's Kouyape Kolofata.
Boko Haram Islamic militants in Nigeria have reportedly stepped up attacks in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
