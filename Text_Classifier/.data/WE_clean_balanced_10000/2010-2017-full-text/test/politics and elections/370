Myanmar sets penalty for election boycott
OSLO, Norway, Nov. 1 (UPI) -- Ruling military authorities in Myanmar said opposition forces found guilty of encouraging a boycott of Sunday's general election could face jail time.
Myanmar has general elections scheduled Sunday, the first time for such a vote in more than 20 years.
Opposition groups in the country are calling for a boycott of the polls. Authorities, however, said anyone "inciting the people to boycott" faces a financial penalty, one year in prison, or both, opposition newspaper Democratic Voice of Burma reports.
Myanmar authorities said the general election is a positive step toward civilian leadership, though international observers have raised doubts about the claims.
There are 37 parties slated to take part in the Sunday election, though the military junta is slated to win as it is fielding more than 1,000 candidates. Opposition groups are fielding about 10 percent of that number.
The United Nations said Myanmar could ease international concerns by releasing opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Authorities said she could be freed by Nov. 13, though the opposition newspaper said authorities may find more reasons to extend her detention.
