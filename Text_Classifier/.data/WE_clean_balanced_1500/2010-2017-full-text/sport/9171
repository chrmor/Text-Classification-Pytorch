Nadal, Still Recovering From Knee Problems, Will Miss United States Open
But Nadal later repeatedly deemed himself “not ready” or “not in condition” to return, acknowledging the knee as a problem. His camp, meanwhile, provided mixed messages about the severity of his injury.
Updates were posted to Nadal’s Facebook page in the past week saying he had been practicing on the court and had done “some specific work to recover my knee at the gym,” but on Wednesday morning an update said he was “still not ready.”
“I have to continue with my recuperation and preparation to be ready to play in the right conditions,” the update said.
In an interview on Catalan radio, Nadal’s coach and uncle, Toni Nadal, said that his nephew’s season was not over and that he could possibly return for Davis Cup play. Spain will host the United States in the semifinals the weekend after the United States Open. If the Spanish win, they will play in the final in mid-November.
Nadal’s ranking is unlikely to drop far because of his absence from the Open. Andy Murray will have the opportunity to move ahead of Nadal into No. 3, but the gap between the ATP’s so-called Big Four — Roger Federer, Djokovic, Nadal and Murray — and the rest of the tour makes Nadal’s falling to even No. 5 unlikely.
In a news conference Monday at the Western & Southern Open in Mason, Federer, Nadal’s longtime rival, expressed surprise at how much time Nadal had already missed.
“I can’t believe he’s been out that long,” Federer said. “I thought: the Olympics, O.K., that’s fine. That’s a personal choice. I thought for sure we would see him in Toronto, but now he missed Toronto and Cincinnati.
“It’s very surprising, because it was nothing that we heard of before the injury. He played so well on clay and then actually seemed fine at Wimbledon. He had more time by losing earlier at Wimbledon. So it came as a big surprise now, these two pullouts for me. Even the Olympics, too. So I’m sad for him.”
Djokovic, who has played Nadal in four of the last five Grand Slam finals, said the problem must be fairly serious for Nadal to miss a couple of months of play. “I’m sure that if he was able to perform in U.S. Open, he would come,” Djokovic said in Ohio. “So I wish him a quick recovery, obviously.”
Murray, the Olympic champion who is playing in Ohio, said, “I hope he can rest, doesn’t come back too early, and gets them fixed so he can get back to playing his best tennis.”
After confirming the withdrawal on Twitter, Nadal’s public relations manager, Benito Perez-Barbadillo, criticized those who were writing off Nadal’s chances of fully recovering from this injury setback.
“I remember people saying that Rafa would never win Wimbledon,” Perez-Barbadillo said in a Twitter message. “He did win it twice and how many finals?”
