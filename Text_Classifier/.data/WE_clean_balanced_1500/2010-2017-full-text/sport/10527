World Athletics Championships: Ashton Eaton sets new decathlon world record in Beijing
Ashton Eaton's world record in the decathlon has stolen the limelight from Mo Farah and Usain Bolt on the penultimate night of the world athletics championships in Beijing.
Farah completed the long distance double for a second consecutive occasion at a world titles with victory in the men's 5,000 metres final, while Usain Bolt captured his third gold in the Bird's Nest in the last seven days when he anchored Jamaica to a win in the men's 4x100m relay.
But it was Eaton who deserved top billing, after the American dipped under his world mark to post a two-day total of 9,045 points.
Eaton, the defending champion, collected 829 points in running four minutes and 17.52 seconds in the final event, the 1,500m, enough to beat his previous record by six points.
The fatigue that always follows 10 events was evident when the 27-year-old Olympic gold medallist, whose wife Brianne won silver for Canada in the heptathlon, crashed to the track after crossing the finish line.
But exhaustion soon turned to elation, as Eaton learned of his new world record that was highlighted by the sensational 400m performance he produced to end day one when he ran 45.00, the fastest ever one lap contested in a decathlon.
"I just came out there and told myself, 'Okay, let's enjoy this event and go for it'," Eaton said.
"The result is awesome but I did not do it alone."
Canada's Damian Warner won silver in a national record of 8,695 points and German Rico Freimuth claimed the bronze with 8,561 points.
Farah once again dominated a sprint finish to win his third successive world 5,000m crown.
The Briton won the 5,000m/10,000m double in Moscow in 2013 and he repeated the dose in Beijing to triumph in a time of 13:50.38.
Farah was a close second to Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku at the bell and the pair cleared out from their pursuers 200 metres from home.
Ndiku looked strong on the final bend but as he done so often Farah kicked at the ideal moment and collected his fifth world championships gold medal.
The Kenyan Ndiku had to be content with the silver medal in 13:51.75 and Ethiopia's Hagos Gebrhiwet won bronze in 13:51.86.
"The important thing is to win the race and I did that," said Farah, who will look to defend his 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic crowns in Rio de Janiero next year.
"It felt amazing, incredible to win the double."
Bolt had already won two gold medals in Beijing, with his victories in the 100m and 200m.
Both times he beat Justin Gatlin to the top of the podium and although they did not quite face off in the final - the American ran the second leg and Bolt the fourth - it was the Jamaican who again had the last laugh.
Bolt tore down the home straight to stop the clock in 37.36 before enjoying the win with his team-mates Asafa Powell, Nesta Carter and Nickel Ashmeade.
The US had crossed the line second but was later disqualified following a disastrous baton change between Tyson Gay and Mike Rodgers on the last leg.
China (38.01) was elevated to the silver and Canada (38.13) the bronze.
Bolt now has 11 world championships gold medals and it is the fifth occasion in which he has added the 4x100m relay to his 100m and 200m wins at a major.
"I would like to give thanks to the team," Bolt said.
"The relay is my favourite event."
Jamaica had earlier won the women's 4x100m relay final in a championship record time of 41.07.
