Bomb Injures at Least Five in Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A powerful car bomb explosion rocked a neighborhood south of Lebanon’s capital early Tuesday, wounding several people, a Lebanese security official and witnesses said.
The explosion was just after midnight south of Beirut near a checkpoint and the Abu Assaf cafe, where people had gathered to watch World Cup soccer matches. The official said that the explosion appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber and that at least five people were wounded. He spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations.
It was the second blast in a week and comes amid mounting regional tensions over the events in nearby Iraq, where the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has seized territory in northern and western Iraq.
