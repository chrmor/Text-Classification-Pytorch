Preemptive evacuation in CDO as floods, landslides hit South
Cagayan de Oro City is now under “orange alert,” paving the way for preemptive evacuation of residents near the Cagayan de Oro River as large parts of the city and some parts of Visayas and Mindanao are inundated due to rains induced by a low pressure area and tail end of the cold front.
Social welfare secretary Judy Taguiwalo, in a Facebook post late Monday, January 16, relayed the announcement by Cagayan de Oro City’s Information Office for residents to proceed to evacuation centers or higher ground.
Eleven barangays have been identified for preemptive evacuation by the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council:
Taguiwalo said the city is experiencing flash floods and landslides, with DSWD Field Office 10 staff reporting they are stranded in the office but are on standby for disaster operations.
A rescue operation is also launched for some 300 students trapped inside the Mindanao University of Science and Technology.
Some photos she shared on Facebook show submerged roads in the city, reminiscent of the deluge caused by Tropical Storm Sendong in 2011.
Some towns in Leyte are also flooded, DSWD Field Office 8 reported:
There are also 21 families evacuated to the the municipal building in Quinapondan,Eastern Samar.
More rains are forecast over much of Visayas and Mindanao amid the presence of a low pressure area and the tail-end of a cold front.
