India has hanged Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the only militant to have survived the 2008 attacks on the financial capital Mumbai.
The home ministry has confirmed the execution.
The Times Of India says president Pranab Mukherjee earlier rejected a mercy petition filed by Kasab.
The Pakistan-born Kasab was one of 10 gunmen who laid siege to the city in November 2008 attacks that lasted nearly three days and killed 166 people.
Kasab was sentenced to death in May 2010 after he was found guilty of a string of charges, including waging war against India, murder and terrorist acts.
He appealed in the Supreme Court claiming he did not receive a fair trial but his petition was struck down in August.
During the 2008 attacks, the heavily armed Islamist gunmen stormed targets in Mumbai including luxury hotels, a Jewish centre, a hospital and a bustling train station.
Kasab was a Pakistani national who said he belonged to the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba
