Matheus Nascimento collapses in Europa League final
Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk winger Matheus Nascimento collapses during the Europa League final against Sevilla in Warsaw.
Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk winger Matheus Nascimento collapsed during this evening's Europa League final against Sevilla in Warsaw.
The Brazilian was approached by his teammate moments after clashing heads with Benoit Tremoulinas, and proceeded to fall to the ground with no opposition player close to him.
Teammates immediately raced around the player and urgently called medical staff onto the field.
Doctors were quick to attend to Matheus, and carried him off the field without having administered lengthy medical treatment.
The incident did not appear to be as serious as first feared, however, and play soon resumed as Sevilla went on to lift the trophy courtesy of a 3-2 victory.
