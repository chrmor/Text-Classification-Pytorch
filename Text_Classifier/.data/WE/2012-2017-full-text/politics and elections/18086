Norway doubles humanitarian aid to Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) â€” Norway's foreign minister says his government has doubled humanitarian aid to Afghanistan to help the war-stricken nation meet urgent needs.
Borge Brende said Saturday that 2016 support will total around 200 million kroner, or $24 million.
The aid is for food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care and children's schooling. It will also help cover the costs of emergency needs for the internally displaced.
Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, has experienced armed conflict for almost 40 years with more than a million people displaced by the war.
The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says between Jan. 1 and April 30 this year, "117,976 people fled their homes due to conflict."
The U.N. says it has received 16 percent of funds needed for humanitarian assistance this year.
