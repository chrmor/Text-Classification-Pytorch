Two children drown in boat tragedy
Two children drowned and 21 people were rescued Wednesday morning after two boats collided in Lake Victoria.
The two children, identified as Fatou Bensouda, aged two, and four-year-old Eda Anyango were travelling with their mother to Kisumu.
The 21 were rescued by fishermen near Kiwa Island. Police said one of the boats was ferrying passengers and the other had fishermen on board.
Police from Nyandiwa and Mgingo and Remba islands led residents in the rescue operation.
County commander John Omusanga denied claims that there were 200 people on board the passenger boat.
