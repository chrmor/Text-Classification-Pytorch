Death toll hits 50 in Indian ferry sinking
At least 50 Muslim pilgrims drowned when an overcrowded ferry sank in eastern India, officials said on Monday, adding that more bodies may have been washed away or still be in the vessel.
The boat capsized on Saturday in a fast-flowing river in the state of West Bengal, 120km south of Kolkata.
"We have found 30 bodies during the day, taking the total dead to 50," state minister Kanti Ganguly told AFP. "We fear other bodies are under the boat.
"The search operation had to be suspended this afternoon as the weather was bad, but will be resumed in the morning."
Two bodies found on Monday were 20km from the accident.
The boat was badly overcrowded as it crossed the Muriganga river after a Muslim religious event, but the exact number of people on board was unknown.
