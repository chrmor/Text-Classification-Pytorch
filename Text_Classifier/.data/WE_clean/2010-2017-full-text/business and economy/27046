MP calls on Jeremy Corbyn to resign and 'make way for someone with the backbone to confront antisemitism' after he appears to compare Israel to 'various self-styled Islamic states and organisations'
Jeremy Corbyn has appeared to compare Israel to "various self-styled Islamic states and organisations" at the launch of Labour's antisemitism report.
He said: "Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the Netanyahu Government than our Muslim friends are for those of various self-styled Islamic states or organisations."
