Japan diplomats to boycott Korean Air
TOKYO (MarketWatch) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto has told his ministry officials not to fly on Korean Air for one month from next Monday to protest at a demonstration flight by the airline last month above disputed islets in the Sea of Japan, Kyodo News reported Thursday, citing government sources.
Matsumoto has aired concerns over the June 16 flight over the South Korean-controlled islets known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea, describing the incident as "a violation of Japan's airspace."
His instruction, the first ever step targeted at a private airline in connection with a territorial dispute, triggered an instant backlash from Seoul. Through diplomatic channels, the South Korean government conveyed regret and urged Tokyo to immediately revoke the measure.
A South Korean official told Kyodo News that Seoul "cannot accept any protest" over the islets based on its sovereignty claim.
An Airbus A380 passenger jet operated by Korean Air entered airspace above the disputed islets a day before it went into service between Seoul and Tokyo. The jet carried executives of the airline as well as South Korean and foreign reporters.
