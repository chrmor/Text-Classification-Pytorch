Boyd-Barrett takes last Dún Laoghaire seat
People Before Profit candidate Richard Boyd-Barrett, running under the United Left Alliance ticket, has taken the fourth and final seat in Dún Laoghaire.
Mr Boyd Barrett was elected without reaching the quota on the eleventh count, pipping Fianna Fáil deputy leader Mary Hanafin to the last seat.
Labour leader Eamon Gilmore and Fine Gael’s Sean Barrett were formally elected last night.
Fine Gael’s Mary Mitchell O’Connor took the third seat on the tenth count after  Labour’s Ivan Bacik was eliminated on the ninth count.
Former Fianna Fáil minister Barry Andrews and outgoing Green Party TD Ciaran Cuffe were eliminated yesterday.
The count was suspended last night after a full recount was requested by the Labour Party.
The request was withdrawn this afternoon after the votes of Mr Boyd Barrett were rechecked. It was found that any discrepancy was insufficient to bridge the gap of 147 votes between Boyd Barrett and Ms Bacik and she was eliminated.
Speaking this afternoon, Ms Hanafin said she would not be retiring from politics. “Politics is in my blood and public service is in my bones, so I certainly see myself continuing in some role”.
She claimed the party could rebuild itself but admitted having only one TD in Dublin and no women was a "particular worry".
