Obama sets out plans for the Middle East
President Obama has given his strongest support yet for the uprisings across the Middle East, saying he wants to use this "historic opportunity" to spread reform across the region.
Mr Obama had a tough message for regimes like Libya, Syria and Bahrain but also controversially for Israel.
He stressed the need for any future Palestinian state to be based on the borders before the 1967 war but that prompted an angry response from the Israeli Prime Minister who is due to visit the White House tomorrow.
Mr Obama has been speaking exclusively to the BBC as Mark Mardell reports.
