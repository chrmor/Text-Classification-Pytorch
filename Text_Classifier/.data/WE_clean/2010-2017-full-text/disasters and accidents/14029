At least ten people were killed and 26 injured after a passenger bus plunged about 300 meters (985 feet) into a ravine and sunk in a river in the north of Bolivia, local media reported.
MEXICO, January 22 (RIA Novosti) - At least ten people were killed and 26 injured after a passenger bus plunged about 300 meters (985 feet) into a ravine and sunk in a river in the north of Bolivia, local media reported.
The tragic accident occurred on a mountainous road in the Bolivian region of Yungas. Rescuers say the number of victims might climb as many people were carried away by the current of the river.
According to the International Automobile Federation, some 1,000 people die in road accidents in Bolivia annually, while 50,000 receive injuries.
In 2010 President Evo Morales’ administration passed a legislature that clamped down on bus drivers caught working drunk or in excessive hours, as well as on inexperienced drivers, in order to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
