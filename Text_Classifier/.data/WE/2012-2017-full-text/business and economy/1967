Declaring Civil War in Syria Is No Longer an Overstatement

The conflict in Syria isn't officially labeled a civil war but the denomination gained new validity in the last 24 hours following a series of developments on the ground including land grabs and weapons buildups. Here's are some of the latest reasons why at least one United Nations official is already using the term. 
Heavy Weapons. In today's New York Times, Mark Landler and Neil MacFarquhar report that new powerful weapons are flowing into opposition groups and the government, causing a sharp escalation of the conflict. The most sophisticated are attack helicopters allegedly sent from Russia to the Assad regime, but rebels are arming up as well. "The fierce government assaults from the air are partly a response to improved tactics and weaponry among the opposition forces, which have recently received more powerful antitank missiles from Turkey, with the financial support of Saudi Arabia and Qatar," they report. "The increased ferocity of the attacks and the more lethal weapons on both sides threatened to overwhelm diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis."
