Four Marines and Gunman Dead in Rampage at Tennessee Military Facilities
A gunman unleashed a barrage of gunfire at two military centers in Chattanooga Thursday, killing four Marines, injuring a police officer and a Marine recruiter, and critically injuring a Navy sailor, authorities said.
The gunman was killed after a shootout with police at the second facility, authorities said. An autopsy is pending, and it is not clear whether police killed him or he killed himself.
The gunman was identified as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, 24. He was a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait, a federal official said.
"It is incomprehensible to see what happened and the way individuals who proudly serve our country were treated,‚Äù Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said.
Authorities offered no immediate information on a motive. Bill Killian, the top federal prosecutor for eastern Tennessee, said the attack was being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism.
The shootings began at around 10:45 a.m. and occurred over about 30 minutes and six miles apart, first at a military recruitment station and then at a Navy and Marines reserve center. A defense official said the gunman used an automatic weapon. Officials said he was armed with numerous weapons.
