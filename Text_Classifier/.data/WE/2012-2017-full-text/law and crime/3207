Aseem to join Binayak campaign
MUMBAI: Aseem Trivedi , the Kanpur-based self-publishing cartoonist facing sedition charges , was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 5,000 by the Bombay high court on a lawyer's PIL on Tuesday. Not wanting to come across as non-cooperative, he finally signed the bond on Wednesday and stepped out of Arthur Road jail. A posse of policemen kept an eye and about 50-60 members of NGO India Against Corruption shouted, 'Aseem aage badho, desh tumhare saath hai', as the youth was garlanded by India against Corruption coordinator Mayank Gandhi. A mike soon materialized, and Trivedi gave an impromptu speech, vowing to continue his fight against the sedition law. "This is the same section under which Pandit Nehru, Lokmanya Tilak and Gandhiji were booked. It should be scrapped now. It is against freedom of expression... Our battle will not end here," he said. Trivedi leaves for Delhi on Thursday and then most probably onwards to Washington, to collect the 'Courage in Editorial Cartooning' award, presented by the US-based Cartoonists Rights Network International, along with Syrian Atif Farjat, on September 15. Commenting on his future plans, Trivedi said he would intensify his protest through cartoons, by gheraoing ministers' homes and participating in rights activist Binayak Sen's campaign to repeal the sedition law. Trivedi deflected suggestions his cartoons may have hurt sentiments, saying, "I'm not a criminal. My cartoons are not offensive. My work was like a mirror reflecting the truth. Politicians exchanged cash in the Parliament, watched porn in the Karnataka assembly. Isn't that shameful and insulting?" Later in the afternoon, he was honoured at the Mumbai Press Club, where he joined hands with activist Sen, who also has sedition charges against him . Asked if he had seen Trivedi's work, Sen said: "I am not here to comment on his cartoons. I am here to support Aseem as our common cause is against the law of sedition."
