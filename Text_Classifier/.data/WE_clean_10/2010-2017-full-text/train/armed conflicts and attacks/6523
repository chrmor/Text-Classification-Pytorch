Pakistan Taliban: Military 'kills five militants'
Pakistani security forces have attacked Taliban positions in two operations near Peshawar, killing five fighters, the military says.
The operation comes days after the Taliban stormed a Peshawar school, killing 141 people, mostly children.
Pakistan is on alert, with security stepped up at prisons following the execution of jailed militants.
There are fears that Taliban may attack prisons to free militants due to be executed.
Pakistan decided to lift a moratorium on executions in response to Tuesday's school attack.
The first executions were carried out on Friday, among them a former soldier sentenced for attacking the army headquarters in 2009.
Pakistan has announced it will execute more militant prisoners in the next few days.
The UN Human Rights office in Pakistan appealed to the government to reinstate the moratorium, saying it would feed into a cycle of revenge.
Pakistan has ordered the military to help secure prisons to thwart any attempt by the Taliban to free prisoners.
Following the Peshawar attack the Pakistani military launched fresh offensives against the Taliban across the country.
Dozens of insurgents are reported to have been killed.
Officials also say they are aware of a plan by the Taliban to capture the children of army officers with a view to trading them for prisoners.
Meanwhile in neighbouring Afghanistan, Nato air strikes killed five militants near the Pakistan border, according to a statement on Saturday from the International Security Assistance Forces (Isaf).
It added that Isaf commander Gen Campbell was invited to take part in high-level talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan's army chief Gen Raheel Sharif.
Foreign combat troops are due to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan at the end of the year.
