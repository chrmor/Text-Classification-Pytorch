Morocco Says It Foiled Terrorist Cell
The Moroccan government arrested 27 people accused of operating a terrorist cell in Western Sahara led by a member of the local branch of Al Qaeda, officials said Wednesday.
The group was planning suicide and car bomb attacks against Moroccan and foreign security forces as well as bank robberies in Rabat and Casablanca to finance their activities, the interior minister, Tayeb Cherkaoui, said at a news conference carried by state news media.
The group’s leader, the minister said, was a Moroccan member of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in North Africa and has camps in neighboring Algeria, Mauritania and northern Mali. The goal was to set up a “rear base” for terrorism planning, he said.
A Moroccan security official said the cell had “links with extremists of different nationalities in European countries.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.
Mr. Cherkaoui gave few details about the timing or location of the arrests, but said the authorities had captured a cache of weapons, including 30 Kalashnikov rifles, two rocket-propelled-grenade launchers and several handguns at three sites around Amgala, an oasis town in a disputed area of Western Sahara. Investigators also seized maps of the border region between Algeria and Morocco.
Morocco governs Western Sahara, a territory on the Atlantic coast the size of Colorado, but has long faced violent opposition from the Polisario Front, a separatist group based in Algeria. The simmering conflict boiled over in November in the desert city of Laayoune, about 130 miles from Amgala, as knife-wielding gangs attacked unarmed Moroccan security officers, killing 11.
