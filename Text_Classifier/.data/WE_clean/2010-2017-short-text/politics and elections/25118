North Carolina's controversial voter ID law is in effect for the first time. Voters without these new ID credentials, including voters with a “reasonable impediment” to obtaining an ID, can cast a provisional ballot. Citizens (2,567) faced this problem during early voting, including U.S. Senator Richard Burr who, because his driver's license was stolen, was without ID. In addition, votes for congressional candidates for House seats don't count because the state's congressional district map was redrawn after the ballots were printed. The actual congressional primary is scheduled for June 7.
