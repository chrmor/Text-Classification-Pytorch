Louise Mensch MP email threats: Man arrested
A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of making threats to the Conservative MP Louise Mensch via email and social networking sites.
The Metropolitan Police said the man was arrested in Gloucester as part of an investigation into "malicious communication and threats".
Mrs Mensch, the MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, had previously claimed "morons" had threatened her.
She added that threats had also been made against her three children.
While on holiday in New York, the MP used her Twitter feed to say: "To those who sent it; get stuffed losers.
"I have contacted the police via the House of Commons and the email is with them now. I don't bully easily, kids. Or in fact at all."
