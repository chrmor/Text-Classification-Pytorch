Tropical Storm Beryl Threatens the Southeast
Beaches along the southern Atlantic coast were closed on Sunday, and visitors and residents in some low-lying regions were told to seek higher ground as Tropical Storm Beryl threatened to upset holiday weekend plans for thousands of beachgoers.
By Sunday afternoon, the waves had picked up and sharp winds had begun to lash northern Florida and southern Georgia.
Chris Souby, a lifeguard on duty in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said that officials were keeping swimmers out of the water and preparing for the worst.
“The storm is expected to make landfall around high tide, so we’re expecting some flooding,” Mr. Souby said.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported late Sunday that the storm was making landfall along the northeastern coast of Florida, according to The Associated Press.
