Haiti presidential and partial legislative runoff elections postponed
The Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) informs the general public, political parties and candidates in particular, that the elections of local authorities and the partial parliamentary and presidential ballot which were scheduled for December 27, 2015, have been postponed.
The Council, due to the formation of the National electoral assessment Commission and taking account of the implications that its recommendations may have on the continuation of the electoral calendar, has so decided.
The CEP, therefore, strongly encourages the actors to do everything to facilitate the eventual conduct of the electoral process and reiterates its determination to do everything possible for the holding of free, fair, inclusive and democratic elections.
