Harman says sorry for 'ginger rodent' jibe
Deputy Labour leader's joke about Danny Alexander backfires as she is accused of insulting all of Scotland's redheads
Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, was forced to apologise today for branding a senior coalition minister a "ginger rodent" during a scathing attack on the Liberal Democrats.
Harman, usually known for her political correctness, admitted she had been "wrong" to use the description about Lib Dem chief treasury secretary Danny Alexander in a speech.
The jibe was the most personal of a number aimed at political opponents in Harman's address to the Scottish Labour party conference in Oban. "Many of us in the Labour party are conservationists and we all love the red squirrel," she said. "But there's one ginger rodent we never want to see in the Highlands of Scotland – Danny Alexander."
She went on to say that every Lib Dem MP and MSP had "mutated into something alien to Scotland – Tories".
The remark about Alexander, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, was greeted with laughter in the hall. However, it backfired as Harman found herself accused of insulting all Scotland's redheads.
George Lyon, Scottish Liberal Democrat election chair, said: "There are no depths to which Labour will not stoop. They aren't fit to be in opposition, let alone in government."
The SNP also criticised the Labour deputy leader. Nationalist MSP Shirley-Anne Somerville said the high number of redheads in Scotland meant the "silly remark isn't anti-Danny or anti-Lib Dem, it's anti-Scottish".
Somerville, herself a redhead, said: "Coming from the doyenne of po-faced political correctness, these remarks show she and Labour have lost the plot since losing the election."
On the social networking site Twitter, Alexander said: "I am proud to be ginger and rodents do valuable work cleaning up mess others leave behind."
