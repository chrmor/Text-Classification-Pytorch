Kim Jong-eun has plot to disrupt G20: RFA
North Korea recently held a meeting, presided by Kim Jong-eun, the heir-apparent of Kim Jong-il, to disrupt the upcoming G20 summit in Seoul, a report said Wednesday. Citing a high-level North Korean cadre, who recently visited Pyongyang to attend the Workers’ Party conference, Radio Free Asia said North Korea’s National Defense Commission, the North’s de facto most powerful organ, held an emergency meeting to compromise the G20 meeting, slated for Nov. 11-12 in Seoul. The meeting was presided over by junior Kim, who was entrusted by his father, the head of the commission. “The defense commission regards the G20 meeting as a plot by world financial powers to isolate North Korea internationally,” RFA said. “To prevent it from happening, a concrete set of measures were discussed.” It’s not clear from the report what the measures were. It’s also not known whether the participants have agreed to carry them out. But the RFA said that North Korea will stir security concerns in South Korea around the time of holding the G20 and support various South Korean civic organizations that oppose the get-together and engage in a negative campaign against the meeting within South Korea.
