Judge Declares Mistrial of Baltimore Cop in Freddie Gray Case
Gray's death and the subsequent unrest in Baltimore brought to the fore long-simmering tensions in the city and across the nation over socioeconomic disparity and the relationship betweenlaw enforcement and the minority communities they serve.
Prosecutors considered Porterâ€™s case key to strengthening the case against Caesar Goodson Jr., who was driving the van. It was also seen as a signal of how the trials of the five other officers could go.
The remaining trials are set for early next year. It is unclear how the mistrial will affect the prosecution's approach on the other trials, if at all.

The judge scheduled conferences Thursday to "discuss a new trial date," indicating that he expects prosecutors to try Porter again. Williams gave Porter the option to appear Thursday, but he declined.
"You've been diligent," Williams told the jury. "Thank you for your diligence."
Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby was in court for the announcement, but she, like all parties in the case, is still under a gag order until all six officers' trials are complete.
Porter and the defense and the prosecution attorneys all looked tense when the judge spoke to them privately before making the announcement to the court. Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe could be seen shaking her head.
During arguments, prosecutors focused on what they said was Porter's failure to take care of Gray while he was in custody by not getting him medical care or buckling his seatbelt.
Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow said Porter, 26, "criminally neglected his duty to keep Mr. Gray safe."
The prosecution painted Porter, who grew up in the same neighborhood as Gray, as an affable young man who made good on his life.
