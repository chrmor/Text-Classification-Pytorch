Bahrain recalls its ambassador from Syria Monday
Dubai:Â Bahrain has recalled its ambassador from Syria for "consultation," Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmad Al Khalifa said on Monday, following the example of neighbours Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
King Abdullah of oil-rich Saudi Arabia led the way on on Sunday when he strongly condemned the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Syria and recalled Riyadh's envoy from Damascus.
