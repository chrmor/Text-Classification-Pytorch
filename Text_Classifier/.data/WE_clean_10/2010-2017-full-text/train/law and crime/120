Reeva Steenkamp's brother: 'We want to remember her goodness'
There will be a private memorial service on Tuesday for Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead last week at the South Africa home of the athlete Oscar Pistorius.
The 29-year-old will then be cremated in her home city, Port Elizabeth.
At around the same time, her boyfriend is due in court in Pretoria, for a bail hearing. Oscar Pistorius denies a charge of pre-meditated murder.
On the eve of the funeral, Reeva Steenkamp's brother Adam said the family wanted to remember his sister and ''all the goodness that she stood for''.
