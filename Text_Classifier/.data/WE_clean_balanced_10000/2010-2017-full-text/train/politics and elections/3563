Live Blog: Presidential Debate in Iran -- Foreign Policy
Iran’s third and final election debate on Friday was lively, entertaining, and heated. The eight presidential hopefuls outlined their foreign and domestic policies. As expected, Iran's faltering economy, the election's main campaign issue, took center stage. The candidates blamed the country’s financial woes on the government’s mishandling of the economy, while others pointed the finger at crunching international sanctions. Iran’s nuclear discussions with the West also sparked heated exchanges. Said Jalili, the top nuclear negotiator, attracted criticism for what his rivals called his failure to stand up for the country’s nuclear right. The candidates also blamed him for not doing enough to secure the removal of sanctions targeting the country’s oil and financial sector. Most of the candidates agreed that the country needed to repair its image and pursue better ties with regional countries and the wider international community. Candidates will now have little less than a week for campaigning before the vote on June 14.
