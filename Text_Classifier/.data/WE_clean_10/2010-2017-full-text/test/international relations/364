Thai lawmaker arrested along Cambodia border
Cambodian authorities say seven Thais, including a member of Parliament, have been arrested after illegally crossing the border into Cambodia. Provincial police chief Hun Hean says it has yet to be decided whether to release the group or take legal action. The arrests occurred Wednesday opposite the Thai province of Sa Kaew. A Thai Foreign Ministry official in Bangkok confirmed the incident, saying the group was inspecting a disputed area along the frontier. The lawmaker was identified as Panich Vikitsreth of the ruling Democrat party.
