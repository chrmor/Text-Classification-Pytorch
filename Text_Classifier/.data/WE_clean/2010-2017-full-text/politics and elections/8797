Prison hunger strikers now number 12,000, advocates say [Updated]
Advocates for California prison inmates conducting a hunger strike said the number of participants has swelled to 12,000, making it possibly the largest prison strike in recent U.S. history. 
The inmates are eight days into a renewed hunger strike after they suspended a previous strike in July.
[Updated at 4:12 p.m. Monday: State corrections officials said the number of striking inmates is far lower than reported by advocates. As of Monday, officials said there are 1,245 inmates at four prisons who have missed nine or more consecutive meals since Sept. 26. The number of inmates who had missed nine or more consecutive meals peaked Sept. 29 with 4,252 inmates at eight state prisons.]
They began the most recent strike to call attention to conditions, including lengthy stints in solitary confinement.
In California prisons, suspected gang members may be held in isolation indefinitely, a practice that prison officials say is necessary to keep order and prevent violence but that inmates call inhumane. 
Inmates agreed to start eating three weeks into the initial strike in July in exchange for warm hats, wall calendars and a promise from prison officials to reconsider the isolation regulations.
