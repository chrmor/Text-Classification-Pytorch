Evacuation of rebels from Damascus district complete, city governor says
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The last group of rebels and other people who wanted to leave the besieged Barzeh district of Damascus have done so, the Syrian capitalâ€™s governor was quoted as saying on Monday by state television, bringing it under state control.
Some 1,012 people, including 455 fighters, left Barzeh in a bus convoy for rebel-held parts of northern Syria as part of an agreement between the government and insurgents, state TV said.
