Lionel Messi breaks Gerd Muller's record of most goals in a European season
Barcelona attacker Lionel Messi has broken Gerd Muller's record of scoring the most goals in a European season after scoring a hat-trick in the Liga encounter against Malaga at Camp Nou.The Germany legend netted 67 times for Bayern Munich in the 1972-73 campaign, a feat that was not bettered until the Argentina international completed his hat-trick in Catalunya on Wednesday.The forward converted a spot kick in the 35th minute, then doubled his tally with another penalty at the hour mark to equal Muller, before completing his hat-trick in the 64th minute. Messi started the season with a single goal in the 2-2 Spanish Supercopa draw against Real Madrid, and has since gone on to reach landmark after landmark.The Argentina international already broke Barca's all-time official scoring record earlier in the campaign at the tender age of 24. Messi also became the first player in the Champions League era to score five goals in a single match, when he achieved the feat against Bayer Leverkusen on March 7, while joining Jose Altafini as the highest scorer in a single European Cup campaign with 14 strikes.The 24-year-old has netted 46 times in the Primera Division, 14 in the Champions League, three in the Spanish Supercup, twice in the Copa del Rey, twice in the Club World Cup, and once in the European Supercup.Messi has three more opportunities to add to his tally this season, as Barca face Espanyol, Betis and Athletic Bilbao (Copa del Rey) in their last three games of the 2011-12 campaign.
