27 FARC died in bombing
Colombia’s National Police chief Oscar Naranjo on Monday said 27 guerrillas were killed in the bombing of a FARC camp in the south of the country on Sunday. Among the dead is one of the FARC’s national political leaders.
According to Naranjo, surviving guerrillas removed five corpses of prominent rebels from the site, where approximately 60 members of the FARC’s 48th Front were staying.
The FARC’s 48th Front is thought to be responsible for a recent attack on the town of San Miguel in the Putumayo department that killed eight policemen.
