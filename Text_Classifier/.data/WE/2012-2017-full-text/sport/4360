4-year doping ban sought for Italian race walker
MILAN -- The Italian Olympic Committee has requested a four-year doping ban for former Olympic race walk champion Alex Schwazer.
Schwazer was excluded from the London Olympics after testing positive for EPO before the games.
On Thursday, the Italian committee's prosecutor asked the anti-doping court to impose the maximum four-year ban.
The 27-year-old Schwazer won the 50-kilometer event at the 2008 Beijing Games. He maintains he was clean at those Olympics.
Schwazer failed an out-of-competition test before arriving in London and was removed from Italy's team before competing. He then said he used the blood-boosting hormone EPO and was quitting the sport.
Schwazer also has acknowledged that he consulted with Lance Armstrong's banned sport doctor, Michele Ferrari.
