Singapore ruling party in decisive election win
Bangkok: Millions of Singaporeans have swept aside hopes that a two-party state could emerge on their tropical island with the ruling party securing an increased mandate in a snap poll.
The People's Action Party secured 83 of 89 seats in parliament, an almost 10 per cent increase on the last election in 2011.
Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong declared early on Saturday that Singaporeans had given him a clear and fresh mandate in the first election since the death of modern Singapore's founder Lee Kuan Yew in March.
"This election results show that Singaporeans understand what is at stakeâ€¦that we can prosper only if we stayed united," he said.
