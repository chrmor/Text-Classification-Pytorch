Early official results show the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the country's largest opposition party, has a slim lead over Prime Minister Zoran Milanović’s ruling Social Democrats (SDP) in today's elections. With 32 percent counted, the HDZ, has 61 of parliament’s 151 seats and the SDP is second with 53. The third place Most (Bridge of Independent Lists) party is likely to have the balance of power in the parliament. (Wall Street Journal) (Bloomberg) (The Guardian) After the votes were counted, HDZ had 59 seats and SDP 56, and with 3 additional seats from the regional IDS party, SDP amounted to 59 seats. The greatest surprise was MOST, who won 19 seats and will be the key in formation of the government. If MOST refuses coalition with the two main parties, the country will have to repeat the elections in January 2016.
