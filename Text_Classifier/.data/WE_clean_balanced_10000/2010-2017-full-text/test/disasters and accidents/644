France urged to repay Haiti $A24 billion
A group of intellectuals and politicians called on Monday for France to repay Haiti 17 billion euros ($A27.21 billion) extorted by its former colonial master in exchange for recognition of its independence 200 years ago.
The left-leaning French and British dailies Liberation and The Guardian published the appeal to President Nicolas Sarkozy.
It was signed by figures including American linguist Noam Chomsky, Canadian author Naomi Klein and a number of philosophers and politicians.
The letter said the money would cover rebuilding costs in Haiti after January's devastating earthquake that killed more than 250,000 people, as it would cover the shortfall in cash promised by international donors.
"The 'independence debt', which is today valued at over 17 billion euros ($A23.51 billion) illegitimately forced a people who had won their independence in a successful slave revolt, to pay again for the freedom," the letter said.
If Haiti did not pay up, France threatened to invade and restore slavery.
