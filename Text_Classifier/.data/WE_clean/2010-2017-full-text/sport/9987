Fabrice Muamba 'showing small signs of improvement' as his heart beats unaided
A joint statement from Barts and the London NHS Trust said: "Fabrice Muamba remains in intensive care at the London Chest Hospital, where today he is showing small signs of improvement.
"His heart is now beating without the help of medication and he is also moving his arms and his legs. However his long-term prognosis will remain unclear for some time.
"He is still critically ill and will continue to be closely monitored and treated by staff in the London Chest Hospital's intensive care unit."
The positive update will be gratefully received by those who have spent the day at Muamba's bedside, and by the millions of football fans who have been eagerly awaiting updates.
