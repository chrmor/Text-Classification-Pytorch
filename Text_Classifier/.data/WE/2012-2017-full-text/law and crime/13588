Cops raid 1MDB office - Nation
PETALING JAYA: The police are raiding the office of 1MDB at Jalan Sultan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur.
The raids began at around 10.00am on Wednesday and are still ongoing.
A check by The Star confirmed that police were present at the office located at Menara IMC.
The Star journalists were not allowed access to the office but was informed by a receptionist that the police and 1MDB gave instructions not to allow anyone to their office, located on level 8.
"Even the despatch people are not allowed in as they don't want to be disturbed," said the receptionist.
A security officer even said no recording of footages is allowed on the premise of Menara IMC.
Spotted outside were three police patrol cars and a van.
A special task force comprising Bank Negara Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akthar Aziz, Attorney General Tan Sri Abdul Patail, IGP Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar and MACC chief Tan Sri Abu Kassim Mohamed has been investigating the 1MDB trail.
The task force has frozen six bank accounts and is said to be investigating 17 others involved in 1MDB funds.
The task force has seized documents during raids on 1MDB-linked companies - SRC International Sdn Bhd, Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd which allegedly were used to channel funds into what WSJ claims were the personal accounts of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.
The IGP told reporters on Wednesday morning that the police were investigating how the Wall Street Journal obtained access to bank documents which it uploaded on its website on Tuesday.
