El Faro Search Ends Without Finding 'Black Box'
The National Transportation Safety Board says it has completed its search and video documentation of the sunken El Faro, but did not find its voyage data recorder, also known as a black box.
The cargo ship went missing on Oct. 1 during Hurricane Joaquin with 33 crew members aboard and was located on Oct. 31 near Crooked Island in the Bahamas in 15,000 foot-deep water.
NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart said in a press release, “While it is disappointing that the voyage data recorder was not located, we are hopeful that we’ll be able to determine the probable cause of this tragedy and the factors that may have contributed to it.”
The NTSB does not have any further search missions planned.
