Adele leads nominations for 57th Ivor Novello awards
Singer competes against Kate Bush and PJ Harvey in album of the year category
It has been a record-breaking 15 months for Adele, and now she has received four nominations – more than any other artist – for the 57th Ivor Novello awards.
The 23-year-old singer's Rolling in the Deep finds itself in the categories for best song musically and lyrically and the PRS for Music most performed work, where it is joined by a second hit from her album 21, Someone Like You.
Having won the Grammy award for album of the year and the Brit award for British album of the year, 21 is also nominated in the Ivors' album award category, alongside Kate Bush's 50 Words for Snow and PJ Harvey's Let England Shake.
The Ivor Novello awards celebrate excellence in songwriting and are judged by the songwriting and composing community. They are presented by Basca – the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, which has 2,000 members – in association with PRS for Music. Previous winners include Sir Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Amy Winehouse, Sting, Annie Lennox and Radiohead.
This year's awards take place on Thursday 17 May at the Grosvenor House hotel in London.
