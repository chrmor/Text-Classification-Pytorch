South Sudan returnee train attacked in South Kordofan
A train carrying South Sudanese back home from the north has been attacked by a northern Arab group, leaving one person dead, the UN says.
A UN spokeswoman said the train was attacked by Misseriya gunmen in South Kordofan state on Sunday, although this was denied by a Misseriya leader.
At least 70,000 people have fled recent fighting in South Kordofan, which borders South Sudan.
Tension has been rising ahead of the south's independence next month.
Another 100,000 people have been forced from their homes after fighting in the disputed town of Abyei, near South Kordofan.
Since the end of the 21-year north-south war, some two million southerners have returned home and more are going ahead of the formal declaration of independence due on 9 July.
"A train transport of southern Sudanese returnees going from Kosti to Wau was attacked by Misseriya militia," said UN spokeswoman Hua Jiang.
However, Misseriya leader Mohamed Omer al-Ansary said the attack had been carried out by rebels in the neighbouring region of Darfur, where a separate conflict broke out in 2003.
Northern forces have been accused of bombing parts of South Kordofan inhabited by ethnic Nubans, who largely supported the south during the civil war.
The fighting broke out after pro-southern groups were ordered to disarm after Ahmed Haroun was declared the winner of recent governorship elections.
Mr Haroun is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.
Over the weekend, Mr Haroun said the situation was now safe and people have started to return to their homes.
However, human rights group Amnesty International accused the authorities of forcing the displaced to go home despite continuing violence.
The Sudanese air force is accused of carrying out more bombing raids on Saturday.
