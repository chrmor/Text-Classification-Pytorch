Gunman opens fire at El Paso VA hospital, shooting dead doctor before committing suicide
Gunfire rang out in a Texas military hospital on Tuesday, as a gunman shot dead a doctor before committing suicide.
The William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso  was shut down for about an hour Tuesday afternoon, after reports of a person carrying a gun near the adjacent El Paso VA Health Care System clinic. 
Military and local police responding to the scene then conducted a search of the clinic and found the shooter's body, Major General Stephen Twitty said at an evening press conference.
Authorities say the shooter killed one other person, previously reported to be a doctor. The FBI is now leading the investigation, and have not yet released the identities of the shooter or victim.
'Everything is under control and there is no immediate threat to Fort Bliss or the immediate community,' Twitty said Tuesday night.
A woman who at the scene today toldBuzzfeedthat she was leaving the clinic when military police started rushing into the building.
During the panic, she says she heard a woman shouting for a medic from what appeared to be the fourth floor.
A former clinic employee toldNewsChannel 9 that the clinic is connected to William Beaumont by a corridor.
The clinic has four floors, while the center has 11 floors and is one of the largest buildings in El Paso at 254,00 square feet. 
The center and clinic were shut down for about an hour before the gates were opened up and employees were allowed to leave.  
Photos taken at the scene when the hospital was first put in lockdown this afternoon show a heavy police presence, including SWAT teams. 
The El Paso PD responded to the scene around 4pm to assist Fort Bliss military officials with the situation.
