DNA test 'proves Fischer not girl's father'
A DNA test has determined that the late chess champion Bobby Fischer is not the father of a nine-year-old Filipino girl, her lawyer has said.
The Supreme Court in Reykjavik had ordered Mr Fischer's body exhumed to prove whether Jinky Young was Mr Fischer's daughter.
However, lawyer Thordur Bogason said the report "excluded Bobby Fisher".
The US-born chess player died in Iceland in 2008 but left no will. His estate is estimated at $2m (Â£1.4m).
"The DNA report excluded Bobby Fisher from being the father of Jinky Young, and therefore the case has come to a close," said Mr Bogason.
The other claimants to Mr Fischer's estate are Japanese woman Myoko Watai, who claims to be Mr Fischer's widow, and the chess master's two nephews.
The US government is also claiming unpaid taxes from the estate.
Jinky is the daughter of Marilyn Young, who had a relationship with Fischer while he was living in the Philippines.
Jinky lives in the Philippines with her mother but flew to Iceland last year to provide her own sample.
The court case over the inheritance dispute is still before a Reykjavik court and proceedings are expected to continue next month, Icelandic newspaper Morgunbladid reported.
