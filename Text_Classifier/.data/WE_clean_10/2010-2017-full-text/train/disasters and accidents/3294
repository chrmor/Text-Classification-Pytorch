Sandy's Grim Toll Rises in Battered East
The number of deaths in the U.S. attributed to Sandy rose to at least 90, nearly half in New York City, as millions of people in the Northeast went another day without power and continued to confront gas-station lines and patchy public transit.
More bodies were being found as police and firefighters continued "going block-by-block and door-to-door in the areas devastated by the hurricane," said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
