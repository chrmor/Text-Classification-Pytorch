Sarkozy visits Martinique, Guadeloupe
BASSE-TERRE, Guadeloupe, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy landed in Martinique late Friday, beginning a flying visit to two of his country's overseas departments.
Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, will move on to Guadeloupe Saturday, Radio France Internationale reported. The president is scheduled to give New Year's greetings Sunday to the 2.5 million people in the overseas departments.
President Barack Obama is to host the Sarkozys next week in Washington.
The visit is Sarkozy's first to Martinique and Guadeloupe. Both islands, which have staggering unemployment rates and high costs of living, were hit by six weeks of strikes in 2009.
Guadeloupe was also hit recently by flooding.
