Iraqi oil pipeline bombed
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A bomb planted under an oil pipeline exploded in northern Iraq preventing the flow of thousands of barrels of oil, an Oil Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
The pipeline in Ninevah province pumps about 500,000 barrels of crude oil every day to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, said spokesman Asim Jihad. It will take a few days to make repairs to the pipeline and resume pumping oil.
Last month, gunmen attacked Iraq's largest oil refinery, killing four workers and planting 10 bombs around a production unit. Authorities said it will take years to get the facility north of Baghdad up and running again.
The attacks on oil facilities are reminiscent of those carried out in the height of the Iraq war when terrorist groups targeted pipelines and refineries.
