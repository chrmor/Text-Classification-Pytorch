LIVE UPDATES: Operation Protective Edge, day 8 -  Haaretz - Israel News
Israel's security cabinet convened at 9 P.M. on Tuesday, 12 hours after accepting an Egyptian cease-fireproposal.  Several Hamas officials rejected the proposal, but sources said that Hamas was holding talks with Egypt on the matter and an official statement by the Hamas political leadership is expected later Tuesday.
Hamas fire intensified over the course of the day, with rockets launched toward south, central and north Israel. A civilian was killed after being hit with shrapnel near the Erez Crossing, on the Gaza border.
Since the operation began, Israel has launched more than 1,300 air strikes in Gaza which killed 202 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,100 people. Gaza hospitals are reporting a dire shortage of medicine and equipment, particularly for trauma injuries. 
More than 900 rockets and mortars have landed within Israel. Only a fraction landed in urban regions. The Iron Dome, which is only meant to intercept rockets that are headed for such areas, has an 87 percent success rate and has shot down 180 rockets over the course of the operation.
11:57 P.M. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is to travel to Cairo on Wednesday to meet with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi. Abbas' office said that the meeting is to focus on the implementation of the Egyptian cease-fire proposal. The Palestinian leader is to travel to Turkey on July 18 to meet with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also to discuss a truce between Israel and Gaza. (Jack Khoury)
11:49 P.M. Palestinian political officials slam Egypt's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire with Israel, claiming that the mediators' proposal ignored Hamas entirely.
"The Egyptians coordinated the initiative with Abbas and ignored Gaza," a senior PLO tells Haaretz. "Hamas leaders felt humiliated by the fact that the proposal was released without them being consulted about its contents ahead of time."
Spokespeople for Hamas and the Islamic Jihad blasted the Egyptian initiative as capitulation. Nevertheless, the groups signaled that they are studying the proposal. Senior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk tweeted that an official decision has yet to be made. (Jack Khoury)

8 P.M.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday evening that despite Israel's decision to accept the Egyptian cease-fire proposal, Hamas rejected it and continued fire. Hamas will pay the price for its actions.Anyone who tries to harm Israel, will be harmed, he said, adding that Israel would have preferred to solve this diplomatically, but Hamas has left no choice.
"This morning I convened the cabinet ministers and we decided that Israel would accept the cease-fire. I said that if Islamic Jihad and Hamas continue to fire on Israeli cities, I would instruct the IDF to act forcefully against them, and that is how we operated this afternoon. The air force bombed several targets across the Gaza Strip, and these strikes will continue. Hamas will pay the price for its decision to continue this campaign."
"Israel will harm anyone who tries to strike the citizen of Israel," he said. "When there is no cease-fire, out response is fire. The political front, the home front and the operational front are working together simultaneously It would have been preferable to solve this diplomatically, and that is what we tried to do, but Hamas has left us no chance but to expand the operation against it. This is how we will operate until we reach our goal, the restoration of quiet through a significant blow to terror."

5:07 P.M. Meretz head Zahava Galon calls on Netanyahu to fire Foreign Minister Lieberman due to the statements he made earlier in the afternoon (see below)regarding a take-over of the Gaza Strip. Galon said Lieberman's statement, which  "counters the security cabinet's decision is a violation of the legislative principle of shared governmental responsibility."
"Lieberman, the serial pyromaniac, is trying to reignite the fire of war and crush any chance of exhausting the possibility of a cease-fire," said Galon, who added that even worse than that, is the fact that the foreign minister, of all people, is sabotaging the diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a calm, and making Israel look like a warmonger.

5:00 P.M. 14 rockets fired at Eshkol Regional Council in last 40 minutes (Haaretz)
4:15 P.M. Operation Protective Edge must end with the IDF "controlling all of the Gaza Strip," says Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, urging a stop to the "never-ending hesitation and asking of questions."
"Israel must go all the way," he added, speaking at a press conference. "A cease-fire is a tacit agreement that Hamas continue to build up its power."
"All the diplomatic formulations are, in this case, hurtful A full takeover of the Gaza Strip is Israel's only course forward," said Lieberman, calling any cease-fire "nothing but a preparation for the next round" of fighting. "It is clear that Hamas will use any cease-fire to make more rockets and smuggle in more explosives."
The global pressures pushing for an Israeli return to its '67 borders are misguided, says Lieberman, and display the world's callous lack of concern for Israelis' security. The Foreign Minister cites Hamas' Gaza Strip rocket-fire as evidence that Israel's pullout from the Gaza Strip in 2005 was a mistake. "We have to tell the world - you pressured us into [the disengagement], this is what your believes led to, and just because of that, you need to give us the backing now to go all the way." (Haaretz)
3:25 P.M. The GOC Southern Command believes that despite the fact that previous operations also saw continued rocket fire after the cease-fire agreement kicked in, this time the fire is not tapering off and indicates that Hamas wishes to present an additional military achievement.
Maj. Gen. Sami Turgeman says that "in light of the continuing Hamas fire, we are now acting against it with force. Hamas initiated this campaign, and brought upon itself considerable damage. We chose not to put our full capabilities into action, and we have additional plans, and if we will need to, we will act expediently to conclude this operation." (Gili Cohen)
3:21 P.M. Reports in Gaza indicate most of the Israeli strikes were launched in open areas in the Khan Yunis and the Bureij refugee camps. The IDF says that between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. local time, more than 50 rockets and mortar shells were fired toward Israel. (Jack Khoury and Gili Cohen)

1:51 P.M. Justice Minister Tzipi Livni: "Israel is giving Hamas an opportunity to also accept the Egyptian proposal, to stop firing and to stop a painful Israeli response that it will suffer if it continues to fire rockets.

Hamas' political chief Khaled Meshal or his deputy Ismail Haniyeh is expected to release an official statement later Tuesday. The statement depends on how the talks between Hamas' leadership and Egypt progress in the coming hours. 
Earlier Tuesday, sources in Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that Israel's acceptance of the cease-fire agreement is an empty gesture, since Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip are continuing. Senior members of the two organizations downplayed the significance of the Egyptian initiative, and the possibility that a cease-fire would meet their demands. These demands include lifting the siege on Gaza, ending the military activity in the West Bank, the release of all those rearrested after being released in the Shalit prisoner exchange, and the improvement of the conditions of the Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.(Jack Khoury)

9:40 A.M. A senior Israeli official said following the security cabinet's decision to accept the cease-fire offer that if Hamas continues to fire rockets after the cease-fire, "Israel will respond forcefully." The official said that Israel's acceptance of the Egyptian offer gives Israel international legitimization in case Hamas does not stop the rocket fire.
"The bottom line is that Hamas did not accomplish what it wanted," the senior official said. "They suffered a serious blow, they did not manage to harm the Israeli home front, and did not succeed in carrying out strategic attacks since they were all intercepted. Also, Hamas did not manage to secure the support of the Arab world or to bring the West Bank into this round of violence." (Barak Ravid)

Gilad's statement and other statements made by other persons from the Israeli security establishment constitute an attempt to market the cease-fire agreement as an Israeli achievement and present Operation Protective Edge as a success. That being said, the announcement by Hamas' military wing that it rejects the agreement still raises doubts regarding the Egyptian proposal's chances of success. (Amos Harel)
9:00 A.M. Israel's security cabinet decides to accept Egyptian cease-fire proposal, which will go into effect at 9 A.M. and will give both sides 12 hours to halt attacks.

The number of rockets fired from Gaza toward Israel has also decreased. Two rocket impact sites were identified in the Eshkol Regional Council, and another three in the Eilat area. Currently, who fired the rockets at Eilat and whether they were fired from Sinai or the Gaza Strip is unknown.
As regards to the possibility that a cease-fire will take effect over the next few hours, the senior officer said, "The security establishment is waiting for the decision of the government, but is preparing for more fighting. There isn't a feeling of preparing for the end. The system is alert also as regards to defense [of the border], as well as to threats from within." (Gili Cohen)
5:04 A.M. U.S. President Barack Obama welcomes Egypt's cease-fire initiative, which he hopes "can restore a calm that we've been seeking. More broadly, the situation in Gaza reminds us that the status quo is unsustainable."
