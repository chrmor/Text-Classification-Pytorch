U.N. Security Council to meet over sanctions against N. Korea's nuke test
SEOUL, March 5 (Yonhap) -- The U.N. Security Council is set to hold a meeting on Tuesday (New York time) to discuss sanctions on North Korea for last month's nuclear test after Washington and Beijing tentatively agreed on a draft resolution, a senior Seoul diplomat said.   "The Security Council will hold a meeting at 11:00 a.m. in New York on Tuesday over North Korea's nuclear test," the diplomat said on the condition of anonymity.   "The meeting was called after the U.S. and Beijing reached a tentative agreement on a draft resolution against North Korea," the diplomat said.   The diplomat said he did not know details of the draft resolution nor what kind of sanctions were included in it.   North Korea's Feb. 12 nuclear test, its third since 2006, raised the prospect that Pyongyang might be a step closer to a workable long-range nuclear missile.   Seoul and Washington have been seeking to convince the U.N.'s most powerful body to adopt a resolution against Pyongyang that would include Articles 41 and 42 of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allow all U.N. members to enforce sanctions by military means.   If passed, the resolution will theoretically enable Navy ships to intercept and board North Korean vessels suspected of carrying illicit weapons or nuclear and missile components.   South Korean diplomats have admitted that China, the North's last-remaining ally and one of the veto-wielding council members, has expressed opposition to including Chapter 7 in the new resolution.   kdh@yna.co.kr (END)
