Gunman Goes on Fatal Rampage in Kazakhstan
MOSCOW — An attacker described by officials as a jihadist went on a shooting rampage in southern Kazakhstan on Saturday, killing at least seven people and blowing himself up, Kazakh authorities said.
The violence was the deadliest in a recent spate of small-scale attacks in Kazakhstan, a mostly Muslim former Soviet republic in Central Asia where such bloodshed used to be rare.
Last week, prosecutors blamed what they said was a recently formed militant group called Jund al-Khilafah for an apparently botched attack in the city of Atyrau that killed only the bomber. Two separate bombings in May also left only the attackers dead. Several police officers have been killed this year in shootouts with people suspected of being militants.
In Saturday’s attack, which occurred in Taraz, a man identified by investigators as M. K. Kariyev first killed two members of the Kazakh security service, a statement on the prosecutor general’s Web site said. The attacker raided a weapons store around 11:30 a.m., killing a guard and a customer, before making off with two semiautomatic rifles and ammunition, the statement said.
The suspect then killed two police officers who were pursuing him and took their weapons, including an assault rifle. He commandeered a car, and then went home and picked up a grenade launcher before attacking the regional headquarters of the National Security Committee. He was quickly surrounded by the police and wounded, evidently in a shootout.
