Istanbul airport attack: 42 killed; flights resume
Istanbul (CNN)With flags across Turkey at half-staff and the nation observing a day of mourning, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proclaimed the terror attack on Istanbul's airport "will not divide or split our country."
Erdogan promised the government will "not let down our people." He said by killing dozens of civilians, including women and children, the terrorists were not true Muslims.
"This is not Islamic. Taking one person's life means going straight to hell," he said Wednesday from the capital of Ankara, adding, "No terrorist organization will come between what we are."
Erdogan's televised comments came a day after he said in a written statement that an attack during the final days of the holy month of Ramadan show the attackers had no regard for faith or values.
No terror group has taken responsibility for the attack, in which three men arrived by taxi at the international terminal and launched their horror armed with rifles and suicide bomb vests.
"I think what they do is they carry out these attacks to gain the benefits from it in terms of sending a signal to our Turkish partners," he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, "(and at) the same time not wanting to potentially maybe alienate some of those individuals inside of Turkey that they may still be trying to gain the support of."
"I find this totally astonishing," said Professor Larry Kobilinsky of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "I've never seen such a massive crime scene looked at for five hours. It's just impossible. You're going to compromise, you're going to contaminate evidence. ... They should not have turned this open to the public."
"I was in the airport this morning looking for my lost luggage," he said. "They were sweeping up debris, and someone had hung up a big Turkish flag, pretty much right at the spot where (a) bomb had gone off -- sort of an act of defiance, which was quite moving."
"There was a lot of blood," she said. "There was so much glass on the floor, they were scuffing it aside so we didn't slip."
