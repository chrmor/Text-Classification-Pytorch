The Putin slur heard round the world delights Ukrainians, angers Russians
Kiev, Ukraine: Ukrainians have called Vladimir Putin many bad names, among them a Nazi, a dictator and just plain evil. But nothing has caused a firestorm quite like a Ukrainian diplomat's use of a schoolyard epithet to describe the Russian president during an unscripted moment on Saturday night.
Russian lawmakers called on Sunday for the dismissal of Ukraine's interim foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, after he tagged Putin with the swear word. Deshchytsia tossed out the insult breezily as he sought to calm protesters and halt an attack on the Russian Embassy in Kiev.
He had waded into a near-riot as hundreds of people vented their rage at the loss of 49 Ukrainian service members earlier on Saturday. Pro-Russian separatists, armed with weapons that many believe were supplied by Russia, shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane as it approached the airport in the eastern city of Luhansk, killing all aboard.
Every window in the three-story Russian Embassy was broken as protesters threw eggs, bricks, paintballs and car parts ripped off diplomatic vehicles.
