U.S. nonfarm payrolls fall by 54,000 in August
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. economy shed 54,000 nonfarm jobs in August, the Labor Department reported Friday, a much slower decline than economists anticipated as the health-care and temporary-staffing industries led a 67,000 expansion in private-sector employment.
Though the employment report broadly painted a picture of sputtering economic growth, the payrolls decline in August wasn't as steep as the 105,000 payroll subtraction expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch and eroded market fears about a double-dip recession.
"In short, hardly great news but could have been much worse," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. Read roundup of reactions.
Adding to the sense that the report was not as bad as feared, the payrolls count in June and July was revised higher by a cumulative 123,000. Payrolls fell a revised 175,000 in June and by 54,000 in July.
The stock market jumped on the report, though gains were tapered after the release of services sector data. Recently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 73 points DJIA, +0.41% to 10,393. See Market Snapshot.
The unemployment rate ticked higher to 9.6% in August from 9.5% in the previous month. Economists had expected the increase.
Hiring excluding the census and other government weakened to 67,000 in August from an upwardly revised 107,000 increase in July.
The private payrolls growth came in stronger than the 30,000 increase expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch. See MarketWatch calendar of key indicators with forecasts.
There were 121,000 government jobs lost, including 114,000 temporary Census workers, leaving 82,000 still on the payroll.
The average workweek was unchanged at 34.2 hours.
Average hourly earnings in August rose 0.2% to $19.08. Economists had been expecting a 0.1% gain. Earnings are up 1.7% in the past year.
Economists at Barclays Capital said the better-than-expected report would keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines at their next meeting on Sept. 21.
Some economists had predicted the Fed would launch a new quantitative easing program in order to try to stimulate the economy.
Health-care employment was strong in August, rising by 28,000.
Manufacturing employment fell by 27,000 in August after gaining 34,000 in July. Most of the decline was in the automotive sector, which over two months saw broadly flat employment due to General Motors keeping its plants running over the summer.
Construction employment rose 19,000 in August as 10,000 workers who had been on strike returned to work.
Temporary help agencies added 17,000 jobs in August. Shares of staffing firms including Manpower Inc. MAN, -0.75% and Monster Worldwide MWW rose in the wake of the report.
Harry Griendling, chief executive of DoubleStar Inc., a recruitment firm, said in an interview that the labor market is much more robust this year than in 2009.
However, the improvement itself remains fragile because businesses are not yet convinced that activity will pick up to a pace to justify bringing on new workers, he said.
In addition, workers without college degrees are encountering a very hostile environment for finding employment, Griendling said.
