At least 100 Boko Haram militants killed by Cameroon army
Cameroon’s army, backed by a regional taskforce, has killed at least 100 members of the militant Islamist Boko Haram group and freed 900 people it had held hostage, the west African country’s defence ministry has said.
Cameroon is part of an 8,700-strong regional group, also comprising troops from Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin, that aims to destroy Boko Haram, which, though based mainly in Nigeria, has become a major threat to wider regional security.
An army spokesman, Col Didier Badjeck, said on Wednesday that troops had conducted a sweep operation between 26-28 November along Cameroon’s long border with its western neighbour, Nigeria. Both Badjeck and the defence ministry, which gave a brief statement on state television, cited the same figures of militant deaths and the number of people freed.
Other military sources in Cameroon confirmed that a military operation had taken place, although one expressed surprise at its scale.
It was not immediately clear where the clashes with the militants had taken place or where Boko Haram’s captives had been held. It was also not known whether those freed included any of the 276 schoolgirls seized by the militants in their dormitories in Chibok, Nigeria last year.
Cameroon has suffered regular cross-border attacks in its far north in recent weeks, including twin suicide blasts overnight that killed at least three people. Suicide bombings, often carried out by young women recruited by the militant group in Nigeria, have become almost daily occurrences in the region.
