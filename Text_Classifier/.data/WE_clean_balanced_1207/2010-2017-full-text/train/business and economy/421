Crude, Gasoline, Heating Oil Drop on IEA Release: Oil Products
Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil tumbled in New York after the International Energy Agency said its members would release crude from strategic reserves. Ethanol also declined.
The agency announced the release of 2 million barrels a day for 30 days beginning next week to help make up for a Libyan supply disruption. Half the amount will come from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the IEA and the U.S. Energy Department.
Crude oil for August delivery fell $4.39, or 4.6 percent, to $91.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, below the 2010 year-end price of $91.38. Futures have risen 19 percent in the past year. It was the lowest settlement price for the front-month contract in four months.
“The big driver is the IEA number,” said Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “There’s been a constant string of negative news about the economy and a lack of direction from Washington, which makes for a very volatile market.”
Gasoline for July delivery dropped 13.57 cents, or 4.6 percent, to settle at $2.8376 a gallon on the Nymex. Gasoline has declined 9.9 percent in June and increased 36 percent in the past year.
Regular retail gasoline declined 1.4 cents to $3.612 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That was the lowest price since March 30.
Heating oil for July delivery slid 17.32 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $2.7817 a gallon. Heating oil has declined 9 percent this month and gained 34 percent in the past year.
Denatured ethanol for July delivery declined 1.1 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $2.647 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Ethanol has increased 69 percent in the past year.
