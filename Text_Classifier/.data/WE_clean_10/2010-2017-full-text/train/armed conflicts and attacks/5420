Deadly suicide attack hits Somali town
Suicide bombers have attacked a restaurant in the Somali town of Baidoa, killing at least 10 people and wounding many, police officers say.
Friday's dual attack comes only days after Somalia elected a new leader, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, the former speaker of parliament.
"First a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of the restaurant, and then a suicide car bomb followed when people converged to help," Captain Nur Osman, a police officer, told Reuters news agency by telephone.
Witnesses said the bodies of the victims were scattered around the blast site.
The armed group al-Shabab is responsible for a majority of suicide attacks in the country.
