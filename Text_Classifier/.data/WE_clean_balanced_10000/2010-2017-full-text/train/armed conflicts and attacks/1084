8 killed as Indian, Pakistani troops trade fire and blame in troubled Kashmir
Indian and Pakistani troops are continuing to trade heavy gunfire and mortar rounds along the highly militarized line of control dividing the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir between the two archrivals.
Indian army spokesman Lt. Col. Manish Mehta says Pakistani troops were fired on Indian positions for a seventh day Sunday in Balakote and Poonch sectors.
Indian police officer Danish Rana says six civilians have died in the Pakistani shelling over the weekend. At least 17 others were wounded.
Pakistan's army says that two civilians have been killed and two others wounded in the fighting.
Each side blames the other for starting the violence.
Despite a 2003 ceasefire the two neighbors regularly trade fire, the latest coming as India celebrated Independence Day on Saturday. Pakistan observed it a day earlier.
