The world's best sprinter Black Caviar has equalled the great Phar Lap's 14-run unbeaten streak with a painless victory in the Schillaci Stakes (1,000m) in Melbourne.
Thousands flocked to Caulfield and filled every vantage point to watch Black Caviar ($1.07) win the $200,000 Group Two event by 4-1/4 lengths from Karuta Queen ($13) and Stirling Grove ($31).
Trainer Peter Moody breathed a huge sigh of relief to see his people's champion come back and win the way champions do, and declared Black Caviar's best is still to come.
"It's a relief to have her back in great shape and doing what she loves and putting on a great show for the crowd," Moody said.
"She's a fully developed mare now and I think this will be her best campaign."
Moody, who has so far resisted the temptation of the rich sprints in the northern hemisphere, also gave a hint the world will get to see Australia's black flash next year.
"Maybe the world's her oyster this racing season," he said.
Connections are eager to stretch Black Caviar out to 1,400 to 1,600 metres this season, and ultimately a trip to Royal Ascot next June is on the agenda.
In the meantime, Moody says Black Caviar will follow the same path as she did last spring.
She will look to extend her picket fence and win her 15th race in the Moir Stakes (1,200m) in a fortnight before tackling the $1 million Patinack Classic on November 5.
Jockey Luke Nolen agrees with Moody's assessment that the mare is as good as ever and is glad she could win again for her adoring fans.
"It's been remarkable the attention she gets," Nolen said.
"We're probably in that media age where everyone in the industry is more accessible, even the equines as well.
"It's great that she brings fresh faces to the races and generates great headlines for racing."
