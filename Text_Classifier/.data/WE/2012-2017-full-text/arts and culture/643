Davy Jones of the Monkees dies
Monkees singer Davy Jones died Wednesday after suffering a heart attack. He was 66. Martin County, Florida’s Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the news, first reported by TMZ. Authorities say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.
Jones joined the Monkees in 1965 along with Michael Nesmith, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork. Their hits include “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “Daydream Believer,” and “Last Train to Clarksville.”
Jones left the band in 1970, according to their website. He went on to land a solo hit, “Rainy Jane,” the next year, and also made several TV appearances, including a late 1971 episode ofThe Brady Bunch.
Jones reunited with Tork and Dolenz for a tour in the mid-1980s, and in 1987 they released a new record, Pool It. 
They reunited once more in the mid-1990s — this time, with Nesmith also on board — and released their 11th record,Justus, and again in 2010 for a reunion tour in 2011 that turned out to be their last.
Jones had just fronted a solo set at New York’s BB King Blues Club and Grill on Feb. 18, video below.
