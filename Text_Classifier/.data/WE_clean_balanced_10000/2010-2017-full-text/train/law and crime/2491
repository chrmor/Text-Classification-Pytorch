Dundee United footballers in sex assault inquiry
Two Dundee United footballers have been questioned by police in connection with an alleged serious sexual assault.
BBC Scotland understands the players are David Goodwillie and David Robertson.
It is understood the men were questioned by officers last week, in connection with an incident at a New Year house party in West Lothian.
Neither man has been charged but both are continuing to help police with their inquiries.
Lothian and Borders Police confirmed that they were investigating a complaint brought by a 24-year-old woman following an allegation of serious sexual assault in Armadale on 2 January.
