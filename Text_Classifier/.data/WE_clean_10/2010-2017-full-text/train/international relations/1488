Iran Digging Mass Graves For US Troops
A former commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard says Iran has dug mass graves to bury U.S. soldiers in preparation for an American attack on the country. In an interview with the Associated Press, former Iranian General Hossein Kan'ani Moghadam said the graves have been dug in Iran's southwestern Khuzestan province. Moghadam said this is the same area where Iran buried Iraqi soldiers killed during the 1980 to 1988 war with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's regime. He said the mass graves used for burying Iraqi soldiers have now been prepared for U.S. soldiers. Video footage shows a large number of empty, freshly dug graves in a desert region. The digging of graves was first reported earlier this week by Iran's semiofficial FARS news agency. Moghadam also said if U.S. forces attack, Iran will have no choice but to strike American bases in other countries in the region. The war of words between the United States and Iran has intensified since the U.N. Security Council imposed a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June for its refusal to stop uranium enrichment. The U.S. and other nations believe Iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop nuclear weapons -- a charge Iran denies.
