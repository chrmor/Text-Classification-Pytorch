Campaigning ends ahead of Iran's presidential vote
Supporters of the two leading candidates in Iran’s presidential election took to the streets as official campaigning came to an end.
But despite festive scenes ahead of Friday’s vote, there has been tension between the moderate and reformist forces and hardline fundamentalists with fiery exchanges.
It has turned into a tight race between incumbent President Hassan Rouhani, described as a pragmatist, and the hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi.
One young woman in Tehran told Euronews: “We’ve gone forward with hope and we think moderation is the best thing.
“We want it to happen. We want our candidate to win. We want to have hope.”
One young man said: “I’m holding both photos (Rouhani and Raisi) to say we’re all Iranians, that unity matters and no matter who we choose the important thing is to vote and choose by logic.”
As the campaigning came to an end there was an intervention by the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday.
He slammed the heated tone of the election campaign, describing it as “unworthy”.
Some observers read that as a thinly veiled attack on President Rouhani and his attacks on Raisi.
