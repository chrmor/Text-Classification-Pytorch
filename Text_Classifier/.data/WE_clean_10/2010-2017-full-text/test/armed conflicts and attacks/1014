Bangladeshis strike over missing politician
A nationwide strike triggered by the disappearance of Ilyas Ali, an opposition politician, has brought much of Bangladesh to a standstill.
At least two people were reportedly killed, hundreds were injured and scores were detained after clashes between police and protesters on Monday, who are demanding government action over the disappearance of Ali, a former student leader and member of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
Sheikh Hasina Wajed, prime minister, has ordered an investigation into the matter, with the BNP and Ali’s family alleging he was abducted by security forces. Police deny any involvement.
Human rights groups have accused Bangladesh's security forces of being behind several disappearances of activists and opposition leaders.
