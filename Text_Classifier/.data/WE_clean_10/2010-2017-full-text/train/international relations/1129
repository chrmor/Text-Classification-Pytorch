Ukraine rebuffed over jailed leader
UKRAINE is facing growing isolation as five presidents and the EU Commission cancelled visits over suspected maltreatment of Yulia Tymoshenko, its jailed former prime minister.
Jose Manuel Barroso, the EU Commission's president, and Viviane Reding, its justice commissioner, said they would boycott the Euro 2012 soccer tournament.
Earlier, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor and an avid football fan, said she may snub the tournament over the suspected maltreatment of Tymoshenko, who is reported to be on hunger strike in prison.
The presidents of Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy and Slovenia told Kiev of plans to miss the Yalta meeting of central and eastern European presidents on May 11 and 12.
European leaders and officials have previously complained that Tymoshenko's jailing last year was unfair, but disapproval grew when pictures emerged of her showing bruises, which she claimed were the result of a beating when she was forcibly taken from prison to visit a clinic on April 20. In October she was sentenced to seven years for abuse of office, in what her supporters claimed was a show trial orchestrated by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Tymoshenko's daughter, Eugenia, said the rebuffs were ''the last diplomatic warning to the regime''.
A spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry said: ''I would not like to think that the statesmen of Germany are capable of reanimating the methods of the Cold War and trying to make sport a hostage to politics.''
