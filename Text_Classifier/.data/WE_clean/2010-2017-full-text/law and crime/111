Leaking Burmese officials to be executed
Two officials have been sentenced to death by a court in Burma for leaking information, official sources say, in a case reportedly involving secret ties between the ruling junta and North Korea.
The men were arrested after details and photos about a trip to Pyongyang by the Burma regime's third-in-command, General Shwe Mann, were leaked to exiled media last year, the website of Thailand-based magazine Irrawaddy reported.
"Two officials got the death sentence and another one was jailed for 15 years for leaking information. They were sentenced at the special court in Insein Prison on Thursday," one source said.
The two men sentenced to death were Win Naing Kyaw and Thura Kyaw while the jailed man was Pyan Sein, the sources said, without giving further details of the case.
Win Naing Kyaw is a former military officer and Thura Kyaw and Pyan Sein worked at the ministry of foreign affairs, Irrawaddy said.
The trip by Shwe Mann, who is also the joint chief of staff of the Burmese armed forces, involved procuring military arms and discussing tunnel-building and other matters, Irrawaddy reported.
