Egyptians amass for biggest day of anger yet
Egyptians amassed Tuesday for the biggest day of anger yet in their unrelenting campaign to oust President Hosni Mubarak, on the eighth day of a revolt that has already killed over 100.
Thousands of protesters flooded Cairo's protest epicentre at Tahrir Square from early morning with "marches of a million" against Mubarak's creaking regime planned in the Egyptian capital and Alexandria.
Many spent the night on the square, sleeping in dozens of tents or on the grass, encircled by troops and tanks.
By midday (1000 GMT) the crowd had swelled and the huge square was crammed with banner-waving protesters, as more streamed on foot towards the site from across Cairo for the march.
The army, which has said it will not shoot at protesters, checked IDs and searched protesters before letting them into the square. Civilians then checked IDs again, looking for plain-clothes police who they say are being deployed as agents provocateurs.
"I will stay here till I die," said a defiant Osama Allam, wearing jacket, tie and jeans.
