8Â killed in building collapse in NW China
XI'AN -- A four-story residential building under construction collapsed Saturday morning in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, killing eight workers and injuring three, local authorities said Sunday.
The accident occurred at around 10:50 a.m. in Chang'an District of Xi'an City, capital of Shaanxi. Rescue work involving more than 300 fire fighters, police and medical workers finished at around 3:30 a.m. Sunday.
The three injured, including the building's owner Cao Minchang, were sent to hospital for treatment, said Mi Weixin, deputy secretary general of the Xi'an municipal government.
A Xinhua reporter saw at the scene that the construction of the residential building was almost completed. Neighbor residents have been evacuated for safety concern.
Initial investigation showed that disqualified construction material might be the cause of the accident, said Huang Hongwu, a street community official with Chang'an District.
The police are looking for two contractors who had fled after the accident.
