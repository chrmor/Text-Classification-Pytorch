Sweden on 'high' terror alert for the first time
The threat level has been raised to "high" (or "four"), the second most serious out of five possible categories. Only a level-five threat ("very high") is higher.
According to Säpo's definition, this means that "the probability that players have the intent and ability to carry out attacks is high".
Säpo's Director General Anders Thornberg called a press conference on Wednesday evening, telling reporters that one person was suspected of planning terror activities in Sweden and had been arrested in absentia.
Interior Minister Anders Ygeman later said that authorities were checking out reports that the suspect could be in Sweden, although he said it remained unclear at this stage.
"We're at an intensive operative stage and are working to analyse the information," he told reporters.
Thornberg added that the evidence gathered about a potential threat to Sweden was not directly linked to the terror attacks in Paris on Friday.
Mats Sandberg, head of Sweden's National Centre for Terrorist Threat Assessment (NCT) told reporters: "Isis views Sweden as a legitimate target of violent Islamism. We're not a prioritized target, but a legitimate one."
According to Sandberg, there are a "number of people" in Sweden that are considered to have the ability and the intention to carry out terror attacks in the Nordic nation and authorities are trying to establish how likely it is that their ideas could be put into action.
At a later press conference, Sweden's Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said that a series of measures already planned to increase security across the country would be put to parliament before Christmas, including making it more difficult for people to use fake passports when crossing the border into Sweden.
He said he hoped that there would be cross-party cooperation and that some of the policies could be fast-tracked.
Describing the shifting terror threat level, he added: "It is of course serious. It is the first time we're raising the level to four."
