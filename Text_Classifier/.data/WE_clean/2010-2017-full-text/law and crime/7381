Ivory Coast sets up body to probe abuses
Ivorian authorities have said they are setting up a national commission to investigate crimes committed during recent months of violence.
The body aims to "shed light on all the human rights violations committed during the post-electoral crisis," a government spokesperson said.
President Alassane Ouattara has promised abuses will not go unpunished.
Both Mr Ouattara's forces and those loyal to former President Laurent Gbagbo are accused of atrocities.
Mr Ouattara was sworn in in April following months of conflict triggered by disputed presidential polls.
The decision to create an investigative body was made by at a cabinet meeting, according to a statement from spokesman Bruno Nabagne Kone.
On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch claimed that the Abidjan authorities were only investigating abuses committed by Mr Gbagbo's fighters.
The violence in Ivory Coast was triggered by the refusal of Mr Gbagbo to cede power and accept Mr Ouattara's victory in presidential elections last November.
At least 3,000 people were killed in the conflict.
