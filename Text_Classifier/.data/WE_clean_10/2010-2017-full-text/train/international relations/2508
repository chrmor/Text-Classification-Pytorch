Ukraine court finds Bolsheviks guilty of Holodomor genocide
A court in Kiev found Bolshevik leaders guilty of genocide against Ukrainians during the 1932-1933 Holodomor famine, the country's National Security Service said on Wednesday.
A court in Kiev found Bolshevik leaders guilty of genocide against Ukrainians during the 1932-1933 Holodomor famine, the country's National Security Service said on Wednesday.
The court found dictator Joseph Stalin and several other senior Soviet officials guilty, but dropped criminal proceedings "over the suspects' deaths."
The court examined the case filed by the security service and upheld "investigators' conclusions that the leaders of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime organized ... the genocide against the Ukrainian ethnic group intentionally creating conditions aimed at its partial physical elimination," the service said in a statement.
Ukraine, which says that more than 3.9 million people died during the famine, has been seeking international recognition of the famine as an act of genocide.
A number of Ukrainian nationalist parties say that Russia, as the legal successor of the Soviet Union, should bear responsibility for the famine.
Russia says the famine cannot be considered an act that targeted Ukrainians, as millions of people from different ethnic groups also lost their lives in vast territories across the Soviet Union.
Last year, the United Nations General Assembly refused to include a discussion of the famine on its official session agenda.
