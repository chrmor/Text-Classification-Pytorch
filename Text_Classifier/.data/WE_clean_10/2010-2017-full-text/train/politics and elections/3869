Belgian Minister Resigns Over Brussels Terror Attacks
Belgian Transport Minister Jacqueline Galant has resigned in the wake of the March 22 terrorist attacks that killed 32 people in Brussels.
Galant resigned on April 15 amid accusations her ministry had ignored EU criticism of security at Belgium's airports. Nineteen of the March 22 victims were killed at the Brussels airport.
The confidential EU reports were leaked to the press by the opposition Green Party on April 13. The most recent one, from 2015, said Belgian airports were "not compliant" with security standards and that several serious problems had been identified.
Galant told journalists on April 15 that "the orchestrated and theatrical chaos of the last 48 hours makes it impossible for me to continue."
She denied that she failed to take security seriously.
