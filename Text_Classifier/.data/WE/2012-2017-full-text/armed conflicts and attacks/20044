Two miltants killed in security raid in Cairo after exchange of fire
Two militants were killed and five others wounded Thursday when security forces raided a suspected militant hideout in Gesr El-Suez district, East Cairo.
Three policemen were injured and another militant was apprehended during the security operation, a security source told Al-Ahram Arabic website.
The clashes took place for 30 minutes at dawn, after militants opened fire on security forces from an area apartment building.
On Sunday, Egypt's interior ministry announced that it arrested five men suspected of carrying out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack on Gesr Al Suez road in Cairo Friday, hours after the explosion killed one civilian.
The Ministry of Interior has not yet released a statement on the details of the raid.
Attacks against security forces have become common in recent years but are mostly concentrated in North Sinai, where Egypt's army and police are battling an entrenched Islamist insurgency. Â
