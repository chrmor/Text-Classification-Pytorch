U.N. Chief Calls for New Inquiry Into 1961 Plane Crash That Killed Dag Hammarskjold
UNITED NATIONS — For more than 50 years, the death of Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold of the United Nations has been shrouded in mystery and a fair bit of conspiracy theory.
On Monday, the United Nations’ current secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, announced that the plane crash that killed Mr. Hammarskjold should be reinvestigated after a panel he appointed had uncovered enough new information to suggest that the plane, which went down in late 1961 in Africa, could have been the target of an aerial attack or some other interference.
Mr. Ban said the panel had put certain theories to rest, but had raised questions about others. He called for a new inquiry to “finally establish the facts.” In a cover letter attached to the panel’s report and released Monday, Mr. Ban called on governments to share information they might have about what happened the night of the crash. The panel was unable to persuade either the United States or Britain to make classified files available.
 Mr. Ban called it “our shared responsibility to pursue the full truth concerning the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjold and the others accompanying him.”
 Mr. Hammarskjold, a Swede, was killed with 15 others in the crash on the night of Sept. 17 to 18, 1961, in a forest in the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia, an area that is now part of Zambia. Mr. Hammarskjold was on his way to broker a truce in the mineral-rich Katanga Province of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr. Hammarskjold was awarded the 1961 Nobel Peace Prize after his death.
