Flood at China coal pit traps 28
A flood at a coal mine in south-western China has trapped 28 people, Chinese state media report.
A rescue operation is taking place at the Batian pit near Neijiang city in Sichuan province, Xinhua news agency said.
Thirteen of the 41 miners underground at the small, private mine managed to escape.
China's mines are the world's deadliest; more than 2,600 miners died in accidents in 2009.
"We still have hope of finding them alive," one provincial safety official told the Associated Press.
He said an estimated 141,000 cu ft (4,000 cu m) of water was in the pit and pumps for removing it were on the way.
