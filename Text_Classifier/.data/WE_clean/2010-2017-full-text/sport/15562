Basel up against Chelsea, Fenerbahçe face Benfica
Former European champions SL Benfica and Chelsea FC were kept apart in Friday's UEFA Europa League semi-final draw.
The draw was conducted at UEFA headquarters in Nyon by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and former Netherlands striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. Chelsea, last season's UEFA Champions League winners, were pitted against FC Basel 1893, in the last four of a UEFA competition for the first time. Murat Yakin's side have already seen off one London club this term, overcoming Tottenham Hotspur FC on penalties in their quarter-final. The Blues and Basel have never met before.
Benfica, meanwhile, are up against another team who are in uncharted territory, Fenerbahçe SK. The Turkish outfit will be looking for a measure of revenge against Benfica, having suffered a 7-1 aggregate defeat in the sides' sole previous encounter – in the 1975/76 European Champion Clubs' Cup first round. Benfica were 7-0 victors in Lisbon before a 1-0 loss in Istanbul.
While this is new ground for Basel and Fenerbahçe, Benfica are in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons. They fell to SC Braga on away goals in 2010/11. Chelsea, meanwhile, are bidding to become only the fourth team to win all three of UEFA's major club competitions. They lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1971 and 1998, plus last year's UEFA Champions League, and would emulate Juventus, AFC Ajax and FC Bayern München by completing the treble. Manager Rafael Benítez also landed the UEFA Cup with Valencia CF in 2004.
Final (15 May, Amsterdam ArenA) For administrative purposes, a draw was made to determine who will be the designated home team for the final. The winners of the Fenerbahçe v Benfica tie were selected.
