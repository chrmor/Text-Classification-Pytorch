If you were hoping for a quick return to action for the self-exiled Georges St-Pierre, you're going to be disappointed.
The former UFC welterweight champion today announced he suffered a torn ACL in training and will now undergo surgery to repair the injury.
INJURIES: Costs of being in the cage
St-Pierre posted this message on Facebook, where he revealed the injury happened just this past week, but that he's determined to return to full health:
"Just got confirmation that I tore my left knee ACL during training this weekâ€¦ Surgery in a few days and rehab starts right away. We all face challenges in our lives and I know only one way to take this one: Pain, hard work, no shortcuts and I will soon be back at 100%. Stay tuned and thanks for your amazing support, as always."
St-Pierre hasn't fought since November, when he scored a narrow split-decision win over Johny Hendricks. However, after the win, St-Pierre announced he wanted to relinquish the belt in favor of some time way from the sport.
Hendricks then defeated Robbie Lawler earlier this month at UFC 171 to become the UFC's undisputed welterweight champion.
Despite St-Pierre willingly handing over the belt, UFC President Dana White has remained confident the future UFC Hall of Famer will indeed fight again. When (or if) that will now take place remains to be seen.
St-Pierre is no stranger to ACL tears, as he blew out his left knee in 2011 and was forced to go under the knife. Recovery from that setback took approximately one full year.
