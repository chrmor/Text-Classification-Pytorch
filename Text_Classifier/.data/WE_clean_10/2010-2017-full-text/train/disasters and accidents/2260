Liverpool Street train delays caused by heat continue
Train delays between London Liverpool Street and most parts of the East will continue as repairs to overhead power lines are carried out, rail bosses say.
Speed restrictions were imposed on sections of line between London, Norwich, Ipswich and Colchester because hot weather affected power lines.
Many trains between Liverpool Street, Southend, Stansted, Cheshunt, Shenfield and Enfield were cancelled.
National Express East Anglia said the disruption would continue all evening.
National Express East Anglia said: "Due to high temperature on Monday 27 June, speed restrictions have been imposed due to the design of the overhead line equipment.
"This equipment is subject to major renewal which will prevent the need for speed restrictions in the long term."
A Network Rail spokeswoman said speeds were reduced on the London to Norwich Great Eastern line from 90mph to 80mph and were cut to 60mph "in the hottest part of the day".
There had also been damage to some overhead lines and these would be repaired during the night.
Overhead line problems at Hockley and Bethnal Green were hitting services to Southend Victoria, Norwich and Cambridge.
National Express East Anglia also said the delays and cancellations meant that some trains had to be relocated before normal services could be resumed.
