Investigators Find Air France Jet's Black Box
Investigators combing the wreckage of an Air France jetliner that crashed almost two years ago said Sunday they had located and retrieved the plane's data recorder from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean.
Since the Airbus A330 jetliner disappeared en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people onboard, their families and industry officials have wanted to learn what caused the crash.
