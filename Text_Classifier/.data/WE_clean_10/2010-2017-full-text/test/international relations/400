We know everything, Shell executive boasted
AUSTRALIA'S top-ranking executive at oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians' every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.
Ann Pickard, then Shell's top executive in Nigeria, told US diplomats in October 2009 that Shell knew ''everything that was being done in those ministries''.
She boasted the Nigerian government had ''forgotten'' about the extent of Shell's infiltration and were unaware of how much the company knew about its deliberations.
Earlier this year, Ms Pickard became Shell's top-ranking director in Australia. Forbes magazine last year named her in its list of the world's most powerful businesswomen.
The cache of secret dispatches from Washington's embassies in Africa also revealed that the Anglo-Dutch oil firm swapped intelligence with the US, in one case providing US diplomats with the names of Nigerian politicians it suspected of supporting militant activity.
Nigeria is Africa's leading oil producer, accounting for 8 per cent of US oil imports - and 70 per cent of its people live below the poverty line.
