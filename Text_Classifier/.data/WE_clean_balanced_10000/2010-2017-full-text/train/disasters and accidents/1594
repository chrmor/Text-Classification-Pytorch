Bus falls into ravine, at least 25 killed
At least 25Â people, including women and children, were killed and 20 others injured when a bus carrying guests for a wedding fell into a ravine in Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir on Sunday, police said.
The bus carrying over 50 passengers fell into a ravine when the driver failed to negotiate a sharp turn on a mountain route in the district of Sudhanoti -- some 150 kilometers (93 miles) from capital Islamabad, Hassan Qayyum, a city police chief told reporters.
The death toll, according to doctors, may rise as several injured were in critical condition.
The rescue operation was underway until the filing of this report as rescuers were facing difficulties in carrying out the operation due to lack of visibility and the mountainous terrain.
