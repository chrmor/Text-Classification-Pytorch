Is this 'total war'? Anonymous posts Trump's Social Security number, phone number
The hacker group Anonymous made headlines the other day by saying it was declaring "total war" on GOP front-runner Donald Trump. On Thursday, it started to make good on its promise ... sort of.
The group, known for cyber attacks on corporations and the government, posted information on Trump that can already be found pretty easily if you know how to Google things or look through public documents: his birth date and birthplace (Trump birthers, anyone?), the main address for the Trump Organization, his agent, his legal representation, and the names of his parents, wife and kids.
The two bits of info that aren't readily available: the Donald's (alleged) Social Security number and his cell phone number.
What should Trump do? Get a new cell phone number, as Sen. Lindsey Graham can attest to after Trump handed out *his* cell phone number last summer. (A new Social Security number is an entirely different matter.)
