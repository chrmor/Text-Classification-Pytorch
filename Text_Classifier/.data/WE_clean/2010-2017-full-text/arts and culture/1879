Gary Coleman death ruled an accident
Diff'rent Strokes actor Gary Coleman's death was an accident, US authorities have ruled.
Salt Lake City police chief Dennis Howard said an autopsy found the star died of natural causes after an accidental fall at his home in May.
Coleman died two days later in hospital when he was taken off life support after suffering a brain haemorrhage.
Howard said the state medical examiner's conclusions brought the police investigation to a close.
He added the findings matched the evidence police found at Coleman's Santaquin home.
Since the actor's death, there has been a legal dispute between his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend, who have both claimed control of his estate.
Ex-wife Shannan Price petitioned the Utah courts to recognise her common-law relationship with Coleman from the date of their divorce in 2008 until his death.
But the star's former girlfriend, Anna Gray, claimed a 2005 will awarded her the estate. Ms Price countered that a note, handwritten by Coleman days after their 2007 marriage, named her as his sole heir.
