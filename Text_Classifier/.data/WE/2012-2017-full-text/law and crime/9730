"By inviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month, ...the town is acknowledging the central place that religion and religious institutions hold in the lives of those present," said Justice . If some citizens hear prayers that "make them feel excluded and disrespected," they should ignore them, he said. "Adults often encounter speech they find disagreeable."
