Syrian Kurds capture town from ISIS in north: activists
The Kurdish YPG militia Monday captured a town from ISIS fighters in northern Syria after a month-long offensive against the ultra hardline militants in the area to cut their supply lines, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The YPG, backed by small Syrian rebel groups, has made significant gains against ISIS in Raqqa province, seizing Tal Abyad at the Turkish border on June 15 before advancing south and capturing the town of Ain Issa, 50 km (30 miles) north of the militants' Syria stronghold of Raqqa city.
