Nine Dead, Including Gunman, After Missouri Shooting Spree
A gunman killed seven people — four of whom are family members of the suspect — in a door-to-door shooting spree in Missouri on Thursday before killing himself, officials said Friday. The rampage may have been triggered by finding his mother dead of apparent natural causes, officials added.
Gunman Joseph Jesse Aldridge, 36, was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a car in a neighboring county after the killings in the rural community of Tyrone, a small town of about 50 people, authorities said.
Texas County coroner Tom Whittaker told NBC affiliate KSDKthat the body of a woman identified by authorities as Aldridge’s mother, 74-year-old Alice Aldridge, had been dead for 24 hours before she was found by authorities Thursday night, and she is thought to have died of natural causes.
Whittaker said the suspect’s discovery of the body may have sparked the killing spree, but investigators said a motive has not yet been determined. Texas County Sheriff’s deputies first learned of the rampage — which spanned six crime scenes in a three-mile radius in Tyrone — just after 10 p.m. local time after a juvenile female called 911 and said there were gunshots in her home.
