Monster Snowstorm Leaves At Least 19 Dead, Paralyzes East Coast
A killer snowstorm paralyzed the East Coast on Saturday, effectively shutting down New York City and the nation's capital, while dumping as much as 3 feet of snow in other areas.
At least 19 people died in the mammoth storm, which canceled thousands of flights throughout the weekend.
New York City recorded its second-largest snowfall since 1869, with Central Park receiving 26.8 inches by midnight â€” 0.1 inch shy of tying the record 26.9 inches set in 2006, the National Weather Service said.
Baltimore got a record 25.5 inches, breaking a daily record set in 1935, and a measurement of 22.3 inches of snow was taken in Washington, D.C. at midnight.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed all roads in New York City and Long Island at 2:30 p.m. Saturday as well as tunnels and bridges going to New Jersey. Above-ground sections of the subway and New York City buses stopped running.
The travel ban will be lifted at 7 a.m. Sunday, Cuomo said Saturday evening. "We have made very good progress in cleaning the roads," Cuomo said in a conference call with reporters.
While unusual, Cuomo said the shutdown was necessary because "the storm was fast and furious, and we believe that safety is paramount."
