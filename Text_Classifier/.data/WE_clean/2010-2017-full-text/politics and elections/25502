Musharraf Leaves Pakistan for Treatment After Travel Ban Lifted
Pakistan’s former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who faces trial in a series of cases including treason, left the country on Friday for medical treatment hours after the government took his name off a no-fly list.
“He will stay in Dubai for as long as a week, before moving on to either the U.S. or U.K. for treatment," Aasia Ishaque, a spokeswoman for the former president, said by phone. “He will return to Pakistan, much to the disappointment of his detractors.”
Musharraf, 72, may need surgery for worsening pain in the backbone and leg, Ishaque said, noting that he had to be injected with painkillers twice in the last 10 days. He has committed to face all pending legal cases and “promised to return in four to six weeks,” Dawn newspaper reported on Friday, citing Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government cleared Musharraf’s travel after the Supreme Court earlier this week lifted a 2013 ban that barred him from international trips. Musharraf had ruled from 1999 to 2008 after ousting Sharif in a coup, and had returned in 2013 after a short spell abroad.
He was subsequently charged in a series of cases, including treason for suspending the constitution and involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf denies the charges.
