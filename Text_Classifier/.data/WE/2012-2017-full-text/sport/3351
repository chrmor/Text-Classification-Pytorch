“Hot.Cool.Yours.” – Sochi 2014 slogan announced — RT Sport News
With 500 days left before the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the organizers have unveiled the Games’ official slogan: “Hot.Cool.Yours.”
­The slogan is a “universal solution” that “reflects Russia’s national character, the brand values of Sochi 2014, and also the progressive and innovative approach to organizing and hosting the Games,”the organizing committee said in a statement.
Its head Dmitry Chernyshenko says the slogan is aimed to bring more foreigners to Sochi and also make Russians proud.
“The Sochi 2014 slogan says it’s impossible not to take part, impossible not to watch, impossible not to get excited and it’s worth being proud because these are our Games,”he said, stressing that "hot" and "cool" are also references to Sochi's unique sun-and-snow climate.
The London 2012 Olympics featured the slogan "Inspire a Generation," while visitors in Vancouver were welcomed "With Glowing Hearts," a line from the national anthem.
As for celebrating 500 days until the start of the Games, around 12,000 Olympic volunteers in 17 cities are taking part in the festivities, which will culminate in assembling giant jigsaw puzzles depicting the official pictograms of the 22 Winter Olympic disciplines.
