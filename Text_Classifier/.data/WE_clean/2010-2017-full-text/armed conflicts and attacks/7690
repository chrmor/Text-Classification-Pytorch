UN extends DR Congo peace mission
After 12 years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO has been extended for another year.
The UN wants FARDC - the DRC's military - to step up and help.
But without the UN presence, residents feel they are easy targets for armed rebels who rob, rape and harrass people along the roads.
A war is still raging in the country with rebel groups battling over mines worth millions of dollars.
Over five million people have already been killed and thousands have been displaced.
