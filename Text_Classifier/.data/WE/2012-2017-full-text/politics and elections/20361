Thousands Protest Brazilian President Ahead of Vote on Public-Spending Cap
BRASÍLIA—Thousands of demonstrators on Tuesday evening staged one of the strongest protests against Brazilian President Michel Temer and his fiscal-austerity agenda, turning over cars and trying to break into the country’s Senate as police fired tear gas and what appeared to be rubber bullets.
The demonstrators were mostly from leftist groups who supported former President Dilma Rousseff, who was ousted in August accused of budget crimes.
