Taiwan quake toll rises to 59; 76 missing
TAIWAN'S Ministry of Interior says the death toll from the recent earthquake has risen to 59, with 76 people still missing and presumed trapped under the rubble of a collapsed residential building.
THE 16-story Weiguan Golden Dragon complex was the only building to collapse during Saturday's magnitude-6.4 earthquake, which otherwise caused limited damage in the southern city of Tainan.
