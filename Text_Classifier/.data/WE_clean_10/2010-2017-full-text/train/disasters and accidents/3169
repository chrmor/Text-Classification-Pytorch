Japan jolted by strong 6.8 quake
Disaster-weary Japan has been rattled by another strong quake, which measured at a preliminary magnitude of 6.8, triggered a tsunami warning and sent people diving for cover.
The Friday quake struck the Pacific seabed not far from the epicentre of the March 11 quake-tsunami disaster that killed more than 20,000 people and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 25 years ago.
Sirens again wailed along the devastated northeast coast, where people have been terrified by hundreds of aftershocks over the past five months, and the quake also caused buildings to sway across Tokyo.
The tremor struck at a depth of 20 kilometres off the Pacific coast, 80 kilometres southeast of Miyagi prefecture, at 2.36pm local time (15:36 AEST), according to a preliminary report from the meteorological agency.
The agency issued a 50-centimetre tsunami warning but called it off after only very small waves were seen lapping at the coast.
The operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), quickly said there were no reports of fresh damage or abnormalities after the latest quake.
