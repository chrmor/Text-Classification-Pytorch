Video Shows U.S. Soldiers Surrendering Before Fatal Shooting in Jordan
James R. Moriarty, a Houston lawyer and the father of Sergeant Moriarty, said Monday that he was briefed by the F.B.I., which told him the video was released by Jordanian authorities to defuse protests and keep Sergeant Tawayha from being extolled as a martyr.
“Jordan tried to minimize this, saying it was the Americans’ fault, and now it has come back to haunt them,” Mr. Moriarty said.
It remained unclear whether the video would appease those in Jordan who felt that Sergeant Tawayha had been wrongfully convicted.
Initially, both the American and Jordanian governments concealed details about the shooting, with American officials not mentioning that the three men killed had been training Syrian rebels as part of a covert program run by the C.I.A.
The case has baffled investigators from both countries, who have not found any indications that Sergeant Tawayha had extremist views that would have led him to kill Americans.
The video provides no insight into why the shooting happened. It has no sound, making it unclear what anyone involved was saying, and the camera angle is limited, showing only two of the cars in the four-car convoy after the shooting begins.
A Jordanian official said on Monday night that the video could not be released earlier because Sergeant Tawayha’s trial was in progress.
