At 11.13pm, another aftershock was felt at the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, following the 6.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked parts of Sabah this morning at 7.15.
The tremor felt stronger than the aftershock that hit earlier at about 9.10pm.
To date, at least two bodies have been brought down by rescue teams. One has been identified as the Amazing Borneo mountain guide Rubbi Sapinggi while the other is a 12-year-old student from Singapore, Rachel Ho Yan Shiuan.
The bodies have been sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kota Kinabalu for a post-mortem.
State Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun tweeted about the bodies being brought down earlier.
“It is with much regret that I have to inform that there have been fatalities at Mt Kinabalu. Details will be announced tomorrow. #tremor,” he tweeted via his official Twitter account @MasidiM tonight.
Meanwhille, stranded climbers on Mount Kinabalu’s summit plateau have successfully made their descent to the Panar Laban area at Km6 which has huts.
At about 11.50pm, several of them arrived at the Timpohon Gate which is the gateway to Mount Kinabalu.
Masidi earlier had also confirmed the climbers making their descent, disclosing that these 139 climbers had decided to descend to the National Park headquarters at the foothills with the assistance of the rescue teams.
It was reported that Fire and Rescue Services Department personnel, and their specially trained Storm team, as well as the Smart Team and soldiers had all gone up to bring these climbers down.
More are expected to arrive at the National Park in the wee hours.
The climbers were stranded earlier and were not allowed to descend due to the loose and falling rocks.
