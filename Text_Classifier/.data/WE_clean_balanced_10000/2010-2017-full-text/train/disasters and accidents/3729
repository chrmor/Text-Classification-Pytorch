18 Feared Dead in Nepalese Air Crash
KATMANDU, Nepal — A Nepal Airlines plane bound for the city of Jumla from Katmandu, the capital, crashed in the forests of western Nepal on Sunday, almost certainly killing all 18 people aboard, officials said.
An official at Tribhuvan International Airport in Katmandu blamed bad weather for the crash, saying it had been snowing for much of the day. The plane did not have de-icing equipment, which is needed in such conditions, the official said.
The plane crashed around 1 p.m. in the forests near Arghakhachi. Sushil Ghimire, Nepal’s tourism secretary, said that its burning wreckage had been located.
Civil aviation officials said there was almost no chance that anyone could be rescued from the crash site.
