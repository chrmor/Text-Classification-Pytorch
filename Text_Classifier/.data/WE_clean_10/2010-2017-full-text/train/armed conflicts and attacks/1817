Ten die and 27 injured in clashes in Mogadishu
Four Ugandan peacekeepers were killed and eight wounded in Mogadishu today when Islamist rebels fired mortars at the presidential palace. Six civilians were killed and 19 wounded in a separate shelling incident in the city involving African Union troops and the al-Shabaab Islamist group, which is linked to al-Qaida. Last week, al-Shabaab vowed to intensify its fight against the UN-backed government, led by President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, which it denounces as a puppet of the west. Its insurgents then stormed a hotel in Mogadishu, killing 31 people, including MPs.
Uganda and Burundi have deployed more than 6,300 troops in Somalia to guard the port and airport and shield President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed from attack.
Ahmed said he needed more international assistance to deal with the Islamist militants who launched their first attack on foreign soil in July, killing 79 people in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in twin bomb attacks.
"It is quite impractical to expect Somalia alone to contain the evil al-Qaida-al-Shabaab alliance, as Somalia is emerging from 20 years of destruction and a chaotic political environment," Ahmed said.
Political analysts say the presence of foreign troops in Somalia allows militants to pose as nationalist champions with a mandate for the kind of devastating attacks such as last week's. The African Union said it had reinforced security on the strategic Maka al-Mukaaram road, which runs from the centre of Mogadishu near the presidential palace to the port. Its loss would be a severe blow to the government.
