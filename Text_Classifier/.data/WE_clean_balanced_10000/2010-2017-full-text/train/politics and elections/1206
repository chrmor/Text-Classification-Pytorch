Rajya Sabha passes promotion quota bill to provide reservations in promotions for SCs, STs
NEW DELHI: A Constitution amendment bill providing for quota for SCs and STs in government job promotions was today passed by Rajya Sabha with an overwhelming vote of 206 in the 245-member House. 10 votes were polled against the proposed legislation, which was strongly opposed by UPA ally Samajwadi Party but pushed by another supporter BSP creating a difficult situation for the government. Those who voted against the contentious Constitution (117th Amendment) Bill, 2012, were nine members of Samajwadi Party and an independent Md Adeeb. Being a Constitution amendment bill, there was a requirement of the two-third majority, which was easily surpassed as 206 voted in favour in the House, where 216 members were present. All four members of Shiv Sena, which was also opposed to the Bill, were not present in the House. The bill, which provides for reservation proportionate to population of SCs and STs, was approved by the Union Cabinet on September 5 against the backdrop of Supreme Court quashing such a decision of the Uttar Pradesh government earlier this year. Replying to the two-day debate, Minister of State for Personnel V Narayanasamy said the bill seeks to correct the "inadequacy" in representation of SCs/STs in higher positions in government jobs. Reacting to the passage of bill providing reservation in promotions in the Rajya Sabha, Dubey said their agitation will go on. "The bill may have been passed in Rajya Sabha, but we will continue our agitation," Dubey said.
Agrawal, whose party was a clear minority in opposing the Bill in the Upper House, requested members belonging to other parties to vote not on party lines, but as per inner voice. Earlier, SP demanded proportionate reservation for Muslims through a Constitutional amendment.Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Ram Gopal Yadav said the Rajinder Sachar Committee in its report pointed out that the condition of Muslims was worse than Dalits."When quota in promotion (for SC/ST) can be given by amending Constitution, then why Muslims should not be given reservation in proportion to their population through a Constitution Amendment Bill," Yadav asked.The debate also saw demands for reservation of Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians. Ali Anwar Ansari from JD-U while supporting bill said that change of religion does not change the social condition of people and urged parties supporting the bill to expand their heart and include Dalits from among Christians and Muslims as well."We are first Dalits, then we became Muslims or Christians," Ansari said. Supporting the demand, Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) wanted to know whether Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims can be accommodated.
