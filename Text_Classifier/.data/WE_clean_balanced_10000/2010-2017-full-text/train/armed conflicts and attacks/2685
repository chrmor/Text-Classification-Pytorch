US special forces soldier killed in operation against IS in Afghanistan
A member of the US special forces has been killed while taking part in an operation against Islamic State in Afghanistan.
The soldier was fatally injured in Nangarhar province in the east of the country.
The soldier was a special forces operator and was killed in the Achin district, said US Navy Captain Bill Salvin.
The circumstances of the death were unclear and Captain Salvin said more details could be released later.
It is thought that in Afghanistan, the Sunni jihadist group is mostly based in Nangarhar and neighbouring Kunar province.
IS is suspected of carrying out several attacks on minority Shia targets.
US officials believe the group has 700 fighters in the country but their Afghan counterparts estimate the number could be about 1,500.
The Afghan Taliban, which is trying to overthrow the US-backed government in Kabul, is strongly opposed to IS and the two groups have clashed as they try to expand territory and influence.
