Karl Stagno-Novarra, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Malta, reports the pilots of the jet fighters that landed there are "senior colonels", who were ordered to bomb protesters. They refused and have defected to Malta, he said.
Then there are the videos (very graphic) of more soldiers slaughtered and then burned by their pro-Qaddafi military comrades.
