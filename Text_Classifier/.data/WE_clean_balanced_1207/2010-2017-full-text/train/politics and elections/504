Mexico celebrates bicentennial amid tight security
On its 200th birthday, the Central American nation wanted its citizens - and the world - to forget its vicious drug war and remember the country's epic history, music, whimsical folk art and continuing crusade for wider prosperity and democracy.
All were on display with a $40 million fiesta, two years in the making. About 60,000 revellers - many wearing sombreros and face paint with the red, white and green of the Mexican flag - crowded along Reforma Avenue, the capital's main promenade, cheering and yelling "Bravo!" at the start of the 1.7-mile parade of floats and dances designed by the country's top artists.
Another 25,000 gathered early at the main Zocalo plaza, where President Felipe Calderon was later set to deliver the traditional "Grito" - three shouts of "Viva Mexico" - to celebrate the 1810 uprising that resulted a decade later in independence from Spain.
However, anxiety hovered over the festivities with a heavy presence of law enforcement, some with police dogs.
In the back of many people's minds was the violence of the past year: The assassination of a gubernatorial candidate. The slaughter of 19 people at a drug rehabilitation centre. The massacre of 72 migrants who refused to smuggle drugs for a brutal gang.
Military helicopters buzzed overhead, heavily armed federal agents and metal detectors greeted revellers. In some of Mexico's most violent cities, the festivities were cancelled for fear of a drug cartel attack. While drug violence during a grand festival would have been unheard of just a few years ago - even cartel capos celebrate religion and family in Mexico - that changed during independence celebrations in 2008. A grenade attack blamed on a cartel killed eight revellers, including a 14-year-old boy, in Mr Calderon's home state of Michoacan.
