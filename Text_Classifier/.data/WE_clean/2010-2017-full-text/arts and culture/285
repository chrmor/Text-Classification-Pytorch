Convict sites now world heritage listed
It's enough to make any old lag feel warm and fuzzy all over.
Some of Australia's most important convict sites have been added to the United Nations' world heritage list, alongside such natural icons as the Great Barrier Reef.
Environment Protection and Heritage Minister Peter Garrett on Sunday welcomed the world heritage committee's decision to inscribe 11 local convict sites on the list, helping to ensure their preservation into the future.
The sites include Old Government House, the Domain, Hyde Park Barracks, Cockatoo Island and Old Great North Road in NSW, Fremantle Prison in Western Australia, and Kingston and Arthur's Vale Historic Area on Norfolk Island.
Tasmania's Port Arthur, Brickendon and Woolmers Estates, Darlington Probation Station, Coal Mines Historic Site and the Cascades Female Factory are also on the list.
Mr Garrett also announced that the federal government would transfer eastern Sydney's Malabar Headland to the NSW state government for conservation.
