Nearly 20 Kansas sixth-grade girls were injured Wednesday afternoon when their school bus took a curving highway ramp too fast and overturned, authorities said.
Eighteen students and the driver were taken to five hospitals in the area, about 18 miles from Kansas City, Mo. Most injuries were described as broken bones, cuts and bruises.
But several students suffered concussions, one of whom may have a more serious brain injury, University of Kansas Hospital spokeswoman Jill Chadwick told the Kansas City Star. One student may have a possible serious spinal injury.
Five students were expected to go be released later Wednesday from the university hospital but three to four would remain overnight.
The bus, carrying 36 students from the private Pembroke Hill School in Kansas City, slid off an exit ramp connecting Kansas 7 with Kansas 32 in Bonner Springs and rolled about 1 p.m. CT, the state Highway Patrol told KCTV.
A witness described students coming out of the bus crying and screaming for their mothers.
"My girls confirmed they were on the exit ramp and probably going too fast, and rolled and rolled," Kate Banks, whose two daughters were on the bus, told the Star.
Both daughters were taken to Overland Park Regional Medical Center. One suffered a possible broken collar bone, the other an elbow injury. Both had cuts and scrapes.
A bus carrying sixth-grade boys from Pembroke Hill was following but not involved in the accident.
The students were headed to a camp in Linwood, Kan., for an overnight "bonding experience" to begin the new school year, a Pembroke official said.
