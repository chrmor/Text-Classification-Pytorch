Mark Arbib, aka CIA Agent 007
Mark Arbib: otherwise known as CIA Agent 007.
Visitors to the senator's Wikipedia page this morning may have been surprised to learn his role as Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, among other portfolios, had been usurped by some decidedly more colourful titles.
CIA agent, US Mole, Traitor, and US Embassy Hero were listed below the right-wing Labor powerbroker's photograph on the popular online encyclopedia following revelations by WikiLeaks today that Mr Arbib was as a confidential contact of the United States embassy in Canberra.
And the Wikipedia tinkering didn't stop there.
''Mark Victor Arbib (born 9 November 1971) is an Australian Traitor and spy for America,'' his Wikipedia page read just after 4am AEDT today.
