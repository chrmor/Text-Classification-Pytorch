Bangladesh workers killed in wage protest
At least three people are dead and dozens injured in Bangladesh after police tried to break up a crowd of garment workers protesting for higher wages.
Bullets and tear gas were reportedly fired during Sunday's protest in the port city of Chittagong, where workers burned tires and furniture to block traffic.
Police official Reza Al Hasan confirmed authorities used the gas and opened fire after workers attacked factories and smashed vehicles at the Chittagong Export Processing Zone. However, he would not comment on how three men in the crowd died.
The zone houses about 70 foreign companies that employ about 150,000 workers.
Workers were demanding a new minimum wage that was promised to them earlier this year. The new pay was supposed to be implemented last month.
The same issue sparked similar protests on both Saturday and Sunday in and around the capital, Dhaka, about 220 kilometres northwest of Chittagong.
In the first increase since 2006, the government raised the official minimum wage to 3,000 takas ($45 Cdn) a month from 1,662 takas ($25 Cdn).
Garment workers in Bangladesh are among the lowest-paid in the world, according to the International Trade Union Confederation, a Vienna-based labour rights group.
