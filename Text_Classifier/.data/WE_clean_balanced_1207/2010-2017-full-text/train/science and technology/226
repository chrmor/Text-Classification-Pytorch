SpaceX rocket test launch successful – Daily Breeze
Hawthorne rocket maker SpaceX has taken a big step in its push to develop reusable launch vehicles.
The company officially known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. released a video Monday showing the test flight of its Grasshopper rocket, which took off and hovered 12 stories off the ground.
The test flight was conducted Dec. 17 at SpaceX’s rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. The rocket rose 131 feet, hovered and landed safely on the pad using closed loop thrust vector and throttle control. The entire test lasted 29 seconds.
SpaceX sees development of a reusable rocket as a way to significantly reduce launch costs. Development of reusable rockets has so far eluded the aerospace industry.
Such a vehicle would also advance SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s dream of sending people to Mars to establish human colonies. The idea is for the Red Planet’s new inhabitants to be able to soar to Mars and then use the same rocket to return to Earth.
SpaceX’s Grasshopper stands 10 stories tall and consists of the company’s Falcon 9 rocket first stage, a SpaceX Merlin 1D engine, four steel landing legs with hydraulic dampers and a steel support structure.
The latest test was a major improvement over the Grasshopper’s previous flight tests. In November, the rocket flew 17.7 feet, or two stories, and hovered briefly. An earlier test in September saw the rocket rise six feet.
SpaceX said it expects to continue testing the Grasshopper with “successively more sophisticated flights” over the next several months.
In business for only 10 years, SpaceX has already leaped past more established rocket companies in some respects.
For example, in May, SpaceX became the first private company to send a spacecraft to successfully berth with the International Space Station.
The company sent a second successful mission to the ISS in October, starting the first of at least a dozen regular flights to the orbiting outpost.
