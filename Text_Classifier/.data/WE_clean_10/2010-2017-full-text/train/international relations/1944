Kurds plan to declare federal region in Syria
Syrian Kurds plan to declare a federal region in northern Syria after being excluded from peace talks aimed at ending the 5-year-old conflict, according to media reports Wednesday.
The move will combine three Kurdish-led autonomous areas into a federal system in what is set to alarm neighboring Turkey, Reuters reported.
Nawaf Khalil, of the Democratic Union Party, told The Associated Press that the envisioned area would include representation for Turkmen — ethnic Turks who live in Syria — Arabs and Kurds.
The declaration is expected to be made at a Kurdish conference Wednesday in the northern Syrian town of Rmeilan, the news agency said.
Bashar Ja’afari, Syria's ambassador to the U.N., dismissed the plans Wednesday, telling reporters in Geneva that he would not comment on “unilateral statements coming from here and there.”
On Saturday, Syria's government ruled out the idea of a federal system, but its ally Russia said it could be possible, Reuters reported.
The peace talks resumed in Geneva on Monday, a day before the anniversary of the start of the war.
The PYD, the main Kurdish opposition group in Syria, was left out of the negotiations because Turkey sees it as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States.
Russia's defense ministry said its warplanes continued to withdraw from Syria on Wednesday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin made the surprise announcement that his country would remove most of its forces from Syria.
The Russian airbase in the province of Latakia and a naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartous will continue to operate, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
