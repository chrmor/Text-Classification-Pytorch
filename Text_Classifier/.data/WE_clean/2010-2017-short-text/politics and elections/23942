With most of the votes counted, the opposition conservatives of former president Nicolas Sarkozy's party win in six of the country’s 13 regions and lead in the Paris region. The ruling Socialists of President François Hollande's party capture five regions. The winner in Corsica is not affiliated with a major party. France's far-right National Front (FN) fails to win a single region but did record its best showing in its history. Voter turnout was 58 percent. Definitive results are expected Monday.
