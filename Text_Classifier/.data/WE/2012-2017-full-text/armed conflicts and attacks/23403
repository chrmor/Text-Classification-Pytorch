Islamic State releases purported new audio message from top leader vowing to continue fight
The Russian Defense Ministry said in June that there was a “high probability” that Baghdadi was killed in a Russian airstrike near the Syrian city of Raqqah, the capital of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate and its operations hub. But U.S. Defense Secretary and other senior Pentagon officials later said that they believed Baghdadi was still alive and that U.S. forces would continue to search for him.
