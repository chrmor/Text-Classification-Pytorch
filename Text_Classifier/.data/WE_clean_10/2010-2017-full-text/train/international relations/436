Kyiv Bans Russian Airlines From Flying Into Ukraine
Ukraineâ€™s government says it is banning all Russian airlines from flying into Ukraine from October 25 in response to Moscow's decision in September to impose a similar ban on Ukrainian airlines.
The punitive measure announced on October 12 concerns only two carriers -- Siberia's UTair and the tiny Saratov Airlines -- because Kyiv had earlier barred bigger Russian firms in reprisal for Moscow's March 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on September 16 blacklisted Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot and three other state-held companies that offered regular flights to Ukraine.
The State Air Service in Kyiv said the Russian carriers are not allowed to land in Ukraine but would still be permitted to cross its airspace to other destination points.
The only remaining options for air travel between Russia and Ukraine are by flying via the Baltic states or some other country with relatively convenient access to Russia.
