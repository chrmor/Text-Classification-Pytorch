Iraq car bombs cause Baghdad carnage
Several car bombs have exploded around the Iraqi capital Baghdad, killing at least 39 people, officials say.
The bombs were placed in parked cars and detonated over a 30-minute period in busy streets, mainly in Shia areas.
Separately, a bomber blew himself up in the northern city of Mosul near troops queuing at a bank, killing 14 people.
Countrywide violence, often fuelled by sectarian divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, has reached its highest level since 2008.
Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, according to the UN.
Hundreds more have been killed in October.
Sunni militants, including the local offshoot of al-Qaeda, are often blamed for the attacks, which usually target Shia areas.
The Shia-led government has been accused of failing to address grievances among the Sunni Arab minority, including allegations of abuses by security forces.
The wave of attacks in and around Baghdad on Sunday targeted areas including markets and bus stations.
As well as those killed, at least 100 people were injured in the attacks.
More than 30 people were hurt in the Mosul blast, which was the single most deadly attack of the day.
