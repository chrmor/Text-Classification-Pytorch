Hall of Fame trainer Gil Clancy dies at 88
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gil Clancy, a Hall of Fame trainer and manager who worked with many top fighters including Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman, died on Thursday at age 88.
The International Boxing Hall of Fame did not give a cause of death but said its flag will fly at half-staff in memory of Clancy, who was elected into the Hall in 1993.
While Clancy worked with some of the sport’s best fighters, he was best known for his long association with another Hall of Famer, Emile Griffith, whom Clancy and Howie Albert guided to the welterweight and middleweight titles.
“Gil Clancy was one of boxing’s truly great minds,” Hall of Fame Executive Director Edward Brophy said in a statement. “As a trainer and manager he was held in the highest regard by his peers.”
