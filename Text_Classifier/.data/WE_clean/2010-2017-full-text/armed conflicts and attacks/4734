Paris : protest for the democracy in Algeria
At the initiative of the National Coordination for Change and Democracy in Algeria, a peaceful protest took place today in Paris.
Denouncing the disappearances of democrat opponents and the police brutalities, participants asserted their pride and claimed to more freedom and dignity in a democratic and social Algeria.
Among their demands: stop the state of emergency, open the political and media fields, release the prisoners following the riots.
And some very strong slogans: "assassin power", "give voice to people" and the now famous "DÃ©gage !" (Get out!)
