Italian prime minister warns over African migrants
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has warned that thousands of Africans will continue to risk their lives trying to travel to Europe unless the civil war ends in Libya.
His comments come as figures suggest that more than 10,000 migrants have been rescued trying to cross the Mediterranean in the past week alone.
