Iran rebukes Azerbaijan for allegedly aiding Israel's Mossad -  Haaretz - Israel News
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Azerbaijan's ambassador on Sunday to rebuke him for his country's alleged link to Mossad operations against the regime in Tehran, the state-run news agency IRNA reported.
Earlier Sunday, the London Times reported that Israel's Mossad is using Azerbaijan as a base to spy on the Islamic Republic, citing testimony from an anonymous Mossad agent.
According to IRNA, Iran's foreign ministry handed Javanshir Akhundov, the Azeri Ambassador to Iran, a note calling on the government of Azerbaijan to stop the Mossad's anti-Iran operations in its country.
"Following the movements of the terrorists involved in assassination of Iranian scientists in Azerbaijan republic and the facilities provided to them to go to Tel Aviv in collaboration with Mossad spy networks, Azeri Ambassador to Iran Javanshir Akhundov was summoned to the Foreign Ministry," IRNA quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying in a statement.
Akhundov, in response, said he would convey the message to the Azeri government and bring back a reply.
