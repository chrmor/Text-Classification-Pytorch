Munich Shooting Probably Not  Linked to ISIS, Police Chief Says
There were "no indications" that the teenage gunman who killed nine people and then himself at a mall in the German city of Munich had links to ISIS or any other terror group, police said Saturday.
Seven of the nine who were killed during the Friday evening rampage were themselves teens, officials announced. Three were female. The attack also injured 27, police said at a news conference.
The gunman shot himself in the head after police made contact with him, authorities said. German media have identified the suspect as David S.
Searches revealed that the 18-year-old who was born and raised in the Bavarian capital had "looked intensively" at the subject of "shooting rampages," Police Chief Hubertus Andrae told reporters.
A book entitled "Rampage in Head: Why Students Kill" was found among the suspect's belongings, officials said.
"There is no indication that there is a link to ISIS," Andrae said.
That the shooting was carried out on the fifth anniversary of white supremacist Anders Breivik's deadly rampage in Norway indicated that the attack may have been motivated by far-right ideology, he said.
It also appeared that the attacker had hacked a young woman's Facebook account and posted a message to lure people to the mall for a free meal, said police investigator Robert Heimberger.
Munich woke up to a state of emergency the day after the shooting spree, with police scouring the city for clues to explain why the teen opened fire at a McDonald's attached to the Olympia Einkaufszentrum shopping center Friday night.
