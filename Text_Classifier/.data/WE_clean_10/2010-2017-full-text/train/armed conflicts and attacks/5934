Bomb Explodes Outside Greek Parliament, No Injuries Reported
A home-made time bomb exploded outside the Greek Parliament on Saturday evening in an unprecedented terrorist attack, which caused no injuries and only minor damage.
It was the first time a guerrilla group placed a bomb just 30 meters from the Parliament in the center of Athens. Fifteen minutes before the blast at around 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Saturday evening, there had been a warning call to a local newspaper.
Police managed to evacuate the crowded Syntagma Square in front of the Parliament. Only the presidential guards standing at the nearby monument of the Unknown Soldier didn't evacuate the area.
Counterterrorist experts, who rushed to gather evidence from what was left from the explosive device and footage from surveillance cameras, estimate that the attack was meant to be mostly symbolic.
Greek far Left groups who have stepped up attacks since December 2008, after the fatal shooting of a teenager by police fire, have threatened with more attacks against political and financial targets.
Police were on alert, because on Jan. 12 the socialist new government which has promised a tough antiterrorist policy celebrates its first 100 days in office.
On Dec. 27, 2009 there had been a similar explosion that caused severe damage to the offices of a Greek insurance company on a main Athens avenue.
A guerrilla group called "Conspiracy of Nuclei of Fire- Nihilists Sect" claimed responsibility for that attack.
