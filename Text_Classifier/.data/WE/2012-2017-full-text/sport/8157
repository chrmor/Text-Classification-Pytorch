Canberra Cavalry wins Asia Series
"We started at the bottom now we’re here." And here means champions of Asia.
That saying has been the mantra of the Canberra Cavalry, who stunned the baseball world to beat the Uni-President Lions 14-4 in the Asia Series final in Taiwan on Wednesday night.
It refers to them being the Australian Baseball League wooden spooners just 12 months ago.
Since then they’ve won Canberra’s first ever Claxton Shield as ABL champions and now they’ve conquered the multi-million dollar teams of Asia.
