Palestinian 'attackers' killed by Israeli truck driver
Two Palestinians have been shot dead in the West Bank by an Israeli truck driver, who said they attacked and tried to rob him, Israeli police say.
The unnamed driver, who suffered a head wound, told police he opened fire after the Palestinians came at him with chains and iron bars, reports said.
The incident happened in the village of al-Samu, near Hebron.
There have been recent clashes between settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank, where tensions remain high.
The driver in the incident comes from the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, according to Israeli media reports.
Palestinian media identified the dead men as Anwar Abed Rabbo, 27, from Yatta, and Naeem al-Najjar, 32, from Idhna.
A third Palestinian is reported to have been injured in the shooting.
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said it appeared that the driver had been lured to the location by the Palestinians under the pretence of using his services, Israeli media reported.
Palestinian Maan news agency quoted Yatta municipality chief Zahran Abu Qbetta as saying the men who were killed were on their way to work at the time of the shooting.
