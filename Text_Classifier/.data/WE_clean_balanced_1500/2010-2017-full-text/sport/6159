Tina Maze Wins Super-Combined and Secures Overall World Cup Title
Tina Maze of Slovenia clinched her first overall World Cup title Sunday, winning the super-combined in Meribel, France, for her eighth victory this season with nine races to go.
Maze led the downhill section and coasted home in the slalom after Maria Höfl-Riesch crashed out of contention. She also tied a season record with her 18th top-three finish.
Maze has 1,844 points and is all but certain to smash the season record — for men or women — of 2,000 held by Hermann Maier.
“It’s really special because it’s so difficult to win,” Maze said. “For me it’s special to continue this level of skiing.”
She is also seeking to become only the third woman to win all five discipline races in one season and needs only a downhill win to do so.
