Pro-Assad Syrian official killed in Lebanon
A senior Syrian official, Mohammed Darrar Jamo, has been shot dead in the southern Lebanese town of Sarafand.
Mr Jamo, a supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was attacked early on Wednesday morning as he entered his house.
Lebanese sources say gunmen opened fire on him but left his wife, who was with him at the time, unharmed.
The attack is being seen as the latest sign of how the conflict in Syria is threatening to destabilise Lebanon.
The Syrian state news agency, Sana, said Mohammed Darrar Jamo was head of the political and international relations division of the International Organisation for Arab Immigrants.
He had also frequently appeared as a political expert on Arabic-language television channels, defending President Assad.
Clashes between groups backing different sides in Syria's civil war have become increasingly common in Lebanon.
On Tuesday, a convoy carrying members of the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah was hit by a roadside bomb near the Syrian border.
The blast hit a vehicle not far from the Masnaa border crossing, on a key route between Beirut and Damascus, killing one person and wounding two others.
Officials were unable to confirm whether the dead man was a member of Hezbollah.
Several other vehicles have also been attacked recently in the same area. One of the blasts injured two Lebanese soldiers. The explosions took place in the Bekaa region, considered a Hezbollah stronghold.
Last week a car bomb injured more than 50 people in a southern suburb of the capital, Beirut - an area controlled by Hezbollah. In late May, rockets were fired in the same district.
