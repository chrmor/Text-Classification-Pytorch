Fire, blast in NYC's Chinatown injure 8
Eight people were hurt in an explosion and fire in Chinatown in lower Manhattan on Thursday, authorities said.
Three of the injuries were described as serious and five were not life-threatening.
A law enforcement official says an explosion is believe to have rocked the five-story building on Pike Street, near Henry Street, and was from an "unknown source."
FDNY said there was also a partial collapse of the rear first floor, where the fire originated.
Smoke could be seen billowing from the neighborhood.
Several people were helped away from the affected building.
