Van Marwijk quits as Netherlands coach
Bert van Marwijk has stepped down as Netherlands coach after the team failed to make it beyond the group stage at UEFA EURO 2012.
"I had my doubts but I have decided to take this step anyway," said Van Marwijk, whose resignation was confirmed after two meetings with the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB).
The KNVB's director of professional football, Bert van Oostveen, said: "The KNVB are very thankful to Van Marwijk. He did extraordinary work in making a World Cup final and achieving first place in the FIFA rankings. I personally look back with very fond memories on our cooperation. Of course it is sad to have to say goodbye now, but we have to be realistic."
The former Feyenoord and Borussia Dortmund coach, 60, replaced Marco van Basten in July 2008. He guided his side, after a perfect qualifying campaign, to the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Spain. The Oranje also qualified impressively for the EURO but were beaten by Denmark, Germany and Portugal in Ukraine as they finished bottom of Group B.
