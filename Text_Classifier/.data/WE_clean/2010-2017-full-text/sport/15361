The 2013 Candidates Tournament will live long in the memory, and its conclusion was as unexpected as it was amazing! The two remaining contenders, Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik both had to keep one eye on each other's games, with Vladimir Kramnik needing to score a better result than his Norwegian rival to win the tournament.
Today is April Fool's day, but this is no joke: Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik both lost their final round games!  Incredibly, Vassily Ivanchuk gradually outplayed Vladimir Kramnik, and Magnus Carlsen went astray in rare (for him) time trouble to turn an equal position into a loss.
Carlsen was first to resign, but relatively safe in the knowledge that Kramnik was probably losing as well. What a finale!
Two rounds ago, it seemed that Vassily Ivanchuk had cost Magnus Carlsen victory in the tournament, but by beating Vladimir Kramnik in the final round, he ended up saving his skin!  Try to fit a conspiracy story around that...
