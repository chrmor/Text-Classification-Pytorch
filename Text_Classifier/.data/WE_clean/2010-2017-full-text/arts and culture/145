Memorial plaque to go on Centaur wreck
The federal government has approved the laying of a memorial plaque on the sunken wreck of the wartime hospital ship Centaur.
The Centaur was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine off the Queensland coast during World War II. Just 64 of the 332 people on board survived.
The wreckage lay undiscovered for 67 years until world renowned shipwreck hunter David Mearns located the Centaur on December 20 last year, 48km east of the southern tip of Moreton Island at a depth of 2,059 metres.
On Sunday, his crew aboard the Seahorse Spirit sent a submarine robot down to capture footage proving beyond doubt that the Centaur's resting place had been found.
For the past two days the crew has taken video footage and photos of the wreck, dredging up powerful emotions for the families and friends of those who perished in 1943.
Artefacts identified include the Centaur's inscribed bell, a distinctive star on the bow, and a corroded identification number 47.
