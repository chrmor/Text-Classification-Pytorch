Irish politician Joan Collins names crime journalist Paul Williams and sports star Ronan O'Gara under Dáil privilege as being among those to benefit from having their penalty points for traffic offences cancelled by the Garda Síochána. Justice Minister Alan Shatter calls Collins's action a "total disgrace" and she is reported to a Leinster House watchdog called the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.
