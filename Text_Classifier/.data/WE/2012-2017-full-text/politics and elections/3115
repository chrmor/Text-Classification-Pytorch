Obama wanted Jerusalem change to platform
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Yahoo News on Wednesday night on the floor of the Democratic National Convention that the move to amend the party's platform to identify Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reflects the wishes of President Obama.
"I think the platform is what the president of the United States wanted," she said, mobbed by reporters. "It was amended to do that."
