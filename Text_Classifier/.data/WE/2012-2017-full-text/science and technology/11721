Health alert after Disneyland linked to measles outbreak
Health officials said it is likely that a single person with measles visited the parks during that period, exposing the other visitors. "If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your healthcare provider," state health officer Ron Chapman said in a statement. "The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated."
