David Heidemann's body found nine days after Cyclone Debbie flooding
The body of one of three men who went missing during south-east Queensland's big wet has been found.
David Heidemann, 50, was last seen in his home town of Mondure, west of Gympie, on March 30.
He had told family he was going to visit a friend, but never returned and was reported missing.
The SES found his body in the region's Barambah Creek about 8:30am.
A report was being prepared for the coroner.
A 58-year-old man who went missing at Mount Pleasant, near Mackay, was found on Friday.
But a man in his 60s who went bushwalking in the Lamington National Park is still missing.
He set off with a lack of supplies and failed to return to a meeting point with the rest of a large sightseeing group on February 29.
