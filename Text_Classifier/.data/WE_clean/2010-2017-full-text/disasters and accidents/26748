Black Box From Missing EgyptAir Flight 804 Is Said to Be Detected
PARIS â€” A French naval vessel fitted with sophisticated underwater sensors has picked up a signal believed to have emanated from one of two data recorders from EgyptAir Flight 804, Egyptian and French officials said on Wednesday.
The flight crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on May 19 while en route to Cairo from Paris, killing all 66 people on board. Data signals, and the discovery of wreckage and human remains, have suggested a rapid loss of control just before the crash.
But the cause of the disaster remains a mystery. No terrorist group has claimed responsibility, though the Egyptian aviation minister, Sherif Fathy, has said that terrorism is a more likely cause for the crash than a technical failure. The flight recorders will be critical for determining whether the crash was the result of a deliberate act or an accident.
The vessel that picked up the signal, the survey ship Laplace, has been taking part in the search for the data recorders from the Airbus A320 since last week.
