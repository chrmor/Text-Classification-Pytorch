Brazilian state hit by floods ahead of World Cup
Floods have driven almost 13,000 people from their homes in the southern Brazilian state of Parana two days before the FIFA World Cup begins, officials have said.
The state's civil defence department reported that flooding hit 132 cities, killing at least nine people.
It is unclear if the floods have affected Arena da Baixada stadium in the state capital Curitiba, which will host the first of four games on Monday when Iran and Nigeria do battle in Group F.
Defending champions Spain trained in the city on Monday.Â
