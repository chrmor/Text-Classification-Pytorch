ABC Four Corners crew grateful for support after being detained in Malaysia
ABC Four Corners journalist Linton Besser says he and his camera operator are well and grateful for the support they have received after being detained in Malaysia.
Besser and camera operator Louie Eroglu were detained, and then later released, while trying to question Prime Minister Najib Razak over a corruption scandal.
They have not been charged with any offence but their passports have been seized and they have been told not to leave the country, the ABC reported.
Besser tweeted on Monday that he and Eroglu were grateful for the support and kind messages they had received.
