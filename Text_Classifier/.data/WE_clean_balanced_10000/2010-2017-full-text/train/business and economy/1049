HP to pay $61m to settle fraud claim
Hewlett-Packard has agreed to pay $US55 million ($A61 million) to settle claims the US computer giant defrauded the US government, the Justice Department announced on Monday.
The settlement resolves allegations that HP paid kickbacks to systems integrator companies in return for recommendations that US agencies buy HP products, the department said in a statement.
It also resolves claims that a 2002 contract between HP and the General Services Administration, the US government's chief procurement body, was defectively priced because HP provided incomplete information to the GSA.
The 2002 contract involved sales of computer equipment and software to federal agencies by the California-based company, the world's largest computer maker.
"Contractors must deal fairly with the government when doing business with federal agencies," US assistant attorney general Tony West said.
"As this case demonstrates, we will take action against those who seek to taint the government procurement process with illegal kickbacks," West said.
