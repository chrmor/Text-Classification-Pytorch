House ethics panel charges Rep. Maxine Waters
A House ethics panel charged California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters today with breaking unspecified ethics rules -- making the 10-term veteran the second lawmaker to face an ethics trial just months before the midterm election.
Waters has been under investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics and the ethics committee for requesting a meeting in 2008 with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to discuss minority-owned banks. The conversation focused on a single bank, OneUnited, according to a 2009 OCE report released today. Waters' husband had been a board member and stock holder in the bank at the time of the meeting.
The House ethics committee statement does not indicate when the committee will disclose the charges.
The new allegations come less than a week after an investigative panel formally charged Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., with 13 ethics violations stemming from donations he solicited for an education center bearing his name and his failure to pay taxes. Rangel has said his lawyers are trying to negotiate a settlement to avoid a lengthy trial.
In statement, Waters said she did not violate House rules.
"Therefore, I simply will not be forced to admit to something I did not do and instead have chosen to respond to charges made by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in a public hearing," she said.
"The record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor I benefited in any way, engaged in improper action or influenced anyone," she said.
