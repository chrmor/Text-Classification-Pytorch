Conservative party Cardiff conference - as it happened
When Tony Blair was prime minister, he famously gave a conference speech attacking the "forces of conservatism". For obvious reasons, it would be a bit embarrassing for George Osborne to lambast the "foc" but he probably had the same target in mind as Blair (bureaucrats and public service unions) when he told the Conservative spring conference in his speech yesterday that he wanted to "confront the forces of stagnation that stand in the way of success".
Today David Cameron is addressing the conference and he is going to deliver much the same message. But instead of labelling his opponents "forces of conservatism" or "forces of stagnation", he's going to declare war on the "enemies of enterprise". According to the extracts from the speech released in advance, he is going to say this:
Cameron is going to close the conference when he speaks this afternoon. The morning session only lasts two and a half hours, but it will feature six other cabinet ministers. Here's a full agenda.
10am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, opens a session on the alternative vote. There will then be a panel session on the discussion chaired by Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary.
Around 10.45am: A session on public services. Speakers include Michael Gove, the education secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, and Theresa May, the home secretary.
I'll be live blogging all today's conference events. If you want to know what happened yesterday, all the details are here.
Liam Fox, the defence secretary, has just given an interview to the Andrew Marr show. Today the Sunday Times is reporting that eight SAS soldiers who were sent to Libya to make contact with the opposition forces are being held by the anti-Gaddafi rebels. Fox was asked if he could confirm the story. This is what he said:
That suggests that the story is true.
Having quickly looked at the papers, here are some of the articles that caught my eye. I've focused on the ones relevant to the Tory conference.
• Matthew d'Ancona in the Sunday Telegraph says that David Cameron will adopt a Thatcherite tactic when he attacks "bureaucrats in government departments" in his speech to the conference this afternoon.
• Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome sketches out the battleplan that he thinks Cameron should follow to stay in power.
• Robert Wattsin the Sunday Times (paywall) says John Hutton's review of public sector pensions will propose cutting the amount public sector workers can claim in pensions before they are 65.
• Marie Woolf in the Sunday Times (paywall) says the House of Lords appointments committee stopped Douglas Hogg getting a peerage because of his infamous moat-cleaning expenses claim, even though David Cameron nominated him for the Lords.
• The Sunday Times (paywall) says David Cameron deserves the nickname "two Jags".
William Hague is speaking now. According to the programme, he's meant to be speaking about the alternative vote. But he's doing a wide-ranging foreign affairs speech. From what I've heard so far, it does not seem to have anything new in it policy-wise, but it's full of sweeping, muscular rhetoric and lines designed to appeal to the Tory faithful, like "we've put the C back in Foreign and Commonwealth Office", which got a strong round of applause. They like the Commonwealth in this party, perhaps because it's an organisation headed by the Queen.
I'll post a proper summary in a moment, when I've read the full text.
I've now read the William Hague speech in full. Hague's strongest rhetoric came when he was attacking Labour - "the last Labour government ... combined ruinous economic policy at home with a rudderless approach to the wider world" - but the only part of the speech with any news interest came at the end, when Hague talked about Libya. Recently the Times ran a story about the splits in the cabinet over Libya, identifying Michael Gove and George Osborne as the leading "hawks" and Hague as the leading "dove". Hague did not say anything in policy terms that was remotely different from what other cabinet ministers have been saying. But his tone was more guarded than the tone adopted by Osborne yesterday. This is what Osborne had to say in his speech:
And this is what Hague said today.
While reading the Hague speech, I was also listening to Kenneth Clarke deliver his speech about AV. At one point he said that in his experience the British electorate always got it right - which is tantamount to saying that the Tories deserved to lose in 1997, in 2001 and in 2005, and that David Cameron didn't deserve to win in 2010. For some mysterious reason, the Conservative party press office haven't released Clarke's text.
Alastair Campbell has used Twitter to tell us that he's not impressed by Cameron's war on the enemies of enterprise.
Last night Andy Burnham, Labour's general election coordinator, put out this comment in advance of David Cameron's speech today.
But one Labour figure seems to think David Cameron is showing rather good leadership qualities. In the fascinating preface he's written for the paperback edition of his autobiography, The Third Man, Mandelson says Cameron "seems to display skilful political footwork and remarkable confidence when he is in a tight corner". (As I reported yesterday, Mandelson also thinks the government is in many respects essentially Blairite.)
Who's going to be in charge of local policing under the government's reforms? Well, you are (if you're a reader in England and Wales). Theresa May, the home secretary, is speaking now and that is how she's explaining the government's police reforms. Voters are going to elect local police and crime commissioners and police forces will be told to hold regular beat meetings.
Although there's a strong cabinet turn-out at the conference this morning, ministers are doing their best not to make any news. David Cameron's speech will be the event of the day and his colleagues seem to be doing their best not to hog the headlines. Andrew Lansley spoke without notes and, from what I heard, he did not go beyond explaining the reasons for the NHS reforms in terms he has used before. Theresa May did speak from a text. Again, she did not have anything particularly new to say, but she was even more explicit than she was in the speech she gave on police pay and conditions last week about the link between cutting pay and conditions and saving jobs.
The conclusions of the review of police pay and conditions being conducted by Tom Winsor are going to be published on Tuesday.
Iain Duncan Smith is speaking now. He has come up with what may be the best joke of the morning. Referring to Ed Miliband's desire to speak up for the "squeezed middle", Duncan Smith says he knows all about the "squeezed middle". At cabinet he sits between Ken Clarke and Eric Pickles, he reveals.
Iain Duncan Smith has just finished his speech. Mostly it was about his plans to the universal credit - "we will make sure it pays more to be in work than it does to sit on benefits, and because of that, we can say that if there's work you can do, we expect you to do it, or no more benefits" - but the most interesting passage came when he addressed the Labour claim that welfare reform will be pointless if there are not enough jobs in the economy for people to take up.
Michael Gove has joined the war on the "forces of stagnation". Earlier (see 9.15am) I said that George Osborne and David Cameron seemed to have bureaucrats and the public service unions in mind when they railed against the forces of stagnation and the enemies of enterprise. But, in his speech to the conference, Gove added the education system to the list of enemies.
Gove delivered a series of statistics showing how children on free school meals - the very poorest - underperform in exams. He also said the government was achieving "the fastest rate of school reform in the history of this country" because 200 academies have been created over the last seven months.
Here's a lunchtime summary. • Ministers have refused to deny claims that up to eight SAS officers have been captured by opposition forces in Libya. "I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team is in Benghazi. We are in touch with them. But it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on that," Liam Fox, the defence secretary, replied when asked about the revelation published in the Sunday Times. The news is highly embarrassing for the government because David Cameron said publicly that the British would be making contact with the rebel forces in Libya. That strategy now seems to have backfired.
• Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, has said that the Tories deserved to lose the elections in 1997, 2001 and 2005. This is how he put it in his speech to the conference.
Clarke's comments also appear to suggest that he does not think David Cameron deserved to win an outright majority in 2010.
• William Hague has said that he supports Prince Andrew's work as a UK trade ambassador. Asked about claims that the prince has displayed poor judgment in the role, Hague told the BBC's Politics Show that he had full confidence in the prince. "I've seen a lot of benefits that he has brought in in countries that I have visited where he's been performing that role," Hague said. "I'm not an expert on what you say are the embarrassments, I haven't had time, with everything going on in the Middle East, to look at those things. But certainly I've seen around the world a lot of good that he has done for this country."
David Cameron will be delivering his speech to the Tory conference in about 20 minutes. It will mostly be about domestic policy, although we are expecting him to say something about Libya. In the Sunday Telegraph Matthew d'Ancona says it will be Cameron's "strongest argument yet for the virtue of enterprise".
A film about the achievements of the government is being played in the conference hall now. David Cameron will speak once it's finished.
David Cameron is starting now. He starts with a tribute to the work of the Welsh Conservatives. "Let us show Labour they cannot take Wales for granted," he says.
Cameron says the government is delivering on its promises. Iain Duncan Smith is ensuring the work always pays, William Hague is imposing a referendum lock to stop powers being transferred to Brussels and Michael Gove is making sure that children learn "the great history of our country".
Cameron mentions other policies too, but Duncan Smith, Hague and Gove are the only ministers to get a name-check here.
Cameron quotes from a letter supposedly sent to him by someone called Ray. Ray said he was a Labour-supporter and was "determined to despise" Cameron. But Cameron's policies "appear to be good for this country", Ray apparently wrote.
Cameron says he has never met anyone who has told him that what they really want, to restore faith in politics, is the alternative vote.
(Note to Cameron. You're very welcome to spend a morning at the Guardian. Hard as it might be to believe, some people are rather keen on AV.)
Cameron says having AV would be like having the Olympics and not giving the gold medal to the sprinter first over the line.
Cameron says he is still discovering examples of how Labour mismanaged the public finances.
It's not just about economics; it's about morality too, he says.
Cameron says his plans go beyond sorting out the deficit.
He is "passionate about building a bigger society", he says.
Cameron says he believes in real fairness, "not the phony fairness we've seen in this country for years, where people who do the wrong thing get rewarded".
Cameron says the government has protected the NHS, schools, families and the elderly.
Compassion is "in our nature", he says. Go to any charity sale and you will find Conservatives.
Cameron says the Tories believe in compassion abroad too. While Labour were doing "dodgy deals with dictators in the desert" - he means Libya - the Tories were volunteering in Rwanda.
On Libya, Cameron says the government's strategy is clear. It will intensify pressure on the regime, warn that crimes against humanity will be punished, provide humanitarian assistance and plan for every eventuality.
Cameron is now on the main theme of his speech: enterprise. Enterprise is vital for the economy. But it's not just about markets; it's about morals too. That's because enterprise is "not just an economic good, it's a social good".
The Conservative party is the party "of start-ups, go-getters, risk-takers", he says.
(This passage is worth quoting in full. I'll post the full quote later.)
• Cameron declares that the Conservatives, rather than Labour, are the "party of enterprise".
Cameron says that over the last decade the "enemies of enterprise" have had their way. Now he wants to take them on.
• The budget will be "the most pro-growth budget this country has seen for a generation", he says.
Cameron says the new enterprise allowance will give people with a business idea up to £2,000 to get started. A firm called Superdry clothes is now a global business. It was started by someone on the enterprise allowance scheme in the 1980s, he says.
Cameron says he will be watching banks "like a hawk" to make sure they deliver their promises on lending.
Cameron says tax and regulation are the obstacles to enterprise. The government is cutting corporation tax, and Cameron is doing what he can to get regulators "off the backs of business".
But cutting tax and regulation on its own is not enough.
Cameron cites his patent box plan as an example of how government can help business.
Cameron says he has been "selling Britain to the world".
Some people attacked him when they saw him travelling abroad with business leaders.
• Cameron vows to carry on acting as an international salesman for British business.
Cameron concludes by quoting the two greatest gods in the Conservative pantheon: Churchill and Thatcher. Churchill said "set the people free". And Thatcher said there was almost nothing that the British people could not do.
Cameron has finished now. Was it worth the trip to Cardiff to hear that? Probably yes, actually. For a speech with absolutely no new policy in it at all, it had some strong messages. I'll summarise them in a moment.
Here are the four key messages from David Cameron's speech.
• Cameron presented himself as the international sales director for UK plc. More importantly, he said that this was a job that the prime minister should be doing.
• He insisted that the Conservatives were the natural party of enterprise. All parties have lawyers and lecturers and advisers as MPs, he said.
• He said the budget would be "the most pro-growth budget this country has seen for a generation". • He said he would personally intervene to stop government imposing too many new regulations on business.
In some respects it was very accomplished speech. But it was also rash, and at least one passage was woefully threadbare. In a moment I'll post a short analysis explaining why.
Here are a few more thoughts on David Cameron's speech. • This speech shows that Cameron can turn negative headlines to his advantage - a hugely valuable skill in politics. Earlier (see 11.17am) I quoted from Lord Mandelson's latest comments about Cameron. Cameron displays "skilful political footwork and remarkable confidence when he is in a tight corner", Mandelson said. Today we saw a very good example. Cameron was widely criticised when it emerged that he had taken a planeload of arms salesman with him on the tour of the Middle East that also saw him promoting democracy. Yet today, in rhetorical terms, the strongest passage in his speech was undoubtedly the passage where he vowed to carry on acting as an international salesman. (See 2.51pm.)
• Cameron said (rightly) that business can be moral - but he did not some to acknowledge that business can also be immoral. I'm not sure how much attention this aspect of the speech is going to get in the papers tomorrow, but you can imagine how at some point in the future - perhaps if one if his international arms deals turns ugly - this part of the speech may seem naive.
• Cameron is going to have to come up with some better arguments about the alternative vote if he wants to win the argument. In his speech he used this analogy:
If Cameron carries on like this, he's going to have to hand back that Oxford PPE first. An Olympic final is designed to establish who can run the fastest. An election is designed to establish who can govern with consent.
In his speech Cameron also attacked the "public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small and medium sized companies from a massive potential market". On this basis, he should be in favour of electoral reform. At the moment there is a duopoly in the provision of political leadership in this country. Only two big parties get a look in. Electoral reform would open up the system, and allow new, small and medium-sized parties to enter the market.
• If you want to know how the coalition partners are going to campaign against each other, read this speech. Cameron normally pays tribute to his Lib Dem coalition partners when he delivers a big speech. But today he did not acknoweldge them at all. That's because there are Scottish, Welsh and local elections on the way. By 2014, I guess, all Cameron's speeches will sound a bit like this.
That's it for today. Thanks for all the comments.
