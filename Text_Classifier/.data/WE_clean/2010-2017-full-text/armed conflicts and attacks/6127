Iraq suicide car bombs kill nine
Two suicide car bombs have exploded in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing nine people and wounding 25.
A security official said the cars were queuing to enter the Green Zone when they exploded. Iraqi soldiers were among the casualties.
The heavily fortified Green Zone houses many foreign embassies and Iraqi government offices.
A BBC correspondent in Baghdad says these are the first suicide bombings in the capital this year.
Violence in Iraq has dropped significantly from the height of the insurgency five years ago, but almost daily shootings and killings still continue.
The attacks come amid preparations for an Arab summit in the international zone next month, though this is widely expected to be postponed because of the turmoil in the Arab world.
