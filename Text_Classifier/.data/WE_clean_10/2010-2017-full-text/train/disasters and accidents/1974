Specially trained dogs this evening found three victims, bringing the total to seven fatalities of the explosion, which happened at about 6:15 p.m. Thursday evening near Skyline Boulevard and San Bruno Avenue.
"Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy," San Bruno police Chief Neil Telford said in a statement.
A press conference will be held at 8 a.m. Sunday morning to discuss how displaced residents may return to their homes.
Homes that have been completely destroyed will remain off-limits, while other residents whose houses have sustained moderate damage may only be allowed back to collect some belongings, said City Manager Connie Jackson.
Some residents may be allowed to reoccupy their homes, Jackson said.
