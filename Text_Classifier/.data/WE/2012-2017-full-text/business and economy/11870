EBay in deal with Carl Icahn, names new board member
EBay reported mixed quarterly earnings and revenue on Wednesday and announced plans to cut some 2,400 positions, or about 7 percent of its workforce, as it prepares to split its PayPal and eBay marketplace businesses into two publicly traded companies.
During the company's earnings call, eBay Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said 2015 would present "real challenges" and forecast that "it will get worse before it gets better."
Separately, the company said it entered into an agreement with billionaire activist Carl Icahn, the company's largest active shareholder, and will appoint Jonathan Christodoro, Icahn's pick, to its board.
The company appointed three board members in total, with the other two coming from eBay's nominations.
"Their appointments are the result of significant effort by the nominating committee over the last several months to find talented new directors who will contribute valuable expertise to eBay and PayPal as we create two best-in-class boards," said CEO John Donahoe.
