Istanbul Explosion Kills 10 Tourists, and ISIS Is Blamed
ISTANBUL — On any given day, the heart of this city’s historic district, where the monuments of three empires — Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman — collide with a mix of majesty and tranquillity, is a bustling center of tourism, one of the world’s most visited places.
Mixing among German tourists on Tuesday morning, not far from the celebrated Blue Mosque, the authorities said, was an Islamic State operative from Syria in his late 20s, wearing a vest of explosives and determined to kill as many people as possible.
The attack left 10 tourists dead, all foreigners, and like other terrorist strikes in recent months in Paris; Beirut, Lebanon; Mali; Egypt; and Baghdad, it resonated far beyond Turkey as civilians were again cut down while going about their daily lives.
