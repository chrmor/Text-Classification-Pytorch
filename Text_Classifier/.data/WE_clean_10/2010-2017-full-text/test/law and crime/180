Man removed from Dubai-bound plane at Heathrow
LONDON–British police and airport authorities said Friday there was a security incident aboard an Emirates passenger jet at London's Heathrow Airport. Witnesses said at least one passenger was removed from the plane.
A spokesman for Heathrow said police were called to the jet, which was preparing to fly to Dubai.
Witnesses told television channel Sky News that armed police officers boarded the plane bound and arrested a man.
"Basically the police just swarmed the guy and rushed him out," passenger Cameron Mclean told Sky News by phone. "We've been told not to stand up. ... We're going to be moved to a safe place."
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were aware of an incident, but provided no details.
The Heathrow spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with policy, said no passenger was harmed and that the airport – Europe's busiest – remained open. He declined to provide further details.
