Christchurch loses World Cup hosting rights
Earthquake-ravaged Christchurch has lost its rights to host seven Rugby World Cup games.
New Zealand Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully made the announcement this afternoon.
McCully said the two quarter-final matches would go to Auckland and five the pool matches would be divided between other venues. He hoped some of these would remain in the South Island.
Australia were due to be based in Christchurch for the pool stage of the tournament and were scheduled to face to Italy and Russia in the quake-hit city.
No decision has yet been made as to where the Wallabies will be based but Auckland is the early favourite.
