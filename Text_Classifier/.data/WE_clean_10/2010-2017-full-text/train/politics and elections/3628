Official, final tally: Jokowi 53.15%, Prabowo 46.85%
Joko "Jokowi" Widodo, is officially Indonesia's seventh president after the General Elections Commission (KPU) concluded its vote recapitulation on Tuesday evening, confirming that the governor of Jakarta and furniture businessman had garnered 53.15 percent of the vote.
Jokowi netted 70,633,576 votes, which was over 8 million more than rival Prabowo Subianto, who received 62,262,844 votes or 46.85 percent.
Analysts have said that with a gap of 6.3 percent, it would be difficult for Prabowo to contest the result with the Constitutional Court.
Jokowi will be sworn in as president no later than Oct. 20.
Prabowo had earlier rejected the election vote recapitulation process and result, claiming that the election process was flawed and marred by widespread fraud. (ren)
