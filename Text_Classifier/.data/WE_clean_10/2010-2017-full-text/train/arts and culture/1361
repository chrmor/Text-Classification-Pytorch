Daft Punk get lucky at Grammy Awards
French dance duo Daft Punk have taken top honours at the Grammy Awards, winning five prizes including album and record of the year.
Hip-hop duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis took four awards - best new artist plus best rap album, song and performance.
Justin Timberlake won three, while New Zealand teenager Lorde picked up two including song of the year for Royals.
Sir Paul McCartney was among the other double winners and also reunited with his Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr.
The pair teamed up for Sir Paul's song Queenie Eye during the ceremony, which is known for its heavyweight on-stage collaborations.
The show was opened by Jay-Z and his wife Beyonce, while Madonna joined Macklemore and Lewis during their anti-homophobia anthem Same Love, as 33 same-sex and heterosexual couples got married on stage.
Other collaborations included Metallica performing with pianist Lang Lang and Daft Punk, Nile Rodgers and Pharrell Williams being joined by Stevie Wonder to perform Get Lucky.
The dance pioneers, real names Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, never appear in public without their trademark robot helmets.
Get Lucky, which featured producer and singer Pharrell and disco guitarist and producer Rodgers, was one of the biggest hits of 2013.
As well as scooping album and record of the year, Daft Punk won best pop duo/group performance for Get Lucky and best dance/electronica album for Random Access Memories.
The album was also named best engineered album, non-classical, which was credited to its engineers.
So they left the acceptance speeches to their collaborators. "Well, I suppose the robots would like to thank..." joked Pharrell, who also won non-classical producer of the year.
"You know honestly, I bet France is really proud of these guys right now."
As well as performing, Sir Paul McCartney picked up the trophies for best music film and best rock song for Cut Me Some Slack, a collaboration with the surviving members of Nirvana.
It beat The Rolling Stones' Doom And Gloom, from their 50th anniversary album GRRR!, as well as tracks by veteran metal band Black Sabbath, stadium rockers Muse and US singer-guitarist Gary Clark Jr.
Black Sabbath did scoop best metal performance, while Led Zeppelin won best rock album for their live recording Celebration Day.
Other British nominees included Ed Sheeran and James Blake, who were both up for best new artist, but lost out to Macklemore and Lewis.
Rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis, who found fame after self-releasing their album The Heist, won four awards from seven nominations.
"We made this album without a record label, we made it independently and we appreciate all the support," Macklemore told the audience.
Seventeen-year-old Lorde's debut single Royals earned song of the year and best pop solo performance after catapulting her to the top of the charts around the world last year.
Jay-Z started the night with the most nominations, up for nine awards. He won best rap/sung collaboration for Holy Grail, featuring Justin Timberlake.
Timberlake, Pharrell and rapper Kendrick Lamar were among the acts who went into the ceremony with seven nominations.
Other winners included Adele for her James Bond theme Skyfall, which won the prize for best song written for visual media, and Scottish percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, who won best classical instrumental solo.
British hitmaker Calvin Harris was up for best dance/electronica album for 18 Months and best dance recording for Sweet Nothing with Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch, but lost out on both.
UK acts Duke Dumont and Disclosure were also unsuccessful nominees in the dance categories.
David Bowie had been nominated for best rock album and best rock performance for his 2013 comeback, but missed out in both categories.
The awards can be seen on Monday 27 January at 9pm on 4Music.
