A CONSTANT stream of mourners has been attending the home of sporting legend Paidi O Se in Ventry where he is lying in repose.
Among them was Arts Minister Jimmy Deenihan who played alongside O Se for Kerry, retired GAA commentator Micheal O Muircheartaigh and former Cork player and manager Larry Tomkins.
Paidi died suddenly at home on Saturday morning of a suspected heart attack. He was 57.
Sports Minister Jimmy Deenihan spoke of his shock on hearing of the death of his friend and former teammate.
“It’s just so hard to comprehend,” he said. “He was such a larger than life figure it’s hard to understand how he could have been taken so soon.
“Paidi was universally loved and very inoffensive and he was very much a one off.”
Other well-known faces in attendance included former tanaiste Dick Spring and his nephew, Kerry North-West Limerick TD, Arthur Spring, former Fianna Fail MEP Gerry Collins, and Kerry footballer Darran O’Sullivan.
Kerry County Council also paid tribute to the eight times All-Ireland winner at its monthly meeting where a minute’s silence was observed.
Mayor of Kerry Terry O’Brien said he was a larger than life character who made a huge contribution to his native county.
“He was hugely generous with his time, made friend and stranger feel welcome and was known wherever he went around the globe,” he said.
