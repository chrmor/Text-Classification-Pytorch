Trump agree with South Korea Moon on revising bilateral missile treaty
SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump agreed with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to revise the two countries’ treaty capping the development of the South’s ballistic missiles as Seoul has hoped to, Moon’s office said on Saturday.
South Korea’s development of its ballistic missiles is limited to range of 800 kilometers (500 miles) and payload weight of 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) under a bilateral treaty revised in 2012.
The two leaders discussed the issue as a way to boost the South’s defense against growing threat from North in a telephone call, South Korea’s Blue House said.
