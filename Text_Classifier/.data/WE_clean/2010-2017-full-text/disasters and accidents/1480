A pilot was killed in a mid-air collision during an air show of retro planes in southern Germany, Die Welt reported.
Two planes collided on Saturday afternoon at an airfield near the city of Warngau, some 40 km south of Munich.
One of the planes remained airborne and its pilot managed to perform an emergency landing, while the second aircraft crashed immediately and caught fire.
Organizers cancelled the second day of the show, involving 82 retro aircraft, due to be held on Sunday.
The accident comes about two weeks after an incident near the German city of Nuremberg. A woman was killed and 38 people injured when an aircraft swerved from the runway during takeoff and ploughed into a crowd of spectators.
