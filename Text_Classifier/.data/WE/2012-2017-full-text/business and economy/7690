US Federal Reserve holds off on 'tapering'
The Federal Reserve has left its $US85 billion ($91 billion) a month stimulus program in place, against broad expectations that it would reduce it as the economy grows.
Fed policy makers instead cut their growth forecast for this year and next, suggesting the economy is feeling the impact of government spending cuts and continues to struggle to break free from the Great Recession.
‘‘Conditions in the job market today are still far from what all of us would like to see,’’ chairman Ben Bernanke said at a press conference after the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. ‘‘The committee has concern that rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months would have the effect of slowing growth.’’
The move provoked Wall Street to hit record highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 172.09 points or 1.11 per cent, to 15,701.82, the S&P 500 gaining 23.71 points or 1.39 per cent, to 1,728.47 and the Nasdaq adding 41.207 points or 1.1 per cent, to 3,786.906.
