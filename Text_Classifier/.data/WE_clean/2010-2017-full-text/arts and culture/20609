Madonna falls off stage during Living For Love performance
When you're singing a song that includes the lyric "watch me stumble", the last thing you want is for life to imitate art.
But life did indeed imitate art when the 56-year-old music icon Madonna tumbled down a staircase due to a wardrobe malfunction during her live performance at the Brit Awards in London.
Performing her new single Living For Love and surrounded by dancers, Madonna was shrouded in a cape which, once unfastened, was to be removed by one of the dancers.
But as Madonna fumbled with the lacing around her neck, one of the dancers yanked on it while it was still attached.
