workers trapped as blast rips through mine
IT WAS the phone call every mining executive must dread. An explosion had ripped through the Pike River coalmine in Atarau, New Zealand. Management had lost contact with dozens of workers still underground.
Peter Whittall, the Australian chief executive of Pike River Coal Mine, knows all his staff personally after recruiting each one. He was extremely concerned for the men who had not yet come out. ''Not having communication with them is very distressing,'' he said.
Mr Whittall was flying to Christchurch last night and was expected to arrive at the mine, 50 kilometres north-east of Greymouth, early this morning.
He said the rescue effort to save the 27 trapped miners was likely to continue throughout the night. It's believed Austalian and British nationals are among those missing.
''The men are between two and 2Â½ kilometres inside, but because the mine drills into the side of the mountain they are probably only 120 metres below the surface.''
