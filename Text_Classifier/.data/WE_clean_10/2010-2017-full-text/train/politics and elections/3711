Nearly 80 per cent of Egyptians have voted in favour of constitutional amendments that pave the way for democratic elections for a new parliament and president within six months.
More than 18 million voters - or 41 per cent of those eligible - turned out in a referendum on constitutional reforms one month after former president Hosni Mubarak and his regime were ousted from power.
Mr Mubarak, ousted by a popular uprising on February 11, had ruled for three decades.
One of the changes prevents a president serving more than eight years, making Egypt one of few Arab republics to set such a restriction.
The amendments would also force a president to appoint a deputy within 30 days.
For most Egyptians the referendum was the first truly free vote they have had in their lives.
The referendum divided Egyptians between those who said the reforms would suffice and others who said the constitution needed a complete rewrite - something that will happen after the legislative elections.
Turnout was always very low for elections which were routinely rigged under Mr Mubarak.
The amendments were drawn up by a judicial panel appointed by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.
The military says it wants to relinquish authority to an elected government as quickly as possible.
The changes were backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the main Islamist group and one of the forces that mobilised against Mr Mubarak, and remnants of the former president's National Democratic Party.
But some pro-democracy activists say the reforms do not go far enough to overhaul Egypt's presidential powers.
