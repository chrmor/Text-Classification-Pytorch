Nairo Quintana resists Chris Froome challenge to win Vuelta a España
Colombian adds crown to his victory in the 2014 Giro d’Italia Tour de France winner came second with Esteban Chaves third
Nairo Quintana won the Vuelta a España on Sunday, adding the title to the 2014 Giro d’Italia on his Grand Tour list of honours.
The Movistar climbing expert had cemented his commanding lead over Team Sky’s Chris Froome in Saturday’s decisive mountain stage.
Following custom, Froome did not challenge Quintana on the traditional ride into the Spanish capital on the 21st and final stage. The Colombian finished 1min 23sec in front of the Tour de France winner.
“It’s been tough, I won’t lie, especially on the back of the Tour de France and then going to Rio for the road race and time trial at the Olympics,” Froome told Eurosport. “Coming here, it means I haven’t had much time at home for the last three months. I’ve had a lot time away from the family.”
Quintana completed the gruelling three-week race that covered 3,315.5km in 83hr 31min 28sec.
Esteban Chaves finished in third place and more than four minutes off the pace. He was followed by the three-times Vuelta winner Alberto Contador in fourth.
“I woke up this morning feeling like the winner but I couldn’t raise my arms in celebration until I crossed the finish line,” Quintana said. “This is probably the most important win for me, considering the scenario and who I was racing against. Froome is a great rival.”
Magnus Cort Nielsen of Denmark won the flat 105km ride starting in Las Rozas before making loops through Madrid’s centre. It was his second stage win of this race.
At 26 Quintana has established himself as one of the top riders in the world and the main rival to the three-times Tour de France winner Froome. Quintana has twice finished runner-up to Froome at the Tour, most recently in July when he could not mount a serious challenge to the dominant Sky team.
Froome finished second at the Vuelta for a third time, after also coming close in 2011 and 2014. “Nairo was great this Vuelta. Team Movistar was great this Vuelta ... they really rode well and deserve the victory,” Froome said.
Quintana, who became the second Colombian to win this race after Luis Herrera in 1987, said winning the Tour remained his main goal. “It’s a dream that is still with me and I hope one day I can make it come true,” he said. “I will keep working toward it.”
