at least 16 dead as bus carrying Hungarian students bursts into flames near Verona
Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister, told a news conference that the teenagers were from a secondary school in Budapest, returning from their annual ski camp in France. He said there was uncertainty over the exact number of passengers on the bus, but it was higher than the director of the school had been aware of.
Mr Szijjarto said one seriously injured passenger was being kept in a coma. The minister said that 12 passengers were “well” and staying in a hotel in the southern part of Verona.
Girolamo Lacquaniti, the highway police chief for the area, said: “We are not aware of other vehicles being involved, it seems to have gone off the road of its own accord.”
Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, said: “With my prayers, I am with the families and friends shocked by the tragedy.”
Italian media said the bus had been carrying students aged between 14 and 18, when it was involved in an accident on a motorway near the city of Verona.
The fire service said on Twitter that the bus had burst into flames. "There are many victims," it said.
