Cyclone Lam: Indigenous communities evacuated as category three storm intensifies
Schools and even a mechanical workshop have become temporary cyclone shelters in remote Indigenous communities ahead of the arrival of the category three Cyclone Lam, which is strengthening off the coast of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) expects the cyclone, which is gusting at 165kph, to intensify as it moves slowly parallel to the coast, and then make landfall on Friday morning. At 11:00pm (CST) on Wednesday, the cyclone was about 165 kilometres north-north-east of Elcho Island and 165 kilometres north-north-west of Nhulunbuy, about 600km east of Darwin. It was moving north-west at around 6 kph, and was expected to start moving south-west towards the coast during Thursday. Residents of Nhulunbuy, Elcho Island and Gapuwiyak have been advised to immediately find shelter. Coastal residents between Millingimbi and Nhulunbuy have been warned a storm tide will cause flooding. Residents on Elcho Island were sheltering in a school hall and mechanical workshop in Galiwin'ku, in the south of the island, while northern communities such as Gawa had been evacuated. "Gawa's the first northern point on the island so the roads are sort of flooded all the way up to there at the moment," Elcho Island resident Ewen Nettleton said. "There's pretty limited access. The town itself, people are starting to move into the shelter at the school. "There's about a hundred people up there now and everyone else is filling up with fuel and stocking up with groceries." In far east Arnhem Land, staff at the Gapuwiyak Culture and Arts centre were trying to protect irreplaceable Aboriginal artefacts ahead of the weather. "We've got a collection here of woven artefacts so they've been put into a cabinet and locked up, some of the larger carvings that are in the collection we've wrapped in plastic ... basically just in case the roof goes," manager Leon Stainer said. "I mean the stock can be replaced or is covered by insurance but this stuff is a special collection." West of Gapuwiyak, on the coast and in the path of Lam, manager of the One-Six-Eight general store Terry Chiang said people had stocked up. "It looks like very busy today, everybody is coming to do shopping ... yeah, today the business is better than the normal day," he said. Wind gusts over 170kph expected: BoM A category three cyclone is powerful enough to cause roof and structural damage to homes, with power failures likely and some caravans destroyed. On Wednesday night the BoM said destructive winds with gusts greater than 170 kilometres per hour would likely continue the Wessel islands overnight, and were expected to extend onto the mainland coast between Milingimbi and Gapuwiyak late on Thursday. "Very destructive winds may extend further east towards Nhulunbuy overnight Thursday and into early Friday if the cyclone takes a more southward track," it said. "Winds with gusts to 130 kilometres per hour should develop about the mainland coast between Maningrida and Nhulunbuy during Thursday before possibly extending over adjacent inland areas on Friday. "Gales with gusts to 110 kilometres per hour may develop in coastal areas between Elcho Island and Nhulunbuy overnight or during early Thursday before possibly extending to Goulburn Island and Cape Shield and over adjacent inland areas during Thursday. "Gales may extend further west to Croker Island or south to Port Roper and over inland areas towards Bulman and Gunbalanya on Friday depending on the track the cyclone takes." Storm surge danger The BoM warned coastal residents tides would rise significantly above the normal high mark, with damaging waves and very dangerous flooding. "If you do have accommodation constructed to the Building Code or are unsure of your present accommodation you should proceed immediately to shelter with family, friends, or one of the local emergency shelters," it said. At 11:00pm on Wednesday the warning zone, in which gales are expected within 24 hours, included Goulburn Island to Cape Shield, including Nhulunbuy. The watch zone, in which gales are expected within 24 to 48 hours, included Croker Island to Goulburn Island and Cape Shield to Port Roper, including Groote Eylandt. Cape Shield to Alyangula, including Groote Eylandt were no longer under warning, but remained under watch status. - ABC Â© ABC 2015
