Tunisia Defense Ministry: Soldier killed after opening fire on fellow troops at Tunis barracks
Tunisia's Defense Ministry says a Tunisian soldier has been killed after opening fire on fellow troops at military barracks in the capital Tunis.
Ministry spokesman Belhassen Oueslati said it was not immediately clear whether there were other casualties in Monday's shooting at the Bouchoucha barracks, near the National Bardo Museum where 22 people — mostly tourists — were killed in a terror attack on March 18.
It wasn't immediately clear what motivated the soldier.
Since overthrowing its secular dictator in in 2011, Tunisia has been battling militant groups with links to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, which have carried out attacks on security forces.
