(The Telegraph)","sport","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/frenchopen/10883337/Maria-Sharapova-v-Simona-Halep-French-Open-2014-womens-final-live.html","Maria Sharapova v Simona Halep, French Open 2014 women's final: live
WRAP: For all the talk of this being Halep's first ever grand slam final, the Romanian looked at home on the big stage and against a lesser opponent would've picked up a maiden major title today. But Sharapova raised her level when she needed too, outmuscling and outpowering her opponent despite suffering with her service game and gifting the No 4 seed a number of points with her high number of double faults. It was the women's final the Parisians craved, one that went the distance for the first time since 2001 when Halep managed to dig deep in the second set tie-break with Sharapova two points from clinching the match in straight sets. Despite Sharapova's superior experience of finals, the match continued to ebb and flow in the third. A crucial hold in the fourth game looked to give Sharapova the edge only for Halep to break back for 4-all. With the chips down this past fortnight, Sharapova has showed her resolve, and she did it again here, breaking straight back and comfortably holding at the death to wrap up a match which lasted over three hours. Thanks for joining us today, please come back tomorrow as we bring you coverage of Novak Djokovic against Rafael Nadal.
""I never thought seven, eight years ago that I would win more Roland Garros titles than anywhere else. I'm so emotional right now, I can't even talk.""
Sharapova* 6-4, 6-7, 6-4 Halep A fifth straight point for Sharapova puts her closer to her fifth grand slam title. Make that six as she volleys home and Halep drags the next return into the tramlines. It's three match points for Sharapova, and she only needs one as she drills a deep forehand into the corner. Halep gets on the end of it, but she lifts it high and it lands wide. SHARAPOVA BEATS HALEP TO WIN FRENCH OPEN.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7, 5-4 Halep* Sharpova is pinned to the baseline again but this time manages to claw a forehand from behind her and load it with enough topspin that moves it out of Halep's reach as she races to three break points. She manages to get enough on a first serve return which Halep manages to retrieve but Sharapova picks up the short ball and dispatches it to leave her serving for the match and a second French Open title. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 6-4, 6-7, 4-4 Halep Jekyll and Hyde from Sharapova again on her serve with a double fault on the second point followed by a third ace to bring the game all square at 30-all. Another great defence from Halep keeps Sharapova behind the baseline. The Russian thinks she's spotted an opening and tries to edge to the net, but Halep fires a deep return and Sharapova can't get the ball out from under her feet and it's another break point shot to the Romanian. Another double from Sharapova and Halep has a break back, all too easily again. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7, 4-3 Halep* At 30-all Sharapova goes for a big winner but her forehand hits the tape and this time she doesn't get a lucky bounce. Halep comfortably takes the next two points and the pressure is back on Sharapova.
Sharapova* 6-4, 6-7, 4-2 Halep That break has given Sharapova an extra lift and she bulldozes her way to three successive points for three game points. When Sharapova has been on her game today, Halep has been outpowered. It's an easy hold as Sharapova leaps on a short return and the focus and momentum is back with the 2012 champ.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7, 3-2 Halep* Halep is caught cold again at the start of her service game and slow to react to one return as Sharapova steals a march at 30-0 and then makes it three break points with some great defensive play. The pair exchange a series of backhands on the next before Sharapova's forehand misfires and Halep saves one break. A second is saved, but she can't survive a third as she slaps the ball into the bottom of the net. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 6-4, 6-7, 2-2 Halep A series of first serves is just the tonic for the former world No 1 who attempts to shorten the rallies and deny her busy and ever-efficient opponent a look in. It appears to be paying off as she moves to 40-15 but she's pegged back to 40-all when she can't get up and over a regulation backhand and the nerves start to settle in again. Her trusty friend the net cord comes to her aid as Halep watches as her return lands back in her half, but luckily she's given another shot at deuce when Sharapova gets her court dimensions slightly off again. A third deuce later and Halep whallops a volley home and manages to stop herself from sliding into the net to bring up a second break point. Sharapova saves the day again with a forehand return which stops dead, leaving Halep unable to get underneath it as the game moves past seven minutes. A strong first serve which kicks up and throws Halep off allows Sharapova time to breathe a sigh of relief again and she finally secures a vital hold when she gets on top of the next rally and forces Halep to hit wide. Sharapova looks to her corner shaking both fists, boy did she like that.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7, 1-2 Halep* Sharapova is trying to outmuscle her way past Halep but the Romanian just won't lie down. Halep hangs in one rally but Sharapova finally wears her opponent down to edge 30-15 up. Halep is level when she has time to load a forehand with spin and sends it spining out of Sharapova's reach. And it's soon game point when Sharapova finds the tramlines while leaning back again. Halep bides her time on the next, advancing to mid court to execute another perfect forehand which the outstretched Sharapova takes a swing at but misses.
Sharapova* 6-4, 6-7, 1-1 Halep Sharapova looks more dangerous when she hasn't got to serve. Two more double faults and Halep is handed a 30-15 advantage. It's two break points when Sharapova stumbles into a backhand and crashes the ball into the net. Sharapova thinks she's done enough when she punches one forehand into the corner, but Halep gets enough on the return and when the Russian attempts a drop shot, it drifts wide and Halep has the break back. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7, 1-0 Halep* After a lengthy, lengthy toilet break from Sharapova which Halep spent sheltering under an umbrella and mildly jogging on the spot, the third and final set is finally underway. The break has done Sharapova wonders, she has a spring back in her step and has soon forgotten that missed chance in the tie-break at 5-3 up as she moves to two break points. She works Halep from side-to-side and forces her to go long and the break is hers. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Ben Rothenberg - Sharapova has won her last 19 straight three-setters on clay. Halep has won 10 of her last 11. The one loss was to Sharapova. &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23RG14"" target=""_blank""&gt;#RG14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
Sharapova 6-4, 6-7 Halep TIE-BREAK: A nervous forehand from Sharapova puts her two points from a second Roland Garros title but she stutters with her service game on the next point, taking an age at the ball toss and it costs her as she drags a forehand into the tramlines after Halep jumps on a slow serve. Halep just won't be beaten and makes Sharapova work for every point and forces her to overhit another forehand for 5-5. And it's quickly 6-5 and set point Halep when Sharapova makes another error. Sharapova struggles with her ball tossing some more and hits into the tramlines on the return, handing Halep the set. HALEP WINS TIE-BREAK TO TAKE MATCH INTO DECIDER.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-6 Halep TIE-BREAK: Sharapova edges back in front for 3-2 when Halep can't get enough lift on another return, and then sneaks a 4-2 advantage for the changeover. Over two hours now and the clock and Sharapova is pulled back to 4-3 when she pushes a forehand just inches over the baseline.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-6 Halep TIE-BREAK: Halep absorbs some more Sharapova power for a mini-break but slaps into the net on the next point and then can't get her racket head over a quick-fire return from Sharapova on the next to trail 2-1.
Sharapova 6-4, 6-6 Halep* My oh my how this match is fluctuating now as Sharapova races to three break points. The clear sound of a string pinging mid rally puts Halep off as Sharapova wraps up the break when the Russian fires a volley straight into her opponent's feet and Halep can't retrieve the ball. She heads over to her corner to fix her racket before preparing for the tie-break.
Sharapova* 6-4, 5-6 Halep Sharapova turns up her grunting levels again as she slips a mini-break down, she tries to force the issue on the next, injecting some pace, but Halep is equal to it, comes to the net when the chance presents itself and dispatches a volley for three break points. Sharapova sees off the first with a strong first serve down the T, and then forces Halep to hit long with an outswinging first serve. She can't prevent a third as, leaning back, she sends her return long, well beyond the baseline and Halep is serving for the set again. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 6-4, 5-5 Halep* It's a nervous opening as Halep puts too much power on one return and is then out-manoevred on the next point. Halep attacks on the next to hang in the game but she can't quite control a deep forehand return from Sharapova and is staring at two break points. Sharapova hasn't been able to convert many of her break points today but gets a huge, huge slice of luck with one break point saved as the ball clips the tape and lands close to Halep's side of the net. That's touch on the Romanian. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 6-4, 4-5 Halep Halep digs deep to get back from 30-down, but Sharapova is giving it everything now and moves to two game points. The good and bad side of Sharapova's game are evident as a 30th unforced error brings Halep back to 40-30 and it's quickly deuce as Halep makes Sharapova play one more point. A fantastic rally ensues at deuce, probably the best of the match as both players match each other punch for punch and forehand for forehand. Sharapova looks to have worked her way into a point-winning position, but Halep pushes one return deep and Sharapova hits tamely into the net. The break is Halep's when Sharapova drags her next return into the tramlines and she'll be serving to square the match. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 6-4, 4-4 Halep* Halep loves to strike her groundstrokes early and it pays off, catching Sharapova cold and forcing her to hit long. Halep mixes it up on the next with a drop shot and then curling a passing winner round and behind Sharapova who is an imposing figure at the net. Sharapova drags Halep back to 30-all by working Halep's forehand and then punching a forehand into the advantage court and catching the Romanian out. And a third successive point brings up a break point but Halep sees off the danger when she rushes to net and dances into a forehand. In a flash, Sharapova is back all over Halep, carving out a second break point - but again Halep pushes a backhand deep into the corner. A couple of strong first serves later and Halep survives.
Sharapova* 6-4, 4-3 Halep What's this from Sharapova. An ace? Wow. That's a rarity this match. It sets her up nicely for 30-0, which soon becomes 40-0 when Halep can't get enough lift on a return. A strong first serve looks to set the game up nicely for Sharapova, but Halep isn't going to roll over and makes Sharapova play one more point and the Russian cracks. Sharapova didn't enjoy being given the runaround and gives Halep a taste of her own medicine as she wraps up another important hold.
Sharapova 6-4, 3-3 Halep* Halep is doing just about enough to keep in touch, but you just feel that Sharapova won't be far away from raising her game again. Halep is brought back to 30-15 when the umpires stretches his legs to check on one overhit return. But the No 4 seed levels when she catches a return on the half volley and the ball skims the line.
Sharapova* 6-4, 3-2 Halep It's all a little too loud for Sharapova who has a word with the umpire to tell the unruly fans off. The crowd is deadly silent, though, as she delivers back-to-back double faults and Halep has another mini-break. Sharapova gets back into the swing of things with a forehand winner and pulls level when Halep overeggs a return. Sharapova, her dusty pink and orange dress soaked in sweat, takes control of proceedings by coming to net and seeing off her rival. A fourth double fault this set gives Halep hope at deuce, but when her opponent slaps the net failing to return, Sharapova squats and lets out a 'come on' which turns into an even bigger 'come on' when Halep can't stay in the next rally.
Sharapova 6-4, 2-2 Halep* Halep has been let off the hook here by Sharapova as her concentration levels have taken a drastic dip and Halep surges to 40-0. The crowd find their voice and help to spur the young Romanian on. Halep does her best to respond but can't get across to make one return but thankfully Sharapova over hits on the next and the set remains level.
Sharapova* 6-4, 2-1 Halep Sharapova suffers the service yips again, a fifth double fault handing a mini-break to Halep. Halep appears to give up on the next rally, but swings and hits a forehand which is too good for Sharapova. Despite having the luxury of two break points, she has the break back when Sharapova hits wide. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 6-4, 2-0 Halep* Halep still has a spring left in her step but at 30-15, Sharapova's class is telling as she works Halep from side-to-side and opens up just the slightest of windows to send a forehand fizzing past Halep again and the Romanian can't chase it down despite her best efforts. Great movement around the court again from Sharapova brings her back to deuce as her power and precision is proving just too good for Halep. A loose shot from Halep gives Sharapova break point, but Halep averts the danger, whipping a forehand winner deep in the corner. Sharapova bullies her way to a second break point, but Halep keeps her head again to force her opponent into an error. A second double fault of the match gifts Sharapova break point No 3 and after hitting a first serve wide, she hits the next return into the tramlines and an early break goes to the 2012 champion. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 6-4, 1-0 Halep An hour on the clock and Sharapova's service game picks up, a couple of first serves helping her charge before a forehand across court brings up 40-0. A backhand return on the next point proves too strong for Halep and it will be interesting to see if Halep can respond here, or if the big occasion will swallow her up.
Sharapova 6-4 Halep* Now it's Halep's turn to suffer with her first serves and the nerves are setting in - she is, after all, yet to drop a set these championships. Halep manages to peg Sharapova back to 30-all but the Russian sets up a first set point when she moves Halep from side to side and forces her rival to attempt a lob which lands outside the baseline. Halep survives, rushing the net and dispatching a short return. She's staring at a second set point down when Sharapova leaps on a second serve and this time she wraps it up when Halep hits wide. SHARAPOVA BREAKS AND WINS FIRST SET
Sharapova* 5-4 Halep For all Sharapova's experience of the big occasions, she still struggles when it comes to the big points and big moments. Halep jumps on her insecurities and races to two break points. She can't convert the first, but when Sharapova gets her footwork wrong on the next and fires into the tramlines, the set is still alive. HALEP BREAKS.
Sharapova 5-3 Halep* Halep takes advantage of the new balls, whipping a forehand back loaded with top spin on her way to charging to 40-0. She wraps it up in a flash and now Sharapova serves for the set.
Sharapova* 5-2 Halep Sharapova has been slow to get going her past three matches heading into the final and while she's starting to build momentum and focus, her first serve remains her flaw. The stop-start nature of her service game seems to be upsetting Halep's concentration levels and a lucky net cord hasn't helped as Sharapova moves to 30-15. Some more heavy groundstrokes from Sharapova, and she's edging closer to the opening set.
Sharapova 4-2 Halep* Sharapova produces one of the shots of the match with Halep exerting the pressure on the net as she lobs from the baseline and has the No 4 seed scampering back but without a hope. She races to two break points and takes it on the first with a classy backhand winner down the line. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 3-2 Halep Sharapova has a little mutter to herself in her corner after losing the opening point and her little pep talk does the trick as she works the angles, advances to net and puts the ball into the empty half with Halep still puffing from chasing the last return down. Halep starts to join in with Sharapova's grunting now as she starts to feel the pace of these rallies. But after one deuce, Halep stays toe-to-toe with Sharapova to force a second. A third double-fault gifts the Romanian a look at a break. But Sharapova responds in the best way possible, slamming home a stupendous forehand which lands flush on the line. Sharapova lifts both arms to the sky as she whips a backhand winner home on the next but an air-shot at the baseline on the next not only leaves her red-faced but brings up a fourth deuce. A slight slip from Halep and an overhit return see Sharapova edge in front for the first time in the final.
Sharapova 2-2 Halep* At 15-all both players use the width of the court, pulling each other from side-to-side along the baseline but it's Sharapova that can't keep a backhand in. Sharapova makes amends on the next, sending down an inch-perfect forehand which skids off the baseline and when she sends down a second successive fizzing forehand, she brings up a first break point. Halep isn't having any of it, catching Sharapova out with an injection of pace on a backhand which sets up her winning forehand. She's forced to save a second, and does so when she steps into a short return and pushes a classy winner past Sharapova's outstretched racket. Halep mixes it up on the next with her first attempt at a drop shot, but it's not executed well and Sharapova leaps on it for a third break point. With the game approaching seven minutes, Sharapova works the line perfectly again for break point No 4. And when Halep spins one backhand wide, the break is back. SHARAPOVA BREAKS.
Sharapova* 1-2 Halep Sharapova's service game has yet to get going and a second double fault brings up 15-all. Luckily she's starting to find her range on the forehand side and chases down a return to fizz one inside the line which has Halep beaten. At 30-all, Halep thinks about going on the attack and coming to net, but thinks twice, retreats and it costs her dear as Sharapova take control and hits another forehand winner for game point. Halep digs deep on the next point and this time charges the net, but Sharapova holds firm to get a first game on the board.
Sharapova 0-2 Halep* Halep's corner are all donned in red 'Allez Halep' T-shirts and look quite an imposing bunch on Chatrier. Her cheer squad are helping her calm her nerves from the off as errors from Sharapova continue to hand the Romanian free points. Sharapova pegs Halep back to 30-all when she puts away a volley in the empty half of the court after Halep retrieved a strong forehand. But Halep keeps Sharapova pinned behind the baseline to take the next point. After being pulled back to deuce, Halep works Sharapova left and right before finding room to float a backhand winner down the line. She wraps up a two-game cushion when she jumps on a short service return.
Sharapova* 0-1 Halep (*denotes next to serve) Sharapova opens up strongly punching away a forehand after a second serve for the opening point but Halep steals an early march when Sharapova hits long and wide on the next two. Halep can't get enough lift and spin to sneak an early break point shot but still has a fighting chance of something from this opening game when Sharapova double-faults for deuce. Halep brings up a first break point when Sharapova goes long and a second successive unforced error hands her rival the game. HALEP BREAKS.
14.10 Players are just finalising their warm-ups and we'll be go, go, go...
14.05 Conditions are good in Paris today. It's not looking so good for the men's final tomorrow with our thunderstorms heading over the Channel later tonight.
13.58 Here come the players onto Philippe Chatrier court, Sharapova strolling out with no sign of nerves given this is her ninth slam final. Halep looks slightly tense as he bounces up and down on the red stuff awaiting the umpire's coin toss.
13.50 Reaching a first slam final and letting her tennis on the court do the talking might finally put to bed one of the main talking points surrounding Halep - how a breast reduction has improved her game.
Halep underwent surgery five years ago when she was 17 and said at the time of the operation: ""I don’t like them in my everyday life, either. I would have gone for surgery even if I hadn’t been a sportswoman”.
Halep's tennis coach Wim Fissette said: “I did not know her then, but I have seen some photos. She took that decision and it was a good one. I understand that it’s what a lot of people know her for: in the Belgian newspapers it is same thing. But let’s hope she will win a grand slam and then they will start talking about that instead.”
13.45 Reigning Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli believes Sharapova has the edge today against grand slam debutant Halep.
“Because she struggled so much during those last three matches, I favour Maria to find a way to win,” Bartoli said.
“I think she can carry on this momentum. Especially in that third set against Bouchard, she played really well. And Simona will not play like Bouchard, stepping inside the court and trying to fire winners. So I think Maria will feel less pressed by her opponent. She will have more time and that will help her to feel more relaxed.”
13.30 Sharapova's route to the final has been a story of fighting until the death having lost the opening set of her last three matches and coming within a handful of points of being knocked out. Judy Murray tweeted after her comeback win over Spaniard Garbine Muguruza (Serena Williams's conqueror) that: ""Sharapova is like a tea bag. Put her into hot water and you'll find out how strong she is"", to which a bamboozled Sharapova replied: ""I'm sorry, but I don't know who she is"".
First Round - def. Ksenia Pervak, 6-1, 6-2. Second Round - def. Tsvetana Pironkova, 7-5, 6-2. Third Round - def. Paula Ormaechea, 6-0, 6-0. Fourth Round - def. Sam Stosur (19), 3-6, 6-4, 6-0. Quarter-finals - def. Garbine Muguruza, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1. Semi-finals - def. Eugenie Bouchard (18), 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.
13.15 If it wasn't for Halep it could be our very own Heather Watson lining up in today's final. Ok, ok, that might be stretching it. Watson was beaten in the second round by the No 4 seed but managed to take six games off her - two more than that of Svetlana Kuznetsova in the last eight. Only Andrea Petkovic has come close to taking a set off the Romanian though.
First Round - def. Alisa Kleybanova, 6-0, 6-2. Second Round - def. Heather Watson, 6-2, 6-4. Third Round - def. Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor, 6-3, 6-0. Fourth Round - def. Sloane Stephens (15), 6-4, 6-3. Quarter-finals - def. Svetlana Kuznetsova (27), 6-2, 6-2. Semi-finals - def. Andrea Petkovic (28), 6-2, 7-6 (4).
13.00 Afternoon tennis fans. While one man dominates the red stuff in Paris and looks set to extend his reign as King of Roland Garros on Sunday, the women's title has been somewhat of a hot potato with Halep potentially becoming the eighth different winner in eight years.
Since Justine Henin won a third successive French Open title in 2007, the title has been shared among a number of players floating in and around the top 10 and incredibly, the last time the final went the distance was back in 2001 when Jennifer Capriati beat Kim Clijsters 12-10 in the decider.
Here's the full list of previous champions from the last seven years. Will Sharapova buck the trend and scoop a second Coupe Suzanne Lenglen?
10.45 Morning all. It's women's final day at Roland Garros and while there's little surprise to see Maria Sharapova lining up for what will be her third successive French Open final, few would have backed Simona Halep to progress to the final weekend in Paris.
Outside the top 50 this time last year, Halep has stormed into a first ever grand slam final without even dropping a set. The last player to waltz into the last two without a blot on her copybook was Lindsay Davenport at the 1998 US Open final and she went on to beat Martina Hingis 6-3, 7-5 to clinch a first major. Could Halep repeat the feat?

"2014-06-11","2014 Mosul offensive: Insurgents continue their offensive, gaining control of the city of Tikrit, the second provincial capital to fall in as many days. At least 500,000 residents of Mosul flee the fighting and head east into Kurdish-controlled territory, while insurgents storm the Turkish Embassy and take 48 Turks hostage, including the Consul General. (Al Jazeera)","armed conflicts and attacks","http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/iraqi-city-tikrit-falls-isil-fighters-2014611135333576799.html","Iraq city of Tikrit falls to ISIL fighters
The Iraqi city of Tikrit has been seized by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, security sources have said, the second city to fall to the group in two days.
Sources told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that gunmen had set up checkpoints around Tikrit, which lies between the capital Baghdad and Mosul, Iraq's second largest city which was captured by ISIL on Tuesday.
""All of Tikrit is in the hands of the militants,"" a police colonel told the AFP news agency. A police brigadier general told AFP that fighters attacked from the north, west and south of the city, and that they were from ISIL.
A police major told the agency that ISIL fighters had freed about 300 inmates from a prison in the city, which is the capital of Salaheddin province.
Iraqi state television reported that special forces soldiers were fighting to regain control of city. Sources claimed the Iraqi soldiers had cleared the city of ISIL, but these reports remain unverified.
Meanwhile, sources said the nearby city of Kirkuk, home to Iraq's biggest oil refinery, was also being attacked by ISIL. Fighters had guaranteed the safety of Iraqi soldiers if they gave up their weapons.
In Samarra, south of Tikrit, witnesses told AFP that fighters had arrived in trucks mounted with machineguns, while a policeman said his unit was involved in fighting at the northwest entrance the city.
The fighting comes after half a million people are reported to have fled Mosul since the city was taken over by ISIL on Tuesday.
The Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration said the Mosul takeover had ""displaced over 500,000 people in and around the city"", a quarter of the city's population.
The Turkish government also said that ISIL had stormed its consulate in Mosul, taking staff and the consul captive.
The ISIL, which also controls large areas of northern Syria, on Wednesday bulldozed a berm marking the border between Iraq's Nineveh province and Syria, saying it was ""smashing the Sykes-Picot border"".
The New York Times also reported on Wednesday that Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had repeatedly asked the US to launch drone attacks and airstrikes against the fighters since last month, but Washington had so far refused to get involved.
Al Jazeera's David Schuster, reporting from New York, said while there was no official comment from the US on Maliki's request, officials had been ""quick to point out that the situation in Iraq is under constant review"". 
""The response could be quite different in the days and weeks ahead,"" Schuster reported.
Al Jazeera's Imran Khan, reporting from Baghdad on Wednesday, said aid agencies were under pressure to deliver humanitarian aid as nobody had expected Mosul to fall quite so dramatically.
Earlier in the day, ISIL advanced into the oil-refinery town of Baiji before Iraq's Fourth Armoured Divison forced the group to retreat.
The group had threatened local police and soldiers not to challenge them and warned the town's most prominent tribal leaders to lay down their weapons.
""We are coming to die or control Baiji, so we advise you to ask your sons in the police and army to lay down their weapons.""
And in Sadr City, northern Baghdad, a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside a tent where local Shia leaders were meeting, killing at least 15 people and wounding at least 34 others.","Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant (occ: 11.0 conf: 0.8257636363636363):

"2014-06-26","Uruguay's star striker Luis Suárez is expelled from the tournament, banned for nine international matches and suspended from all football-related activity for four months for biting Giorgio Chiellini of Italy in Tuesday's Group D match. The verdict, the most severe against any player in FIFA World Cup history, means Suárez will be unable to play or train for his club Liverpool until 27 October. (Press Association) (BBC Sport)","sport","http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28023882","Luis Suarez bite: Uruguay striker banned for four months
Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has been suspended from all football-related activity for four months for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.
In addition, the Liverpool player, 27, has been banned for nine international matches, ruling him out of the rest of the 2014 Fifa World Cup.
He will also miss the first nine games of the Premier League season.
Uruguay say they will appeal, calling it an ""excessive decision"" for which ""there was not enough evidence"".
Uruguay Football Association president Wilmar Valdez added: ""I have seen more aggressive incidents recently.
""It is a severe punishment. I don't know exactly which arguments they used but it is a tough punishment for Suarez.""
The player has also been fined 100,000 Swiss francs (£65,680) for the incident, which occurred on Tuesday as Uruguay beat Italy 1-0to finish second in group D and qualify for the last 16 in Brazil.
The ban is the biggest in World Cup history, beating the eight games given to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for elbowing Spain's Luis Enrique in 1994.
""Such behaviour cannot be tolerated on any football pitch and, in particular, not at a Fifa World Cup when the eyes of millions of people are on the stars on the field,"" Claudio Sulser, chairman of the Fifa disciplinary committee, said in a statement.
Suarez has now been found guilty of biting three opponents in his career, and former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson felt the suspension should have been longer.
""Say my boy was about 11 or 12, how do you explain to your lad who's a football fan exactly what Luis Suarez keeps doing?"" he told BBC Sport.
""He is now a persistent offender and I thought actually the ban would have been much harsher.""
Suarez was banned for 10 games for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic during a Premier League match in 2013 and was also suspended for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 2010.
Mexican referee Marco Rodriquez did not see Suarez bite Chiellini on the left shoulder, but Fifa ordered an inquiry after the match following protests by the Italian.
Suarez tried to dismiss the incident, telling Uruguayan television: ""These are just things that happen out on the pitch. It was just the two of us inside the area and he bumped into me with his shoulder.""
Suarez's first match back for Liverpool could be in round four of the Capital One Cup, should the Reds win their first game after entering the tournament in the third round, with matches due to take place in the week commencing 27 October.
Reds chief executive Ian Ayre said: ""Liverpool Football Club will wait until we have seen and had time to review the Fifa disciplinary committee report before making any further comment.""
Under the terms of the ban, Suarez cannot train with Liverpool and is prohibited from entering the confines of any stadium during his suspension.
But Liverpool would not be prevented from selling him this summer should they decide to.
He has already been linked with moves to Real Madrid and Barcelona.
Sponsor Adidas said it ""fully supports Fifa's decision"" and will not use Suarez for any more marketing purposes during the World Cup.
""We will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players,"" added the company. ""We will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with Suarez and his team.""","Luis_Su%C3%A1rez (occ: 11.0 conf: 0.7560545454545454):

"2014-07-15","A ceasefire deal, brokered by Egypt, is accepted by Israel but rejected by Hamas. (The Guardian) (Haaretz)","armed conflicts and attacks","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/israel-accepts-egypt-ceasefire-gaza-hamas","Israel accepts Egypt ceasefire plan to end Gaza fighting
Hamas under pressure to halt rocket attacks after rejecting Cairo-brokered peace deal, saying it had not been consulted
Israel has accepted an Egyptian proposal to end the week-long conflict in Gaza, suggesting that an end to the violence, which has killed more than 180 Palestinians, could be in sight.
But, in a sign of the animosity between the Cairo regime and Hamas, the Islamic movement in Gaza rejected the plan, saying it had not been consulted and terms for an end to the conflict had not been reached.
The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned that Israel would step up its offensive in Gaza if Hamas rejected the Egyptian proposal. ""If Hamas rejects the Egyptian proposal and the rocket fire from Gaza does not cease, and that appears to be the case, we are prepared to continue and intensify our operation,"" he said.
Israel said 24 rockets had been fired from Gaza since 9am local time, when Egypt called for ""de-escalation"".
Diplomatic pressure on Hamas to end rocket attacks on Israeli is likely to mount following Israel's indication of a readiness to bring the fighting to an close. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is closely involved, along with Middle East envoy Tony Blair.
The Arab League welcomed the Cairo initiative ""to protect the lives of the innocent"", further increasing pressure on Hamas.
President Barack Obama said: ""We are encouraged that Egypt has made a proposal to accomplish this (truce) goal which we hope can restore a calm that we've been seeking."" In a speech, he stressed US support for Israel in the face of Hamas's ""inexcusable"" attacks and voiced concern for Palestinian civilian casualties.
The Egyptian deal proposes a full ceasefire to come into effect 12 hours after the start of ""de-escalation"", which should be followed within 48 hours by separate talks between the two parties and neutral mediators on terms for an agreement.
A spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry said the proposal was still in play, despite Hamas's rejection.
""Israel has announced its acceptance of the initiative, the Arab League has accepted it and called on the concerned parties to abide by it, we are in touch with Abu Mazen [Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas] – so we're still waiting for [an official response from] the other side,"" said Badr Abdellaty.
The Israeli security cabinet accepted the Egyptian deal shortly before 9am local time ""The cabinet has decided to accept the Egyptian initiative for a ceasefire starting 9am today,"" Ofir Gendelman, spokesman for Netanyahu, said on Twitter.
Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, rejected the truce deal, saying: ""Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity."" It described the proposal as a ""surrender"".
Hamas's spokesmen in Gaza said the Islamist group had not received an official ceasefire proposal, and its demands must be met before it lays down its weapons. Hamas has specifically called for the lifting of Israel's eight-year blockade on the Gaza Strip, the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and the release of Palestinian prisoners Israel rearrested after freeing them in exchange for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.
Hamas's suspicions are likely to have been exacerbated by Blair's apparent involvement in mediating between the Egyptian president, Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, and Netanyahu. According to diplomatic sources, Blair has been a key interlocutor in recent days.
But the Middle East envoy has little credibility among most Palestinians as he is seen as a staunch defender of Israel's interest and an enthusiast for the Cairo regime and its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, the ideological parent of Hamas. Since Sisi came to power a year ago, the Brotherhood has been outlawed and attitudes towards Gaza, and Hamas in particular, have hardened.
Israel may have calculated that its bombardment of Gaza over the past eight days has achieved its goal of punishing Hamas and the people of the coastal enclave. It may be reluctant to escalate the offensive further, with a ground invasion, for fear of risking Israeli lives and fatally crippling Hamas – a move that would allow more radical groups to fill a power vacuum in Gaza.
Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defence official, said Hamas had been weakened by the air and sea assault on Gaza.
""Look at the balance, and you see that Hamas tried every possible means of striking at Israel while bringing great and terrible damage on its people, from their perspective,"" Gilad told Israel's Army Radio.
""The Egyptian proposal includes a halt to all kind of [military] activity. What this proposal, if it is accepted, means is that, willy-nilly, Hamas did not manage to make good on its intentions.""
Previous military confrontations between Israel and Hamas – Operation Pillar of Defence in November 2012, and Operation Cast Lead in 2008-09 – ended in ceasefire and negotiated agreements that eventually broke down. Most diplomats believe the cycle will continue unless the fundamental underlying causes of the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict are addressed and resolved.
Three rockets were launched from the Egyptian Sinai at the southern Israeli resort of Eilat, wounding four people, according to Israeli officials. They said the salvo was likely fired by Islamist fighters hostile to Israel and the Egyptian government.","Hamas (occ: 20.0 conf: 0.9092399999999998):

"2014-07-17","Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 carrying 298 people from multiple countries is shot down near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. (BBC) (Reuters)","armed conflicts and attacks","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28354856","Malaysia jet crashes in east Ukraine conflict zone
A Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 295 people has crashed in east Ukraine on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.
There are no signs of survivors at the scene of the crash near the village of Grabovo, in rebel-held territory close to the border with Russia.
Both sides in Ukraine's civil conflict accused each other of shooting down the plane with a missile. It is still not clear why the plane came down.
It is the second disaster suffered by Malaysia Airlines this year.
Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Malaysia to China in March and still has not been found.
At a news conference at Schiphol airport, Malaysia Airlines' European chief Huib Gorter said they were still trying to identify some of the passengers from flight MH17.
He said of the passengers that have been identified there were:
Other airlines have announced they are now avoiding eastern Ukraine.
If it does turn out that the Boeing 777 was shot down by the separatists - with weaponry supplied by Moscow - then it could significantly alter the terms of the whole debate surrounding the Ukraine crisis.
Over the past few days there has been growing concern among Western governments that Russia was stepping up its military support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Nato spokesmen insist that more and more heavy military equipment has moved from Russian stockpiles to the separatists across the border.
In response, the United States has strengthened its economic sanctions against Moscow - it is threatening even stronger action - though the European Union has so far failed to follow Washington's lead.
But if Russia in any way had a hand in this tragedy then the pressure - especially on the Europeans - for much tougher sanctions will only grow.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak spoke of his shock and said he was launching an immediate inquiry into the crash.
""This is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia,"" he said.
US and Ukrainian officials said they believed the plane had been brought down by a missile.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said it was an ""act of terrorism"".
Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told the BBC he had intercepted phone conversations that proved the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government for restarting military operations in the area, where it is trying to regain control from pro-Russian rebels.
""The country in whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for it,"" he said.
Separatist leader Alexander Borodai accused the Ukrainian government of downing the airliner.
Ukraine's defence ministry issued a statement saying there were no air force jets in the area and no surface-to-air systems being used against the rebels.
The British government has called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the crisis in Ukraine as a result of the crash.
The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk.
At least 100 bodies have been found so far at the scene, an emergency services worker told Reuters news agency, with wreckage spread across an area of up to about 15km (nine miles) in diameter.
Broken pieces of the wings were marked with the blue and red paint of Malaysian Airlines.
""I was working in the field on my tractor when I heard the sound of a plane and then a bang and shots,"" a witness called Vladimir told Reuters.
""Then I saw the plane hit the ground and break in two. There was thick black smoke.""
A separatist rebel from nearby Krasnyi Luch who gave his name as Sergei said: ""From my balcony I saw a plane begin to descend from a great height and then heard two explosions.""
The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers' Union, Sergei Kovalyov, told BBC Russian that the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open during the conflict because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets.
""In order to bring down an airplane from an altitude of 10,000m, you need to have very serious weapons…. missiles,"" he said. ""It's either a mistake or a terrorist act.""
Ukraine has accused Russia's military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels.
Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials blamed the Russian air force for shooting down one of its ground attack jets on Wednesday, and a transport plane on Monday.
In 2001, Ukraine admitted its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 people on board.","Ukraine (occ: 7.0 conf: 0.7927142857142856):

"2014-08-01","Liberia and Sierra Leone declare a state of emergency in response to the Ebola virus disease by sending in troops and ordering the closure of schools and markets and the quarantining of affected communities. (Reuters) (The Guardian)","health and medicine","http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/01/uk-health-ebola-leone-idUKKBN0G00PW20140801","Sierra Leone declares emergency as Ebola death toll hits 729
FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency and called in troops to quarantine Ebola victims, joining neighbouring Liberia in imposing controls as the death toll from the outbreak of the virus hit 729 in West Africa.
The World Health Organisation said it would launch a $100 million response plan on Friday during a meeting with the affected nations in Guinea. It is in urgent talks with donors and international agencies to send more medical staff and resources to the region, it said.
The WHO on Thursday reported 57 new deaths in the four days to July 27 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, raising the death toll to 729. It said the number of Ebola cases had topped 1,300.
“The scale of the Ebola outbreak, and the persistent threat it poses, requires WHO and Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to take the response to a new level, and this will require increased resources,” WHO Director General Margaret Chan said.
Sierra Leone’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, announced a series of emergency measures, to initially last 60 to 90 days, in a speech on Wednesday night.
“Sierra Leone is in a great fight. Failure is not an option,” he said.
Security forces will enforce a quarantine on all centres of the disease and help health officers and aid workers to work unhindered, following attacks on health workers by local people.
Liberia has put in place measures including the closure of all schools and a possible quarantine of affected communities.
The outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever, for which there is no known cure, began in the forests of eastern Guinea in February, but Sierra Leone now has the highest number of cases.
Koroma said he would discuss ways to combat the epidemic with the leaders of Liberia and Guinea at Friday’s meeting.
The jump in the number of cases and the death toll has raised international concern and placed poor health facilities in the region under strain.
The United States was providing material and technical support to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, said the senior U.S. diplomat for Africa, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
African officials will discuss further assistance at a meeting in Washington next week, she said.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in an effort to curb the spread of the Ebola outbreak.
CDC Director Thomas Frieden said the agency will send an additional 50 health experts to help efforts to control it.
Authorities in Nigeria, which recorded its first Ebola case last week when a U.S. citizen died after arriving on a flight from Liberia, said all passengers travelling from areas at risk would be temperature-screened for the virus.
But international airlines association IATA said the WHO was not recommending any travel restrictions or border closures due to the outbreak, and there would be a low risk to other passengers if an Ebola patient flew.
However, the Seychelles have forfeited their African Nations Cup qualifying tie against Sierra Leone after the Indian Ocean island nation refused Sierra Leone’s soccer team entry on Thursday over Ebola fears.
The disease kills up to 90 percent of those infected, though the fatality rate in the current epidemic is running at around 60 percent. In the final stages, its symptoms include external bleeding, internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea - at which point the virus becomes highly contagious. Sierra Leone said passengers arriving and departing Lungi International Airport would be subject to new measures, including body temperature scans.
Two regional airlines, Nigeria’s Arik and Asky, cancelled all flights to Freetown and Monrovia after a U.S. citizen, Patrick Sawyer, died in Lagos last week. He had arrived on an Asky flight from Liberia.
The WHO said authorities in Nigeria had identified 59 people in the airport and hospital who had come into contact with Sawyer, whose flight also stopped in Ghana and Togo.
Nigeria’s Civil Aviation Authority suspended Asky for bringing Ebola to Lagos, a city of 21 million people and the continent’s biggest metropolis.
Health officials are scrambling to avoid an Ebola outbreak in Lagos, but say there are so far no signs of further cases.
Ghana is introducing body temperature screening of all travellers from West African countries at Accra airport and other entry points. Authorities there are monitoring 11 passengers who disembarked from Sawyer’s flight.
The U.S. Peace Corps said it was withdrawing 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea after two of them came in contact with a person who later died of the virus.
The condition of a U.S. physician and a missionary who contracted Ebola while helping fight the outbreak in Liberia has worsened. They will be transferred back to the United States and treated in a high-security ward at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, hospital officials said on Thursday.","Sierra_Leone (occ: 13.0 conf: 0.8805615384615385):

"2014-08-03","The Islamic State seizes the Yazidi-dominated town of Sinjar. (BBC) It also seized control of the Mosul Dam, which is Iraq's biggest dam, the Ain Zalah oil field, and two more towns. (Reuters)","armed conflicts and attacks","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28631770","UN warns of 'tragedy' as militants take over Iraq towns
The UN has warned that up to 200,000 people have been forced to flee their homes after militants took over more towns in northern Iraq.
Islamic State (formerly known as Isis) militants are reported to have taken over the town of Sinjar near Syria.
It follows the IS takeover of the town of Zumar and two nearby oilfields from Kurdish Peshmerga forces on Saturday.
IS seized large parts northern Iraq from government control in a major offensive in June.
The UN special envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, said that a ""humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Sinjar"".
""The United Nations has grave concerns for the physical safety of these civilians"" he said.
""The humanitarian situation of these civilians is reported as dire, and they are in urgent need of basic items including food, water and medicine"" he added.
The UN said many of those who fled are in exposed areas in mountains near the town.
Many of those in Sinjar are believed to have fled from earlier IS advances in northern Iraq.
The town is home to a large community of Kurdish Yazidis, whom IS consider heretical.
Two Yazidi shrines have reportedly been destroyed in the town.
Kurdish military forces, known as the Peshmerga, were also forced to retreat from the nearby town of Zumar on Saturday after a militant offensive.
Kurdish forces had held the town since the Iraqi army retreated from the are in June.
Eyewitnesses said militants also seized control of two small oilfields near Zumar.
IS already controls several other oil installations in northern Iraq, which are believed to fund its activities.
Iraqi state television reported that the militants also took control of Mosul Dam on Sunday after the withdrawal of Kurdish forces.
The dam is the largest in Iraq and provides much of Mosul's electricity.
Further south, clashes between the Iraqi army and sunni militants continued near the town of Jufr al-Sakhar, military officials said.
The Iraqi army said it conducted several airstrikes on militants in the centre of the town, which lies about 60 km south-west of Baghdad.
The town was captured by the militants last week.
The fighting this summer has been one of the worst crises to hit Iraq since the withdrawal of US forces in 2011.","Insurgency (occ: 7.0 conf: 0.6015285714285714):

"2014-08-03","A magnitude 6.1 earthquake kills at least 367 people and injures more than 1,700 in Yunnan, China. (BBC)","disasters and accidents","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-28630110","China earthquake kills hundreds in Yunnan province
At least 367 people have been killed and some 1,300 injured by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake in south-west China, state news agency Xinhua says.
The US Geological Survey said the quake struck about 11km (seven miles) north-west of Wenping in Yunnan province at 16:30 local time (08:30 GMT).
A major rescue and relief operation is under way.
State broadcaster CCTV said the earthquake was the strongest to hit the province in 14 years.
The USGS said the quake struck at a depth of about 10km in a remote mountainous area in Yunnan province.
The tremor was also felt in the neighbouring provinces of Guizhou and Sichuan.
Xinhua said about 12,000 homes had collapsed in Ludian, a county of some 439,000 people, north-east of Yunnan province's capital, Kunming.
All of the casualties reported so far are in Qiaojia County of the Zhaotong region, which appeared to be the hardest hit.
Ma Liya, a resident of Zhaotong, told Xinhua that the streets there were like ""battlefield after bombardment"", adding her neighbour's house, a new two-storey building, had collapsed.
The government is sending 2,000 tents, 3,000 folding beds, 3,000 quilts and 3,000 coats to the disaster zone, the report said.
After initial reports of a death toll of 26, the numbers of casualties rose sharply, passing 150 before Xinhua reported a figure of 367 killed.
The news agency says the epicentre of the earthquake was in Longtoushan in Yunnan's Ludian county.
Chen Guoyong, the head of Longtoushan township, told Xinhua that many houses had fallen and rescuers had been sent to the epicentre.
Many people rushed out of buildings onto the street after the quake hit, electricity supplies were cut and at least one school collapsed, Xinhua reports.
Communications have also been seriously affected.
South-west China lies in an area that is prone to earthquakes.
An earthquake in Sichuan in 2008 killed tens of thousands of people.
And in 1970, a magnitude 7.7 quake in Yunnan killed at least 15,000 people.","Earthquake (occ: 6.0 conf: 0.7190499999999999):

"2014-08-10","Michael Brown incident in Ferguson, MO: Protests about police shooting a teenager on Saturday in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson turn ugly with looting and vandalism. (CNN)","law and crime","http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html?eref=edition","Fatal police shooting in Missouri sparks protests
The officer tried to leave his vehicle just before the shooting on Saturday afternoon, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, Belmar said.
All shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said. He further said the medical examiner would issue a ruling on how many times Brown was shot, but ""it was more than just a couple.""
The account was in stark contrast to those of witnesses who said Brown did nothing to instigate the shooting and appeared to be surrendering when he was killed.
Hundreds of demonstrators -- as many as 1,000 at the height of the protests, according to police -- converged on the scene Saturday, at one point driving away a police squad car, French said on Twitter.
Demonstrators held their hands in the air and chanted, ""We are Michael Brown."" Others held signs, including one that said, ""No justice, no peace"" and another that read, ""Police stops should not = dead kids."" There were reports that some protesters yelled, ""Kill the police.""
Later, according to media reports, about 100 people took their protest to the Police Department in Ferguson, a northernsuburb that's about a 20-minute drive from St. Louis. Officers were deployed to ensure the demonstrations were peaceful, the police chief said.
""We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting,"" local chapter President Esther Haywood said in a statement.
The officer ""shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,"" Johnson told KMOV. ""He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""","Protest (occ: 4.0 conf: 0.610975):

"2014-08-11","Oscar-winning American comedic actor Robin Williams is found dead at age 63 by asphyxiation. (MSN) (CNN) (New York Times)","arts and culture","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/showbiz/robin-williams-dead/index.html","Robin Williams dead; he was battling depression
(CNN) -- Robin Williams -- who first made America laugh and eventually touched ""every element of the human spirit"" in a remarkable range of performances -- died at his Northern California home Monday.
Williams apparently took his own life, law enforcement officials said. He was 63.
""He has been battling severe depression of late,"" his media representative Mara Buxbaum told CNN. ""This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.""
Coroner investigators suspect ""the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia,"" according to a statement from the Marin County, California, Sheriff's Office.
""This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,"" Schneider said.
""On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.""
Word of Williams' death stunned the entertainment community and beyond Monday.
President Barack Obama's statement sent from the White House summed it up:
""Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between.  But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.  He made us laugh.  He made us cry.  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets.""
Comedian Steve Martin tweeted, ""I could not be more stunned by the loss of Robin Williams, mensch, great talent, acting partner, genuine soul.""
Former CNN host Larry King said he would remember Williams as ""a genuine caring guy.  Not just a funny man, but a guy who cared about people.""
Marin County deputies responded to an emergency call from Williams' home in unincorporated Tiburon, California, at 11:55 a.m., reporting ""a male adult had been located unconscious and not breathing,"" the release from the sheriff said.
Williams was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m., it said.
Williams was last seen alive at his home, where he lives with his wife, at about 10 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's statement said.
""An investigation into the cause, manner and circumstances of the death is currently underway by the Investigations and Coroner Divisions of the Sheriff's Office,"" the sheriff's statement said.
""Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made.""
An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, the sheriff said.
Williams made at least two trips to rehab for drug treatment, including a visit this summer, and he underwent heart surgery in 2009.
Williams, born in Chicago on July 21, 1951, studied theater at Juilliard School before taking his stand up act to nightclubs. He was cast as Mork, an alien visitor to Earth, for a 1978 episode of television's ""Happy Days.""
""Happy Days"" star Henry Winkler said it was ""unimaginable that this is the reality today, that this incredible human being, incredible, delicate, funny, dramatic human being is gone.""
Winkler said he ""realized I was in the presence of greatness"" at Williams' first rehearsal as Mork.
""I just realized my only job is to keep a straight face,"" said Winkler, who played ""The Fonz."" ""And it was impossible. Because no matter what you said to him, no matter what line you gave to him, he took it in, processed it, and then it flew out of his mouth, never the same way twice. And it was incredibly funny every time.""
The role led to the spin-off show ""Mork & Mindy,"" which showcased Williams' usual comic improvisation talents.
He proved his dramatic acting skills in ""Good Will Hunting,"" a 1997 film that earned him a best supporting actor Oscar.
His memorable movies over the past three decades includes ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""The Birdcage."" The list is much longer.
Williams credited the influence of Jonathan Winters' comic irreverence and quirky characters as a great influence on his comedy. The connection between the two was completed when Winters was cast as Williams' son on ""Mork & Mindy.""
When Winters died in 2013, Williams saidhe was ""my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend."" He tweeted that Winters was his ""Comedy Buddha.""
""Mork & Mindy"" co-star Pam Dawber simply said ""I am completely and totally devastated. What more can be said?""
WIlliams and Dawber reunited on TV earlier this year onan episode of the CBS comedy ""The Crazy Ones."" 
Williams' fans can look forward to four more movie appearances coming to theaters, including another installment in the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise.
The film, set for a December release, has Williams reprising the Teddy Roosevelt role he delivered in the first two comedies.

(News Limited)","arts and culture","http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/emmys-2014-winners-nominees-opening-jokes-and-more/story-e6frfuf0-1227036962296","Winners, nominees, opening jokes and more
The parade of gorgeous gowns has begun for the 66th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, with Hollywood’s elite strutting their stuff for the second time this week.
KEEP us bookmarked through the day for rolling coverage of the winners, losers and best gags from today’s Emmy Awards ...
Approximately 27 hours later, the Emmys are done for another year. Awards-wise, it felt like an exceptionally safe year: Breaking Bad was given a fitting swan song, taking out several major awards in honour of its final season. Modern Family proved it really is an unstoppable force in the Best Comedy category, landing a fifth win in a row.
The biggest upset? For our money, it’s Orange Is The New Black going home empty-handed. With wins at the Creative Arts Emmys in the lead-up to today’s ceremony, we thought all signs pointed to the wonderful inmates at Litchfield Prison going home with at least one award.
Comedian Billy Crystal’s tribute to friend Robin Williams was heartfelt and pitch-perfect - let that be a lesson to you, MTV VMAs.
It was left to the presenters and winners to provide the most unexpected moments of the night — Ricky Gervais’ faux-bitter presentation after losing out on the Best Actor Emmy was a delight, as was Billy Eichner’s pre-taped street interview which taught us one thing: people in New York could care less about the Emmys.
Winner of the Best Writing — Variety award, Sarah Silverman appears to have been stoned during the ceremony. That's certainly one way to make it to the end of the show.
And let’s not forget the moment Julia Louis Dreyfus stopped on the way up to collect her Best Comedy Actress award to gun for another gong: World’s Longest Pash with Bryan Cranston.
Halle Berry’s on stage to present the final award of the night ...
Series creator Vince Gilligan accepts the award, calling it a “wonderful farewell to our show.”
It sure is: acting gongs for Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, a writing award and now the biggest award of the night, outstanding drama.
Jay Leno’s up to present the award for best comedy. “It's hard to believe we're nearly a tenth of the way through the ceremony,” he says. DON’T JOKE, JAY.
“Orange is the New Black”
That makes it five years in a row for Modern Family. Orange is the New Black woz robbed. ROBBED WE TELLS YA. Head of the Modern Family team starts getting played off before he’s even landed his first joke. One more to go, gang ...
“Please welcome a woman who starred in Mystic Pizza 25 years ago, and was never heard from again — Julia Roberts!” - Uh, hasn’t Seth Meyers already done a variation of this joke about three times tonight? Julia’s here to present a big one:
It could only be Bryan, recognised for the final season of Breaking Bad. Top marks to Julia Roberts for making it All About Her when presenting the award — “Apologies to anyone who doesn’t get to hug me in the next 10 seconds,” she said, before reading out the winner.
“I don't know why I’ve been blessed with an abundance of good fortune,” Cranston says. “I love acting and I will do it until my last breath. I have so much gratitude.” Beautifully humble speech, with a couple of laughs too: he thanks his on-screen wife Anna Gunn for all their great scenes together, “especially the ones in bed.”
The favourite gets it. Good for Julianna, but this has been a very safe Emmys so far, hasn’t it? No big upsets. “What a wonderful time for women on television,” Julianna says during her speech. AMEN.
Moira Walley-Beckett takes it out for her writing work on Breaking Bad. “To my brilliant cast of actors: writing for you was pure joy.” The ‘play her off’ music starts about 15 seconds into her speech. Know what that means — WE’RE RUNNING OVER, PEOPLE!
Anna gets it. Another win for Breaking Bad! She describes the show as “the most extraordinary journey, over the past seven years.”
Next award presented by Debra Messing and Jim Parsons, or, as Seth Meyers calls them: “A couple of Messing Parsons.” *cool guy shades*
Cary Fukunaga accepts the award for True Detective, keeping his speech brief and rocking sweet hair braids.
Comedian Billy Crystal gives an emotional speech in honour of his departed friend Robin Williams. “I used to think if I could put a saddle on him and stay on for eight seconds, I’d be doing OK.”
Telling stories about Williams’ comic genius, he described his energy as akin to a dog that's been kept inside all day that’s finally allowed out to run around.
“As genius as he was on stage, he was the greatest friend you could ever have — present, loving. He was the brightest star in our comedy galaxy.”
Singer Sara Bareilles delivers a beautiful rendition of the classic Smile for the In Memoriam segment, paying tribute to the small screen stars who’ve passed away in the past year- and ending, to huge applause, with an image Robin Williams.
Also, here’s a full report on that brilliant Billy Eichner comedy skit from earlier in the broadcast. Check it out.
Aaron takes it out for the final season of Breaking Bad — it’s his third Emmy win and fifth nomination. In the lead-up to the awards, he sent BB fans on a Twitter scavenger hunt around LA to find memorabilia related to the show — great guy.
Also, how do you keep the audience’s interest while delivering a dry speech about history and activities of the Emmy Academy? Easy — put Modern Family star Sofia Vergara on a revolving platform in a figure-hugging dress.
“Our success is about always giving the viewer something compelling to watch,” the Academy head says.
... Which presenter Gwen Stefani mispronounces as “The Colborrrr Roporrr,” which is a bit awkward. Gwen, you had one job. Perhaps she’s still nursing a post-VMAs hangover?
Before that, Directing — Variety Special goes to Glenn Weiss for the 2014 Tony Awards. He accepts from the control room, where he’s at the helm for the Emmys. How’s that for multi-tasking?
Ricky Gervais is up to present an award, but not before doing a bit about losing the Best Comedy Actor award to Jim Parsons. He reads the speech he would’ve read had he won, thanking the other nominees, including “Joey from Friends.” He points out that he travelled the farthest to be here, so really, shouldn’t he have won it?
He gives the award for Writing — Variety Special to Sarah Silverman. Two risque comedians on stage one after the other — we bet they’ve got their fingers on the ‘censor’ button in the control room right now.
“We’re all just made of molecules and we’re hurling through space right now,” Silverman says during her speech. SMART LADY.
“Please welcome the only person from ER ever to amount to anything, Julianna Margulies! We’re sure George Clooney finds that joke hilarious — we’re also sure that Noah Wyle is at home somewhere crying into his Ben & Jerrys.
The Normal Heart takes it out — phenomenal TV movie about the origins of the AIDS crisis in the early ‘80s. Check it out if you haven’t already, it's heartwrenching stuff with great performances across the board.
Game of Thrones star Lena Headey takes the stage to announce the award for best miniseries — but not before being interrupted by Andy Samberg, in costume as King Joffrey. “Mother! Oh mother, I’ve been poisoned!” “Not now, dear.” Great moment.
Meyers and Andy Samberg introduce Weird Al Yankovic, who’s here to perform a musical sequence in which he puts words to this year’s TV theme songs. Yankovic’s as popular as ever — he just hit number one on the US album charts with his latest musical comedy offering.
Can Kristin Wiig take this one out? If only for the epic speech she’d give?
It’s a good year for American Horror Story: Coven, what with Kathy Bates’ earlier win. Looking stunning at 65, the multi-Emmy winner gives a brief speech.
Amy Poehler’s back! She and Seth work through a few possible introductions to True Detective stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. “One is named after a disciple of Jesus, the other is named after a boner!” “Please welcome the only actors in Hollywood not rumoured to be starring in season two of True Detective!”
The True Detective stars, real-life pals and ultra-chill guys are here to present the Best Actor in a miniseries award:
Benedict isn’t there to accept the award.
Kate Walsh and Scott Bakula have the night’s first minor flub as they take the stage to present an award: “OK, where’s that teleprompter?” Walsh asks nervously. After a shaky start, they’re off:
Fargo director Colin Bucksey wins, and uses his speech to thank his lucky stars he made it back from the bathroom in time to accept the award.
Stephen Colbert is on stage to present the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Miniseries, and delivers a typically histrionic monologue about his imaginary friend, Rosco. Give the man an Emmy for that scenery-chewing performance alone.
“Martin couldn't be here tonight, so I accept this award on MY behalf,” Colbert tells us.
Kathy takes it out, saying she was sure she wouldn’t win because she was seated far from the stage. Kathy, they tricked you!
Allison Janney and Octavia Spencer are here — not to announce a sequel to The Help — but to present an award:
Seth Meyers takes some questions from the audience: Jon Hamm asks if the Emmys will be televised, and Melissa McCarthy offers up a parking question: “Will I get towed?” Andre Braugher asks if he can go to the bathroom. The Portlandia duo Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein start a chant to get the Emmys happening annually: “EVERY YEAR! EVERY YEAR!” Wouldn’t that be nice?
“So You Think You Can Dance”
The show’s 10th win in the category.
Taylor Schilling, “Orange is the New Black”
Is this our best Emmys moment? Julia gives the world’s biggest pash to Bryan Cranston on her way to the stage. Like, HUGE snog. From there, she somehow pulled herself together enough to deliver quite a heartfelt, sincere speech about the joys of working for Veep on HBO.
The favourite takes it out — Jim Parsons grabs his fourth Emmy award. Keeps his speech brief — after four years up there, he’s no doubt run out of people to thank by now.
Seth Meyers introduces COMIC GENIUS Billy Eichner for an epic session of his Billy on the Street quiz show, in which he barks at the pedestrians of New York about Emmys trivia. We’ll bring you a breakout story on that hilarious segment soon.
“Orange is the New Black”
Each nominee tape featured a cute moment from an actor on the show. explaining the best advice their director gave them. Natasha Lyonne, on occasional OITNB director Jodie Foster: “She taught me I could relax because I knew I’d never be as good as Jodie Foster.”
Modern Family takes it out, with director Gail Mancuso directing her speech directly to Matthew McConaughey, because she can’t look at her cast or crew or else she’ll cry.
Jimmy Kimmel presents the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, but not before questioning why bona fide move star Matthew McConaughey is here tonight, muscling in on TV star territory. “Look at that face: that’s a movie star face,” he says, before the camera cuts to “TV star face”, Ricky Gervais:
Kate Mulgrew, “Orange is the New Black”
Surprise win for Janney, who looks stunning and points out that, at 54, she’s currently playing a great grandmother. “Hopefully by next season I’ll be incontinent.”
Zooey Deschanel and Allison Williams present the award for best Comedy Writing to Louis CK for his work on Louie. Haven’t seen it? Hunt it down, folks — it’s one of the best comedies in years.
Seth introduces Amy Poehler who announces the award for “Best on-screen orgasm in a civil war re-enactment” — oops, she means: Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy.
Ty wins it, and reads out a great speech apparently penned by the kids of the Modern Family cast.
Here are the best pearlers from host Seth Meyers’ opening monologue:
Pointing out the diversity of the Best Drama nominees tonight, he said that at the 1976 Emmys, the four Best Drama nominees were all police shows. “Basically you voted for the cop whose hat you liked the most.
“We had comedies that made you laugh, and comedies that made you cry, because they were dramas submitted as comedies,” he said, referencing Orange is the New Black’s contentious inclusion in the Comedy category.
“I would like to congratulate the writers in the room tonight, but their seats are too far away for them to hear me.”
When he asked last year’s hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for help writing his monologue tonight, “they both jumped at the chance to text back, ‘New phone. Who dis?’”
His advice to shows experiencing critical and commercial success: kill off all the characters, or else “before you know it, you’re paying Sheldon a million dollars an episode.”
HBO has 99 nominations tonight: “Not to be outdone, NBC is also a network.”
Former Saturday Night Live cast member Seth Meyers is hosting today’s ceremony, and he already promised E! ’s Giuliana Rancic in a red carpet interview that he wouldn’t be going hard on any of the attendees during his opening monologue. Is he telling the truth, or should some of TV’s finest prepare for a roasting?
As for winners today, there are few sure bets, but our predictions: Bryan Cranston seems a cert for Best Actor in a Drama Series, given his sterling work in the acclaimed final season of Breaking Bad.
Modern Family has won Best Comedy series four times in a row, but can new gal on the block Orange is The New Black snatch the award this year?

"2014-09-12","South African athlete Oscar Pistorius is found guilty of the ""culpable homicide"" of his partner Reeva Steenkamp. (BBC)","law and crime","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29149581","Oscar Pistorius found guilty of culpable homicide
South African athlete Oscar Pistorius has been found guilty of culpable homicide after the judge found he killed his girlfriend by mistake.
Judge Thokozile Masipa said the athlete had acted ""negligently"" when he fired shots through a toilet door, but in the ""belief that there was an intruder"".
She said the state had failed to prove he intended to kill Reeva Steenkamp.
The judge allowed Pistorius to remain on bail ahead of sentencing which is to take place on 13 October.
The victim's parents, June and Barry Steenkamp, condemned the verdict, saying it was ""not justice for Reeva"".
Speaking in an interview with NBC News, June Steenkamp said: ""He shot through the door and I can't believe that they believe it was an accident.""
However Arnold Pistorius, the athlete's uncle, said the family was ""deeply grateful"" to the judge for finding him not guilty of murder and that a ""big burden"" had been lifted.
""There are no victors in this,"" he added. ""We as a family remain deeply affected by the devastating, tragic event... It won't bring Reeva back but our hearts still go out for her family and friends.""
South Africa's prosecuting authority said it was ""disappointed"" Pistorius was not convicted of murder but said it would wait until after sentencing to decide whether to appeal.
The verdict leaves the disgraced sprinter facing up to 15 years in jail, although the judge could suspend the sentence or only impose a fine.
The BBC's Nomsa Maseko said there was a poignant moment in court when Oscar Pistorius's father and Reeva Steenkamp's father hugged each other as the judge adjourned to consider bail.
The athlete was also found guilty on a charge of negligently handling a firearm that went off in a restaurant.
Oscar Pistorius was a picture of composure as the judge announced he was guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser count of murder in South Africa.
The athlete, who became emotional on Thursday after being described as an ""evasive witness"", seemed to have been expecting this verdict. The judge had already spoken of his negligence and use of ""excessive force"" when he fired through the door.
Some say this verdict is the best outcome he could have hoped for.
Many South Africans have questioned the judge's decision to acquit him of murder and argue that the prosecution may have grounds to appeal.
For now, the Pistorius family seem relieved. But in the benches opposite them, friends and relatives of model Reeva Steenkamp wept, while others, including her mother June, seemed shell-shocked.
The double amputee had denied murdering Ms Steenkamp after a row on Valentine's Day last year, saying he shot her by mistake.
With this the judge agreed, saying ""it cannot be said that the accused did not entertain a genuine belief that there was an intruder"".
But she said: ""The accused knew there was a person behind the toilet door, he chose to use a firearm.
""I am of the view the accused acted too hastily and used too much force. It is clear his conduct is negligent.""
Pistorius was convicted on an unrelated firearms charge - negligently handling a firearm that went off in a crowded restaurant.
He was acquitted of another charge of firing a gun in public, through the sunroof of a car, and of a charge of illegal possession of ammunition in the home where he killed Ms Steenkamp.","Judge (occ: 10.0 conf: 0.6110499999999999):

"2014-09-22","NASA's MAVEN space probe successfully arrives in orbit over Mars. (BBC)","science and technology","http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29253788","Mars Maven mission arrives in orbit
The US space agency's (Nasa) latest Mars satellite has arrived successfully in orbit above the planet.
Hurtling through space for the past 10 months, the Maven craft slammed on the brakes by firing its thrusters.
The 33-minute burn removed sufficient speed to allow the satellite to be captured by Mars' gravity.
Maven has been sent to study the Red Planet's high atmosphere, to try to understand the processes that have robbed the world of most of its air.
Today, the air pressure is so low that free water at the surface would instantly boil away.
Maven's data will enable scientists to build better models of current and past climate conditions on Mars.
""Previous spacecraft have made measurements and we've learned a lot about the upper-atmosphere, but we haven't been able to put the whole end-to-end picture together,"" said principal investigator Bruce Jakosky.
""I'm hoping Maven will be a mission of discovery, that almost everything we observe will lead us to fundamental new insights about the Mars environment today and how it has evolved over time,"" the University of Colorado, Boulder, researcher added.
The American probe's arrival will be followed 48 hours later by India's first satellite to the Red Planet.
The Mars Orbiter Mission, informally known as Mangalyaan, has slightly different objectives.
But one important atmospheric study it will try to make is an observation of methane - a potential indicator of biological activity on the planet.
""Nasa is really quite interested in cooperating and correlating data-sets,"" said Dr Jim Green, Nasa's director of planetary science.
""As both spacecraft get into orbit and the scientists understand their data, those opportunities will open up.""
Monday's big manoeuvre on Maven's engines placed the satellite in a high, elliptical, 35-hour orbit around the planet.
Confirmation of capture was received on Earth shortly before 0230 GMT (2230 EDT Sunday; 0330 BST).
In the coming weeks, engineers will then work to bring Maven into a regular 4.5-hour, operational orbit that takes the probe as close as 150km to Mars but also sends it out to 6,200km.
These first few weeks will also be used to commission and test the instrument packages on board.
The present-day atmosphere of Mars, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, is extremely thin, with atmospheric pressure at the surface just 0.6% of the Earth's surface pressure.
The Martian landscape, though, retains channels that were evidently cut by abundant, flowing water - proof that the planet had a much denser atmosphere in the past.
Some of the air would certainly have reacted with, and been incorporated into, minerals at the surface.
But the most likely explanation for its loss is that the solar wind - the great outflow of energetic particles from the Sun - has simply eroded it through time.
This has been possible because, unlike Earth, the Red Planet lacks a protective global magnetic field, which is capable of deflecting the abrasive assault from our star.
Some of Maven's instruments will concentrate on the Sun's influence, looking at how much energy it puts into the planet and its atmosphere.
Others instruments will investigate the composition and behaviour of the atmosphere itself, and this will involve some ""deep dip"" manoeuvres that take Maven closer to Mars' surface so it can sample air molecules directly.
The intention is to measure the rates at which these different molecules are being lost today, distinguishing between the various processes responsible.
Scientists will use this information to get some insights into the history of the Martian climate - from the time billions of years ago when it was warmer and wetter, and potentially habitable to life, to the present environment which is cold and desiccated.
Important inputs will come from Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is studying the bottom of the atmosphere.
The robot has already used the concentration of argon to show an enrichment of the heavier form of this element has occurred through geological history.
It is evidence that lighter argon atoms have been lost preferentially from the top of the atmosphere.
An early demonstration of Maven's capabilities will come in October when Comet Siding Spring makes a close pass of Mars.
This is likely to dump a lot of dust on the planet.
""If significant amounts of dust hit the upper-atmosphere, we'll see increases in the temperature… and it will expand,"" said Prof Jakosky.
""In addition, the water from the comet that hits the upper-atmosphere will begin to populate it with an extra set of molecules.
""We'll look at this perturbation, with the addition of energy and matter, and then see how long it takes to decay away.
""That will tell us about the physical processes that are operating in the upper-atmosphere today.""
