Branch impales woman in car during storm
LONDON, Nov. 12 (UPI) -- High winds and heavy rain buffeting Britain uprooted a tree that crashed into a vehicle, impaling a female passenger and injuring the driver, police said.
Gale-force winds in parts of Britain made it too dangerous for planes to land at an airport, felled trees, downed power lines and forced officials to close at least one bridge, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Northwest England bore the brunt of the storm's fury, with airport authorities diverting in-bound flights from Leeds-Bradford airport because of high winds.
The woman from Pontefract was a passenger in the car when the tree fell on the vehicle and a branch impaled her Thursday, police said.
"This was a tree fallen onto a car and one female, impaled by a branch, was extricated by fire service personnel and passed into the hands of the ambulance service," a spokeswoman for West Yorkshire Fire Service said
Forecasters said winds were expected to ease through the day Friday.
Other hard-hit areas include Anglesey and Northern Ireland, where downed power lines plunged thousands of homes and businesses into darkness. Localized flooding was reported in Wales and on the Isle of Wight. Flight and ferry crossings to the Isle of Man also were canceled.
The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Dartford-Thurrock river crossing was closed Thursday, The Daily Telegraph said.
Meteorologists said about an inch of rain fell during a 12-hour period in Shap, Cumbria, while Lancashire and Yorkshire got about a third of an inch of rain in a similar time period.
