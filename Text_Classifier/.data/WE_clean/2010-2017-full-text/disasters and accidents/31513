Busted airport toilet ruins luggage for hundreds of fliers
A single overflowing toilet created a stinky mess at the Nashville International Airport this week — contaminating up to 200 pieces of luggage, according to reports.
The evil commode, in the woman’s restroom on the C Concourse, began overflowing at about 5 a.m. on Wednesday because of paper towels stuffed inside, airport spokesman Tom Jurkovich told The Tennessean.
The filthy water flowed into a Southwest Airlines baggage area directly below, soiling “a good number of bags” on a conveyor belt, Jurkovich told the paper.
Though it wasn’t clear how much sewage was in the water, 200 bags may have been affected — all of which are being sanitized, the airline said in a statement to the paper. A total of around 380 bags needed to be pulled off the conveyor belt.
Some replacement bags were being offered to passengers, the airline said.
No one came in contact with the water — and an environmental team was called in to clean the baggage handling area, Jurkovich told the paper.
It wasn’t clear whether someone stuffed the toilet intentionally, but the leak will be addressed, he declared.
Some passengers opted to fly without their luggage, and the leak didn’t cause any flight delays, ABC reported.
