NATO, Ukraine officials sign defense cooperation agreement
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 (UPI) -- NATO leadership signed an agreement with the Ukrainian government outlining a roadmap to modernize the country's defense industry and capabilities.
The NATO-Ukraine Defense-Technical Co-Operation agreement was co-signed by NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment Patrick Auroy and Ukraine Defense Council Oleg Gladkovskyi.
The roadmap of priorities include improving Ukraine's armed forces, cooperation in standardization and codification, and enhancing the country's defense industry. The move comes as Ukraine's government pushes for deeper ties with the alliance.
Additional collaborations between the alliance and Ukraine will focus on defense science and technology. Most of the activities included in the agreement focus on the country's role in working with the Conference of National Armaments Directors.
Ukraine has moved closer to NATO and its member states following its 2014 revolution and the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych, and subsequent armed insurgency from pro-Russian militants. Western militaries from the United States, United Kingdom, and others have responded by providing tactical training and material support for the Ukrainian armed forces.
