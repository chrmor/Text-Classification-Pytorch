Bobsled track accident: 2 Calgary teens killed
(CNN)Two brothers were killed after they and a group of friends apparently went down an Olympic bobsledding course on a personal sled on Saturday, authorities said.
Canada Olympic Park in Calgary, Alberta, site of the 1988 Winter Olympics, is currently used as a training facility for athletes and recreational facility for the public.
A group of at least eight teenage boys, Calgary police said, entered the premises after hours and attempted to go down the bobsled track.
"Part way down, the group hit a large gate used to separate the bobsled and luge tracks," police said in a statement.
Jordan and Evan Caldwell, who are twin brothers, died in the crash.

Six others were transported to the hospital for injuries ranging from minor to serious, police said.
"We were reminded today that life is but a vapor. Life is precious, life is fragile, and we must redeem the time we're given," the family of the deceased teens said in a statement. "Our boys Jordan & Evan were bright lights to all who knew them. We are grieving their loss but confident in their new home of heaven."
Investigators are trying to determine how the teens entered the property, and why they decided to take a personal sled down the Olympic bobsled track, police said.
The facilities are operated by WinSport, which is cooperating with the investigation, police said.
The president and CEO of WinSport, Barry Heck, expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
