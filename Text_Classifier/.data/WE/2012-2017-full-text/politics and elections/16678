Video: Syria peace talks to resume as ceasefire begins
Syria's government and rebels will restart peace talks on March 7 if a ceasefire holds and more humanitarian aid reaches civilians, a UN envoy has said.

UN envoy Staffan de Mistura announced the date for the new round of talks less than an hour before a cessation of hostilities entered into force.

On the stroke of midnight, firing stopped in suburbs around the capital and the devastated northern city of Aleppo, reporters said, after a day of intense Russian air strikes on rebel bastions across the country.

Monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was quiet in the north of Latakia province and in the central provinces of Hama and Homs, from where new pictures illustrate the colossal scale of destruction after almost five years of conflict.
"I may be up late tonight and hope I won't be wakened tomorrow by the sound of airplanes," Mohammed Nohad, a resident of Aleppo's southern rebel-held district of Al-Kalasseh, said.
The nationwide cessation of hostilities would be the first pause in fighting since Syria's civil war broke out in 2011.
The UN Security Council threw its weight behind the ceasefire agreement, unanimously adopting a resolution drafted by Russia and the United States that demanded all parties halt fighting.

"Assuming that the cessation of hostilities largely holds – God willing – and the humanitarian access continues unabated, I intend to reconvene ... the talks, the intra-Syrian talks on Monday, March 7," Mr De Mistura told the Security Council.
"Saturday will be critical," Mr De Mistura said. "No doubt, there will be no shortage of attempts to undermine this process."
The cessation of hostilities between President Bashar al-Assad's regime and rebel forces excludes the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group and the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front, which control large swaths of territory.
US Ambassador Samantha Power acknowledged there was "some scepticism" as to whether the ceasefire would take hold, but said it offered the "best chance to reduce the violence."
Taking a swipe at Russia and Syria for intensifying air strikes, Ms Power said it was "hard to seem serious and sincere about ceasing hostilities when you ramp up fighting right up to the minute the cessation of hostilities is to take effect."
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said the ceasefire agreement "can contribute to a turning point" in the five-year war that has left more than 270,000 dead.
"We now have a real chance to stop the violence and step up our collective fight against terrorism," he added.
The resolution endorses the ceasefire deal and "demands" that the cessation of hostilities "begin at midnight (Damascus time)."
The measure urges all countries, in particular those taking part in the Syrian peace process, to "use their influence with the parties to the cessation of hostilities to ensure fulfilment of those commitments."

It renews a call to allow humanitarian aid to be quickly and safely be delivered once the ceasefire takes hold, in particular to besieged and hard-to-reach areas.
It lists about 30 areas in need of urgent aid deliveries, including eastern and western rural Aleppo and the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, which is under siege by Isil jihadists.

The United Nations was forced to suspend peace talks in early February as Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air power, went on the offensive in northern Aleppo province.
Mr De Mistura urged world powers to work to "ensure that the parties come to Geneva again ready to engage and to stay engaged on substantive issues."
