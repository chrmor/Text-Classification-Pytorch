Tension Mounts in Haiti Ahead of Election Results

Haiti voted in presidential, parliamentary and local elections on Sunday that were meant to end a year of political and economic uncertainty. A previous vote in October 2015 was annulled due to allegations of widespread fraud. Official results are not expected until next week.
