In pictures: Greece general strike
A demonstrator kicks away a tear gas canister outside parliament in Athens. Greek police sought to prevent thousands of anti-government protesters in the movement known as the indignants from encircling the parliament, as lawmakers prepared to debate new austerity measures.
At least 30,000 protesters shouted "resign, resign" as the legislators entered the parliament building. Later the event turned violent - as have previous demonstrations in Greece.
Around 5,000 police were deployed to stop protesters encircling parliament. Another focus for the protesters' anger was the Finance Ministry, where several petrol bombs were thrown.
This protester, being arrested for obstruction, is one of an estimated five million workers to join the 24-hour general strike.
The strike comes as the Socialist government begins a legislative battle to push through cost-cutting reforms for Greece that will extend beyond its own term in office.
Signs of the times - many Greeks reject the commitments made by their government to European partners and the International Monetary Fund, which entail cuts of $40.5bn (Â£28bn).
Police made an estimated 40 arrests. They estimated the crowd at parliament at around 30,000, but police estimates tend to be conservative.
