English version: Could be a damaged russian submarine
Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet can reveal sensational information about what happened before and during the ongoing marine search operation in the archipelago of Stockholm, where the Swedish Armed Forces – in their own words – are searching for "suspected foreign activity under water".
In the official version the operation started due to the reports from a "credible source" that had seen a suspicious object on friday.
