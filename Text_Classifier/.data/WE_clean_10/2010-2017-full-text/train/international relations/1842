The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition): Daily News from Korea
North Korea has denounced a UN Security Council vote on Monday to address human rights abuses in the country. The vote increases international pressure on North Korea's leaders. Given the angry reaction so far from Pyongyang, it could also escalate the possibility of confrontation.
The vote to put North Korean human rights violations on the UN Security Council's agenda was passed despite objections from China and Russia. An angry North Korea refused to recognize the meeting. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power was among those who spoke out against the government's alleged crimes against humanity.
"Today we have broken the Council's silence. We have begun to shine a light, and what it has revealed is terrifying," said Power.
This was the first time North Korea's human rights situation had been debated by the U.N. Security Council. International pressure has been intensifying on Pyongyang since the release of a U.N. report this year documenting a network of political prisons in North Korea and atrocities that include murder, enslavement, torture, rape and forced abortions.
As a procedural rule, once the Security Council votes to put an issue in its agenda, that issue can be brought up again at any time.
Phil Robertson, of the international rights group Human Rights Watch, said that means the international body intends to keep the pressure on North Korea.
"Kim Jong-un better watch out. He's now facing a determined international consensus armed with strong information about the crimes that have been committed by him and his predecessors and a determination to see this through," said Robertson.
