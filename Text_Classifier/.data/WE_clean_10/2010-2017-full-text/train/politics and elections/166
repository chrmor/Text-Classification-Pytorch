Afghans praised for voting in shadow of violence
The United Nations and NATO praised Afghans for their courage in turning out to vote in parliamentary elections despite the threat of extremist violence amid fears over poll irregularities.
At least 14 civilians were killed in the second parliamentary vote since the 2001 US-led invasion ousted the Taliban but more than 3.5 million Afghans took part in the election.
Insurgents fired rockets in several cities and set off bombs at a polling station and beside a convoy carrying the governor of Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold in the south, but officials said several more attacks were foiled.
Stressing that it was not a final figure, Fazil Ahmad Manawi, the country's senior election official, said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centres, according to preliminary data.
"This makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters," he said.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised voters for their "courage and determination," according to a UN statement received in Kabul.
