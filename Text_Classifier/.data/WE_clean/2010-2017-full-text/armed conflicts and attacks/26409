Three Spanish journalists released from captivity in Syria return to Spain
In a brief interview with EFE news agency, the journalists said they had been kept confined in at least six different houses. Mr López said that after three months of captivity, Mr Pampliega was taken elsewhere. The three were only reunited on Saturday when they were released.
The men said they had been kept in small rooms, just big enough to do exercise in. They could not tell whether they had remained in Aleppo the whole time.
According to the Syrian Observatory of Hunan Rights, the three experienced freelance reporters went missing last July 13 when they were travelling through Aleppo in a van. Their Syrian translator was also taken hostage but was released shortly after.
For a time the Spaniards were held hostage alongside the missing Japanese journalist Jumpei Yasuda, seized at around the same time.
"When I spoke to him by telephone, it was wonderful," the mother of Mr Pampliega, María del Mar Rodríguez Vega, told the association Reporters Without Borders. "He had the same voice as when he was a child and he kept saying sorry for what he had put me through".
In 2014 three other Spanish journalists were freed after being held hostage by Syrian extremists for months. The Spanish government is believed to have paid a ransom for their release as in several other cases in which Spaniards have been kidnapped by jihadi groups.
In August 2014, the Islamic State group decapitated James Foley, an American journalist who was seized in northern Syria in 2012.
