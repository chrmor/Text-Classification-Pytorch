Explosion near Pakistani capital of Islamabad kills at least 26
A blast at a fruit market in the Pakistani capital killed at least 26 people Wednesday and injured dozens more, hospital officials said.
The blast was close to a bus stop in Islamabad at the entrance of the morning bazaar at a time when vendors arrive and set up for sale.
There has been no claim of responsibility so far, said police spokesman Shaukat Nawaz.
The Pakistani Taliban announced a cease-fire in March that extends until Wednesday.
