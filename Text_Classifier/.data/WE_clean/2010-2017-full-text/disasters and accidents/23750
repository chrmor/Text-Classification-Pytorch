Seven dead after high speed train catches fire and derails in France
The test train came off the tracks outside Eckwersheim, near Strasbroug, and plunged into a river.
Dramatic pictures on social media showed the train upended and partially submerged in the water.
There has not been any link established with the Paris attacks.
A witness, a teenage girl having a lesson at a nearby riding school, told Dernieres Nouvelles Aâ€™Alsace (DNA) she saw the train catch fire and then overturn. It is believed the train may have struck a nearby bridge before catching fire.Emergency services have been deployed to the scene.
Pictures from the scene showed the locomotive partly submerged in a canal alongside the tracks with other parts lying broken and detached in a field beside the track.
