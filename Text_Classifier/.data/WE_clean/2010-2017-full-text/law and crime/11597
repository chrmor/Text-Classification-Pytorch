15th Most Wanted Fugitive Captured in Mexico
After 24 years of searching, authorities in San Diego located and apprehended their fifteenth most wanted fugitive on Friday.
Vincent Legrend Walters, 45, was located in Cancun, Mexico, by deputy U.S. Marshals.
According to agents, Walters had been on the run for the past 24 years and is wanted in San Diego for the September 1988 kidnapping and murder of Kristine Suzzette Reyes.
He is also wanted on drug charges, including manufacturing methamphetamine and drug trafficking, according to a statement from the deputy U.S. Marshals service.
Walter was using the alias “Oscar Rivera” and working at the Cancun International Airport.
Agents said Walters would often boast to people about his life on the run as a wanted fugitive.
Walters will be transported to Mexico City first and then extradited to San Diego to face murder and drug charges, agents said. It is still unclear when, exactly, he will be back in San Diego.
For officials, justice will soon be served thanks to the ongoing efforts of U.S. Marshals.
“The U.S. Marshals are thrilled with the capture of this violent fugitive. This is a prime example of the sheer determination and persistence we have when tracking down a wanted criminal,” said Steven Stafford, U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of California, in a statement Friday.
“Vincent Walters is accused of committing a number of crimes that landed him on our most wanted fugitive list,” said David Harlow, Assistant Director of the U.S. Marshals Investigative Operations Division. “Thanks to the hard work of our Deputy U.S. Marshals, local law enforcement and Mexican law enforcement partners, we were able to bring Walters in to face the consequences for his laundry list of accused crimes.”
