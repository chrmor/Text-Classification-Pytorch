Egypt decides to open Rafah crossing
Egyptian authorities decided on Friday to open the Rafah border crossing into the Gaza Strip for humanitarian cases and to allow Palestinians stuck in Egypt to return to the enclave, state television reported.
The Rafah crossing links Egypt's Sinai Peninsula to the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas. It was the first time the crossing had been opened since President Hosni Mubarak was toppled a week ago. (Reuters)
