Gotthard base tunnel breakthrough (Photos)
In more happy miner news, "Sissi," a massive drilling machine, chewed through the final few meters of rock at the Gotthard Base Tunnel on Friday, creating the world's longest train tunnel. With a length of 35 miles crossing the Alps, the tunnel should become operational at the end of 2017. The construction costs will run about $13.6 billion. Here are some photographs of the tunnel and the breakthrough ceremony:
