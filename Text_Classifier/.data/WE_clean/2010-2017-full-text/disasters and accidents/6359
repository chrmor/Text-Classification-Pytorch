At least 56 dead in US storms
STORMS that spawned deadly tornadoes have flattened buildings and knocked out power lines across the central and southern United States, raising the death toll to at least 56.
Forty-five people were killed in Alabama alone, authorities said, and on Wednesday US President Barack Obama ordered the government to 'move quickly' to get search and rescue aid to the southern state.
Earlier, states of emergency were declared in Alabama; Arkansas; Kentucky; Mississippi - where officials said 11 people were killed; Missouri; Tennessee; and Oklahoma.
Governors called out the National Guard to help with rescue and cleanup operations.
