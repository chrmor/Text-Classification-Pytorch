Seven children were killed in a fire at a private orphanage in Henan province on Friday morning, according to reports on several Chinese websites.
The fire broke out in Lankao county around 8am at the home of local resident Yuan Lihai, said the reports.
Yuan, a street vendor in Lankao, has adopted orphans and deserted babies over the years, according to the reports.
The children were staying at a place close to Lankao’s county hospital when the fire broke out.
The police are investigating the cause of the fire and it is not yet clear how many people were injured.
This is the second major tragedy involving children in Henan in recent months.
A knife-wielding man injured 22 children and a woman at a primary school in the province’s Guangshan county in December last year.
