South Korean President Says She’s Open to Talks With Japanese Leader
SEOUL, South Korea — President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said Thursday that she was willing to meet one-on-one next month with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, a development that would be welcomed by American officials, who have repeatedly urged Washington’s two key East Asian allies to mend their strained relationship.
Speaking in Washington, where she is scheduled to meet on Friday with President Obama, Ms. Park said that a November meeting in Seoul between herself, Mr. Abe and Premier Li Keqiang of China would provide a chance for her to meet alone with the Japanese leader for the first time.
“I think I can take that opportunity to hold a bilateral summit with Prime Minister Abe,” Ms. Park said while addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research institute.
Her comment was the clearest indication yet that the two countries were preparing for such a meeting, after months of negotiations. Mr. Abe on Friday reiterated his desire for bilateral meetings with both the Chinese and South Korean leaders, said Takeo Kawamura, a former chief cabinet secretary who is serving as an envoy for Mr. Abe on the issue.
