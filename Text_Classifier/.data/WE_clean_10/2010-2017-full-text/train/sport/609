Paddy Crerand hits out at Keane over Nani red card
Former Manchester United player Paddy Crerand hits out at Roy Keane for agreeing with Nani's controversial red card in Tuesday's Champions League game against Real Madrid.
Nani's sending-off proved to be a turning point in the game, as Manchester United went on to suffer a 2-1 defeat by the Spanish team, which sealed a 3-2 aggregate loss.
Crerand told BBC Ulster's Nolan Show: "Roy Keane was in a minority of one. Not one person said it was a red card except Roy."
