At least 365 people were killed and 5,500 injured in Egypt's street protests against the government, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday.
The ministry said the death toll was preliminary and would most likely increase because officials were still gathering data across the country. A total of 123 injured people remain in hospital.
At least 32 police were killed and over 1,000 wounded during the uprisings, the Interior Ministry said.
Egypt was swept by street protests from on January 25. Protesters ousted 25-year President Hosni Mubarak from power on February 11, plunging the country into havoc.
