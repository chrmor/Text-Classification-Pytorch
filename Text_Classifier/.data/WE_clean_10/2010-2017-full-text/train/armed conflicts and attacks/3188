PESHAWAR, Pakistan Two Pakistani intelligence officials say a suspected U.S. missile strike has killed four people in northwest Pakistan near the Afghan border.
The officials say the drone fired three missiles into a house on Sunday in Datta Khel town of North Waziristan.
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The officials say the people who were in the house have not yet been identified. The area is home to various local and foreign al Qaeda allied militant groups. The Pakistani military has not launched any major offensive in the region and Washington relies mostly on drone strikes to battle militants.
