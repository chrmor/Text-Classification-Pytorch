Iran naval ships plan to cross Suez Canal on Tues
ISMAILIA, Egypt, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The Egyptian agent for two Iranian naval ships has requested that the vessels pass through the Suez Canal on Tuesday, a canal official said.
Israel has said it takes a “grave view” of the Iranian move, which will involve an Iranian frigate and a supply ship.
The northbound convoy from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean leaves at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT), according to the Suez Canal schedule. (Reporting by Yusri Mohamed, Writing by Edmund Blair)
