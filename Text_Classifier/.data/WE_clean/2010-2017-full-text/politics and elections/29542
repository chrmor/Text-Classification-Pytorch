Challenges Await Antonio Tajani, the European Parliament’s New President
BRUSSELS — Antonio Tajani was elected president of the European Parliament on Tuesday, and he won’t have much time to settle in.
Mr. Tajani, an Italian who beat out his countryman Gianni Pittella in the fourth round of voting, takes over as the European Union confronts an array of pressing issues.
The Parliament is the only directly elected body among the bewildering list representing the European Union, but it often struggles for relevance — a fact underscored when Mr. Tajani’s ascendance on Tuesday was overshadowed by a speech by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on plans for her country to leave the bloc, and an address by Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, in Davos, Switzerland.
Mr. Tajani, 63, from the European People’s Party — the Parliament’s largest political group, with 217 members from 27 nations — was the favorite for the post.
