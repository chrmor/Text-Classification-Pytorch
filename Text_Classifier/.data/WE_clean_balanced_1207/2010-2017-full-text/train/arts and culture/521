Aretha Franklin has pancreatic cancer: reports
Soul singer Aretha Franklin, who recently underwent surgery for an undisclosed health issue, is reportedly suffering from pancreatic cancer, the Detroit News says on its website.
Publicists for the 68-year-old could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Detroit News report cites a source familiar with the situation for the cancer diagnosis, an illness which the report pointed out has a poor prognosis.
Separately, the Fox television station in Detroit reports the same diagnosis for the Queen of Soul, citing a close relative as the source.
The report says she was doing "OK".
Franklin released a statement on December 2 saying that she had undergone "highly successful surgery" but did not disclose the nature of her illness.
Earlier, she cancelled all her appearances through May 2011.
The legendary singer of 1960s hits like Chain Of Fools and Respect had continued a busy schedule of touring and recording until late October.
In January 2009, she sang at the inauguration of US president Barack Obama.
