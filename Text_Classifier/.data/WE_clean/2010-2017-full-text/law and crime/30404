And "there was no indication the gun was visible upon his arrival at the school," Maass told reporters, referring to the gunman. Anderson had told the school he had come to drop something off for Smith, Burguan said.
Authorities are looking into Anderson's criminal background, which includes domestic violence and weapons charges. A .357 revolver was found next to Anderson, who is believed to have fired six rounds before reloading, Burguan said.
Anderson opened fire "very, very quickly upon entering the classroom," around 10:30 a.m. local time, Burguan said. A short time later, police reported the "current threat at North Park ES has been neutralized."
