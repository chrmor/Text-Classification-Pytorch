Police: 4 dead in Tulsa home in apparent murder-suicide
TULSA, Okla. (AP) â€” The bodies of four people, including two young boys, were discovered in a Tulsa home in what police suspect was a murder-suicide.
Sgt. Dave Walker told the Tulsa World newspaper that all four apparently died from gunshot wounds and that police were not seeking a suspect. Capt. Matt McCord said that "based on the physical evidence inside the house," officers believe an adult male killed a woman and two boys then himself.
Officers found a handgun near the man's body, McCord said.
McCord said the bodies may have been in the house "as many as two days," based on when the four were last seen and a preliminary examination of phone records. Investigators said the two boys were younger than 10.
Neighbors said they were surprised by what happened and said the area is safe.
Vinicio Perez said he walks his dog, Coco, down the same street in the Stone Creek Farms development. Perez said he would sometimes see two children playing and bouncing around in the front yard of the home where the bodies were found.
"I'm shocked," Perez told The Associated Press. "This place should be a place surrounded by security."
Most every property in the neighborhood has a large fence, so kids can play or swim in privacy, though some play hoops in the driveway or at a cul-de-sac.
"I love this neighborhood. It's very quiet here," Perez's wife, Mercedes, said.
