Angry crowd riots on Thai resort island of Phuket to protest 2 killed during police chase
An angry crowd hurled homemade fire bombs and torched vehicles at a police station on Thailand's resort island of Phuket over the weekend.
The protest drew more than 100 local residents who were angered by the deaths of two young men who died in a motorcycle collision with a police car on Saturday.
The protest turned violent late Saturday and lasted until order was restored early Sunday.
Police Lt. Col Amnuay Kraiwuttinan said police were chasing the motorcycle because the two men, 17 and 22 years old, were drug suspects.
The rioting occurred outside the Thalang Police Station, which is on a main road to the airport. Amnuay said protesters blocked the road from 8 p.m. Saturday to 4 a.m. Sunday, inconveniencing tourists who were trying to reach the airport.
