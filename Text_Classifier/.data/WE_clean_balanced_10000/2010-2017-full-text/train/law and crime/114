Iraqis react to Hashemi death sentence
Iraqis have been reacting to yesterday’s death sentence handed to the country’s fugitive vice president, Tareq al-Hashemi, for running death squads.
He was once the most senior Sunni Muslim in the Shia-dominated Iraqi government.
In Shia neighbourhoods of Baghdad, while locals welcomed his conviction but they remain cautious of potential sectarian tensions.
“If the decision was a decision based on the rule of law, and not political or motivated by any other reasons, then it is a bold one and I hail it,” said one man.
“Hashemi deserves death if he is accused of murder and terrorism. But the question is how many people who face similar charges of murder and terrorism are still in power, whether in Iraq or abroad?”
Hashemi has declined to comment on the ruling.
He has been living in Turkey since April and Ankara has so far refused to hand him over to Iraqi authorities.
