Former NATO Chief Named Poroshenko Adviser
Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen says he will do his "utmost to promote security, economic reforms, and stronger EU ties" in his new capacity as an adviser to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Rasmussen made the comment on Facebook on May 28, one day after Poroshenko announced the appointment. Poroshenko's announcement did not specify on what issues Rasmussen would be advising.
Rasmussen described the "security situation" in eastern Ukraine as "alarming." He also said Ukraine must fight corruption and implement reforms.
Russian Duma member Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Interfax that Rasmussen's appointment was "a hostile gesture" toward Russia.
"It shows that Ukraine has chosen the West and NATO as the vector of its drifting movement," he said, describing Ukraine as "a beachhead against Russia" that "will be used sooner or later."
Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the Federation Council's International Relations Committee, said on Facebook that Rasmussen's appointment, like many other Ukrainian moves, is "for show" because "Ukraine badly needsâ€¦attention from the outside."
