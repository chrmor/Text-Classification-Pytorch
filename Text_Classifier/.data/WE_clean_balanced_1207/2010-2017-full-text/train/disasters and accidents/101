Flood situation turns critical in Germany, central Europe
Flooding brought on by strong rainfall in central Europe and a burst dam in Poland have caused widespread damage and the deaths of at least ten people in the area near the borders of Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic.
The deep, eastward-flowing river Viola in the municipality of Neukirchen in Saxony in eastern Germany became a raging torrent on Saturday, drowning an elderly couple and their neighbor as they tried to save their washing machine from flooding in the basement.
The eastern German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg are now bracing for the arrival of flood waters.
Water levels were highest in Zgorzelec on the river Neisse at 7.4 meters, according to Sunday reports from Polish broadcaster TVN24. Parts of the city were submerged and several historic buildings have been damaged.
The Neisse has swollen dramatically after a dam on the Witka reservoir in Poland burst on Saturday evening. Polish Interior Minister Jerzy Miller, who visited the crisis area overnight, said repairing the dam was the highest priority.
Water levels in Saxony, eastern Germany also broke records, with the state flood agency measuring 7.02 meters on Sunday morning in the border town of Goerlitz - the highest since the government began keeping records in 1912.
Normal water levels in the summer are around 1.7 meters.
