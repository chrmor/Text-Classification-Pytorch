Israel warns Gaza aid boat
Israel says it could use force to stop a new aid boat to Gaza, as Lebanon refuses to bow to warnings against authorising an all-women ship to head for the blockaded Palestinian territory.
In a letter sent to UN chief Ban Ki-moon, Israel's UN ambassador Gabriela Shalev said the stated intention of the Bolivian-flagged cargo ship, the Mariam, was "to violate the existing naval blockade of Gaza".
Israel also had information that another vessel, the Naji al-Ali, plans to leave from a Lebanese port with the aim of violating the blockade, she said.
"Israel reserves its right under international law to use all necessary means to prevent these ships from violating the aforementioned naval blockade," Shalev warned.
She said such "confrontational actions by the organisers as well as those that offer their consent, is deeply troubling and requires the attention of the international community."
Israel came under international censure over its May 31 seizure of a six-ship aid fleet bound for the Palestinian territory when Israeli commandos shot dead nine Turkish activists in a clash on the lead boat.
