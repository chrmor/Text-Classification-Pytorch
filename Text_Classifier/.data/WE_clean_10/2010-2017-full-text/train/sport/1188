Drogba set to join Galatasaray
Galatasaray has agreed to an 18-month contract with former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, according to the Turkish club.
Drogba is currently playing for the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, but according to a statement on Galatasaray's website, he will sign the deal once his team's run at the competition comes to an end.
The 34-year-old left Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in China last year after leading the London side to its first Champions League title, and he will join another high-profile January signing at Galatasaray in former Inter Milan midfielder Wesley Sneijder, who completed his move last week.
Galatasaray has now significantly upgraded its team ahead of its round of 16 clash with Schalke in the Champions League, with the first leg to be played in Turkey on Feb. 20.
