Democrats lose grip in Cook Islands
The Democratic Party which has dominated Cook Islands politics for the last decade has lost its grip on power in the Pacific nation.
On Friday, preliminary counts revealed The Cook Islands Party had won a majority of seats in Wednesday's general election, securing 15 of the 24 spots up for grabs.
About 300 postal votes were still to be counted, but it was unlikely these could reverse the preliminary counts, Radio New Zealand International said.
Henry Puna will become the country's new prime minister, with Teina Bishop stepping up as his deputy, according to Friday's count.
Prior to the polls, former prime minister Jim Marurai, who has been in office since 2004, said he planned to stand down whether his party won the elections or not.
However, the decisive performance of Puna's Cook Islands Party silenced speculation that the country might need to form a coalition government, or that independent MPs might hold the balance of power.
