Ivory Coast attack: 16 killed as gunmen strike hotels
(CNN)The United States and France have pledged assistance to Ivory Coast as the West African nation investigates a terror attack that left at least 16 people dead.
Gunmen stormed three hotels Sunday in the beach resort city of Grand-Bassam, officials said. Foreign nationals, including a Frenchman and a German woman, were among the dead.
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility on a social media account tied to the group.
Two soldiers and 14 civilians were among those killed, President Alassane Ouattara said as he visited the sites of the attack.
Three terrorists were killed in the attack, the Ivory Coast presidency said on its Facebook page Monday, citing Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko.
On Sunday, Ouattara gave the number of terrorists killed in the attack as six. No information was immediately available Monday clarifying the discrepancy.
The President declared three days of national mourning. He urged the Ivorian people to come together and to not give in to fear.
"I condemn in the strongest terms these heinous and cowardly attacks on innocent people," he said. "Ivory Coast will not be intimidated by terrorists."
The attack began shortly after midday Sunday when the beach at Grand-Bassam -- about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the country's largest city, Abidjan -- reportedly was packed with people swimming, relaxing and eating at beachside cafes. The area is popular with wealthy Ivorians and Westerners, particularly on Sundays.
"Truly, truly it was terrifying," said Yapi Marie Claire, who witnessed the attack. "We never thought it could happen here under these circumstances. It's truly not easy. It's not easy."
In a statement, Goethe-Institut President Klaus-Dieter Lehmann said it was terrible "that a woman who campaigned for a meaningful life with all her strength had to die so senselessly."
Grohs had been in Ivory Coast since 2013. Before then she had worked for the Goethe-Institut in Johannesburg and earlier the Berlin Philharmonic, the statement said.
Johannes Ebert, the institute's secretary-general, said in a statement that Grohs' colleagues were stunned that she had been "snatched so tragically and cruelly from life."
"She loved her work and was full of ideas, and full of energy to implement these ideas," he said.
The French Embassy said it had set up a crisis unit and asked people to limit travel in the area and stay clear of security forces. The British Foreign Office had similar advice.
Operation Serval Targeting French interests had been a priority for the group since France launched, at Mali's request, Operation Serval , a U.N.-sanctioned ground and air operation against jihadists in 2013. It was succeeded in August 2014 by Operation Barkhane, a broader French anti-terror mission targeting Islamists in the Sahel, with a 3,000-strong force headquartered in Chad.
While Serval was successful against Islamist militants in Mali, subsequent operations have been less effective, allowing militants across the region to reconsolidate, he said.
The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist organizations, said in an analysis of Sunday's attack that AQIM had "escalated its operations in West Africa, specifically targeting Europeans, as well as other foreigners, in hotels and resorts."
ISIS "AQIM is also competing with ISIS for reassertion and dominance in West Africa, among other regions," the group said.
