KUNA : Japan''s new car sales jump 92 percent
TOKYO, May 1 (KUNA) -- Japan's domestic sales of new vehicles surged 92.0 percent percent from a year earlier in April for the eighth consecutive monthly increase, data released by an industry body showed Tuesday. Sales totaled 208,977 vehicles last month and outpaced a 78.2 percent growth in March, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Of the total, 187,036 passenger cars were sold in the reporting month, up 92.6 percent from a year earlier. The figures don't include sales of mini cars. Japan's new car sales plunged last year following the March 11 magnitude 9.0-earthquake and tsunami, as the twin natural disasters disrupted manufacturing operations at automakers, causing supply shortages nationwide. But production recovered to the pre-disaster level within several months, and resumption of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars from late December has helped push sales. By automaker, Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales soared 188.4 percent to 102,550 vehicles, followed by Honda Motor Co. with 30, 561 units, up 61.5 percent. (end) mk.mt KUNA 011745 May 12NNNN
