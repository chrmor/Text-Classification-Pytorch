Clashes erupt outside the presidential palace in Brazil's capital Brasília between anti-Workers' Party protesters and supporters of ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, where he was due to be sworn in as President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff's chief of staff. Hundreds of anti-government protesters calling for Rousseff's impeachment and Lula's arrest also blocked the central Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, Brazil's largest city and economic hub. (Reuters)
