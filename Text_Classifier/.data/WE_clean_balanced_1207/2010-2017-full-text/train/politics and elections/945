Former premier Bob Carr has been officially endorsed by the New South Wales Parliament to fill the Senate vacancy left by Mark Arbib.
Mr Carr still has many friends in the state's Parliament, and there was much good-natured joking as a joint sitting was held this afternoon to formally endorse him as the state's next senator.
Premier Barry O'Farrell told the sitting: "I declare that the honourable Robert John Carr has been chosen to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator, the honourable Mark Arbib."
Before the ceremony, Mr Carr was heckled for seven minutes as he spoke to reporters gathered at the steps of Parliament.
The heckler, who had been protesting against the public service cuts of the O'Farrell government, repeatedly yelled "shame Bob", labelled the state's longest serving premier a "disgrace" and accused Mr Carr of being a Zionist puppet.
"Kevin Rudd rocks," Sydney man Brian Concannon screamed from behind the security fence at one point, reminding Mr Carr of the man he will soon replace as foreign minister.
Mr Carr took the abuse in his stride, even trying to turn it into a positive.
"We're a knock-down, drag-out democracy and I think that's a good thing," Mr Carr said.
"If someone wants to come along and shout at a candidate for public office, that's terrific.
"In the old days they used to throw eggs."
He went on to declare he was relishing his return to political life.
"I look forward to serving the people of New South Wales in a new capacity," he said.
The senator-elect will next be sworn into Federal Parliament before taking on his designated role as foreign minister.
