2 killed, 6 hurt in stabbing at Edmonton warehouse
A man wearing body armor and carrying two knives fatally stabbed two employees in a Edmonton, Alberta, grocery warehouse, police said.
Six other employees were injured in the attack at the massive Loblaw grocery warehouse, two of them very seriously, police spokesman Malcolm Allan said at a press conference Friday.
The suspect fled and was arrested without incident in a vehicle not long after the violence, Allan said.
Allan identified the suspect as Jayme Pasieka, 29, an employee of the warehouse.
Police said they didn't know the motive for the attacks, but noted that the use of body armor indicated the attack was planned.
