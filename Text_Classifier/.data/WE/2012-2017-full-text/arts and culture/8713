'American Hustle' cast takes top honors
"What a way to go out in style," Bryan Cranston said as he accepted the honor on behalf of the cast of the TV drama series about a ruthless meth kingpin. The series ended its run last fall, but is still reaping the rewards. Cranston also topped off his Emmy and Golden Globe wins with the SAG prize for male actor in a drama series for playing Walter White.
