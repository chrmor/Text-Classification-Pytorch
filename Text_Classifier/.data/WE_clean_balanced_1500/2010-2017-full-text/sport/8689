Napoli match-fixing point deduction & defensive duo's bans overturned
The Azzurri are now only three points adrift of Serie A leaders Juventus, while Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava are clear to play football at the San Paolo Stadium once again
Napoli have seen their two-point deduction over a match-fixing scandal erased, while Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava had their six-month bans overturned, it was revealed on Thursday.
The Italian side had been fined €70,000 (£58,545) and seen their points tally this season reduced by the Disciplinary Commission due to Matteo Gianello’s attempt to fix matches.
The formerPartenopei goalkeeper was banned for three years and three months in 2012 after admitting he offered to fix Napoli’s clash with Sampdoria in May 2010.
Cannavaro and Grava were given half-year sentences to sit on the sidelines for not reporting being approached by Gianello ahead of the game, but they insisted that such a conversation never occurred and the defensive veterans have been cleared on appeal.
The Federal Court’s decision means the Azzurri sit just three points behind Juventus in Serie A, level with Lazio but ahead of the Biancocelesti on goal difference.
Cannavaro and Grava will return to Napoli’s squad and will be available for selection immediately.
