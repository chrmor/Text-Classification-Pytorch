Car bomb 'kills 10' in Kurdish-held Syrian border town
A car bomb killed at least 10 people on Wednesday in a Syrian town near the Turkish border held by US-backed Kurdish-led forces, a monitoring group said.
Another nine people were wounded in the attack in Tal Abyad, which was captured from the Islamic State group by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and allied Arab groups in June last year, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The alliance was formalised in October 2015 into the Syrian Democratic Forces, which then seized swathes of northern and northeastern Syria from IS with US support.
An SDF official said the car bomb was detonated outside offices of the Kurdish autonomous administration on the town's main street.
He said nine people were killed.
The Kurds and their allies have now captured most of the Turkish border areas that had been under IS control, depriving the jihadists of access routes for foreign fighters and funds.
The SDF is currently fighting the jihadists in the town of Manbij, across the Euphrates River to the west, threatening what was a key staging post on one of their few remaining entry routes.
