The University of Louisville, whose men's basketball team was linked to illicit payments by Adidas to the family of freshman player Brian Bowen, places head coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich on administrative leave, pending further university action. Pitino's attorney tells Louisville's newspaper, The Courier-Journal, that Pitino has been "effectively fired", and multiple media reports indicate that Jurich has also been effectively fired. Louisville men's basketball was already on NCAA probation due to violations related to a recent sex scandal. (CBS Sports)
