ISRAEL has ordered an investigation after soldiers burst into a house in a pre-dawn raid yesterday and shot dead a Palestinian civilian in his bed.
Amr Qawasme (65) was killed yesterday morning during an operation to re-arrest five members of Islamist group Hamas who had been released from a Palestinian jail a day earlier.
His widow, Sobheye, described how the soldiers burst into the family home in the West Bank town of Hebron and shot her husband in his bed.
"I was praying when they entered. They put their hand to my mouth and a rifle to my head," Mrs Qawasme said, adding that she then heard shots from the bedroom.
The Hamas militant who was the target of the raid apparently lived on the floor below. (Â© Independent News Service)
