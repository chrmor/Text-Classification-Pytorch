Gonzalo Higuain completes Juventus transfer from Napoli
Gonzalo Higuain has become the world's third most expensive player after completing his £75.3m move from Napoli to Juventus.
The Argentina international has signed a five-year contract with the Serie A champions worth £6.3m per season.
Higuain passed a medical in Madrid on Friday after Juventus agreed to pay the 28-year-old's full release clause - a record transfer fee for the Serie A. 
Real Madrid's purchases of Cristiano Ronaldo (£80m) in 2009 and Gareth Bale (£85m) in 2013 are the only deals that have cost more than Higuain's transfer to Juventus.
He becomes manager Massimiliano Allegri's fifth signing of the summer following the acquisitions of Miralem Pjanic, Dani Alves, Medhi Benatia and Marko Pjaca. 
Higuain, who also reportedly attracted interest from Arsenal and Atletico Madrid, joined Napoli from Real Madrid in 2013 and had two years remaining on his contract in Naples. 
He ended the 2015/16 season as the top scorer in Serie A with 36 goals and scored 91 times in 146 appearances for Napoli.
Meanwhile, Paul Pogba's move from Juventus to Manchester United is stalling over a stand-off regarding who pays his agent's fee, according to Sky in Italy.
