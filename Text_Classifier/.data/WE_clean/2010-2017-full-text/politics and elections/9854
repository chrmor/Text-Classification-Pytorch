Peru cyclists stage naked protest in Lima about safety
Hundreds of scantily clad and nude cyclists took to the streets of Peru's capital, Lima, to call attention to safety conditions on the city's roads.
Campaigners say that thousands have been killed on the roads because of reckless driving.
Many of the cyclists painted slogans and signs on their bare skin.
Reports say the convoy cut off roads along an 11km (6.8 mile) route through the main thoroughfares of Lima.
"This is our body. With this, we go out in the streets. We don't have a car to protect us," event organiser Octavio Zegarra told the Associated Press news agency.
Between 300 and 500 cyclists are estimated to have taken part in the mobile protest.
Cyclists on the protest highlighted a number of complaints, such as not having a dedicated cycle lane.
"I have gone naked because it's the way to raise awareness of our rights for example the bicycle lanes that are never free, there are always taxis parked, police sleeping," protester Milagro Esquivel told the Reuters news agency.
