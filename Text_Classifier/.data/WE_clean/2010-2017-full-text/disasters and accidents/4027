Powerful earthquake shakes Pakistan
The quake struck at 1:23am (2023 Tuesday GMT), with its epicentre around 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of the town of Dalbandin, close to the border with Afghanistan, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.
Television footage showed panicked people rushing out of their homes and into the streets in very cold conditions, reciting verses from the Koran.
USGS said the quake had a magnitude of 7.2 and hit at a depth of 84 kilometres, revising down its initial report of 7.4-magnitude.
Pakistan's Meteorological Department gave a magnitude of 7.3 and located the epicentre 55 kilometres northwest of Kharan, a town in the thinly populated southwestern Baluchistan province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.
"The earthquake occurred at around 1:23am and it was felt in Baluchistan, Sindh and southern Punjab provinces," chief meteorologist Mohammad Riaz said.
"There could be aftershocks during the next week â€“ there are active fault lines in Baluchistan."
There were no immediate reports of any casualties. Rescue services said that they were on alert after the quake, but so far had received no emergency calls.
Strong tremors were felt as far away as the Indian capital Delhi, around 1,300 kilometres distant, as well as several other cities across northwestern India.
Northern Pakistan was hit by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake on October 8, 2005 that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
