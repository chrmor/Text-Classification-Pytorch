Finland approves new nuclear reactors
(CNN) -- Finland's parliament Thursday approved the construction of two new nuclear reactors, a foreign ministry representative told CNN.
The reactors are aimed at making the country self-sufficient in electricity generation by 2020, she said.
The Nordic country's climate and energy strategy includes building more nuclear plants, using more renewable energy sources, and increasing conservation and efficiency, the government says.
There is no specific date set for the construction to start, the ministry said.
The measures passed despite the opposition of the Green Party, which is a member of the government.
