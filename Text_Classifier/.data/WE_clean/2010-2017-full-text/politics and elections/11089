HBO sorry over 'George Bush' head in Game of Thrones
The makers of Game of Thrones have apologised for a decapitated head resembling George W Bush that appeared in the first series.
HBO said it was "deeply dismayed" about the head's likeness to the former US president.
It appears in a scene where King Joffrey shows Sansa Stark her father's head on a spike.
Show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss also put out a statement apologising for any offence caused.
They explained that the show used many fake body parts, many which were rented out.
"After the scene was already shot, someone pointed out that one of the heads looked like George W. Bush.
"In the DVD commentary, we mentioned this, though we should not have.
"We meant no disrespect to the former President and apologize if anything we said or did suggested otherwise."
HBO's statement also described the matter as "unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste".
"We made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent careless mistake.
"We are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future DVD production."
The head appears in profile in the final episode of the first series.
In the DVD commentary to the show, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss mention its apparent likeness to George W Bush.
However, they tell viewers of the fantasy series: "It's not a choice, it's not a political statement. We just had to use whatever head we had around."
Game of Thrones, set in the fictional world of Westeros, is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.R. Martin.
It's been a big success for HBO - both in terms of viewers and box set sales - and was recently recommissioned for a third series.
