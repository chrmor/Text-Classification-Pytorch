Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra concert to be live-streamed
When two concerts were announced by the extraordinary Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela in the Southbank Centre, tickets sold out instantly – eight months before the performances.
However, there is consolation for passionate fans of the orchestra, which began 37 years ago as part of El Sistema, a scheme to make classical music a tool of social inclusion, and is now a worldwide phenomenon: for the first time both will be streamed live on the Guardian website, on 23 and 26 June.
When they last came to London, 60,000 people flocked to the Festival Hall to hear them.
This time the orchestra, under its dynamic conductor Gustavo Dudamel, will be taking over the South Bank complex for the week, as part of the London 2012 festival, running workshops which members of the public will be invited to join, concerts with other musicians including the Scottish El Sistema-inspired Big Noise, and performances by smaller groups including the Simón Bolívar string quartet.
One of the raucous highlights will be The Giant Orchestra, when musicians of all ages and abilities are invited to come together to form one vast ensemble in the Festival Hall.
Tickets are still available for the open rehearsals by the Simón Bolivar orchestra, and for some of the other events. Others are free and open to all.
