Robot set to enter mine where 29 are trapped
A range of hi-tech gadgets have given fresh hope to the families of 29 men trapped down the Pike River Coal mine.
A specially-adapted New Zealand Defence Force robot will be sent into the mine, which is full of toxic fumes, to see if there are any signs of the men, who have been entombed since Friday.
A camera will be attached to the robot, which will also detect levels of dangerous methane and carbon dioxide gases that have flooded the colliery. The fumes are preventing rescue teams from entering.
It will be sent two kilometres deep into the horizontally dug mine to where the men are believed to be. They have not been heard from since a large explosion shortly before 4pm on Friday.
