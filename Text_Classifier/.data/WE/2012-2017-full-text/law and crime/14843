Police uncover far-Right plot to attack refugee shelters in Germany
Police in Germany have uncovered a plot by far-Right extremists to attack refugee shelters using “highly dangerous explosives”, prosecutors said on Thursday.
Three people have been arrested in connection with the plot following police raids in the Bavarian town of Bamberg. Prosecutors were seeking arrest warrants against a further ten suspects.
They are believed to have been planning an attack on two government shelters for asylum-seekers in the town.
Prosecutors said they intended to throw explosives into the shelters to spread “fear and terror”.
The suspects, eleven men and two women aged between 21 and 36, are believed to be members of The Right, a small local far-Right party, and Nügida, a Bavarian offshoot of the Pegida anti-immigrant movement.
Police seized a gun, knives and illegal fireworks in raids on 12 apartments linked to the group, as well as far-Right propaganda material including a red flag bearing a swastika.
In the past week, investigators intercepted 35lb of fireworks the group had ordered from eastern Europe, including so-called “ball bombs” from Poland.
“If these are thrown into a car or a smaller space, people can be seriously injured or killed,” Werner Mikulasch, the local deputy police chief, said.
The suspects were growing “more radical and more violent by each month,” he said.
Erik Ohlenschlager, the chief prosecutor for Bamberg, described them as a “violent and brutal group” who “are dangerous and have to be taken seriously”.
The shelters the group wanted to target are believed to include a former American barracks in the town that is being used to house some 500 economic migrants with little chance of asylum while their applications are processed.
It was suspected they were planning to carry out an attack on October 31 to coincide with a planned demonstration in the town.
The arrests came even as a confidential police report on the growing danger of far-Right violence against refugees and those who help them was leaked to the media
Political leaders and staff at refugee shelters are particularly at risk, according to the report by the Federal Criminal Police (BKA), a national investigative agency.
Henriette Reker, the new mayor of Cologne, was stabbed and seriously injured by a far-Right extremist over her support for refugees just hours before she was elected last weekend.
It has now emerged that the BKA warned of the risk of attacks just days before the incident.
Even people who could be mistaken for asylum-seekers because of their appearance are at risk of attack, according to details leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and NDR and WDR television.
There has been a wave of arson attacks on refugee shelters across Germany, but police fear the extremists may adopt new tactics such as blockading roads and railways in an attempt to stop refugees.
There have been a total of 505 attacks on refugee shelters so far this year, including arson, vandalism and graffiti, according to newly released figures.
There were 114 such attacks last year, and only 18 in 2011.
Over the weekend police found a mock gallows left outside a refugee shelter in Saxony-Anhalt, in eastern Germany.
Meanwhile a man has been sentenced to two years and three months in prison for inciting violence against Angela Merkel on Facebook.
The 31-year-old man, who has not been named, wrote on Facebook that the German chancellor and her supporters should be “put up against a wall and summarily shot for treason against the German people”.
In another Facebook comment, he called for “the ovens of the concentration camps to fire up again”.
