Hurricane Matthew kills at least 14 in the US
Hurricane Matthew has killed at least 14 people as it battered the US east coast.
As the storm hit there were major floods and power outages in Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina.
Matthew - which was a category 5 storm when it hit Haiti last week killing nearly 900 people - has since been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone but at one point hit wind speeds of over 157mph.
