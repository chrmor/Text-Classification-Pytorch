Son of ex minister Ioan Avram Muresan dies in Kenya hotel
Dan Mureşan, the son of former Agriculture Minister Ioan Avram Muresan, died in his hotel room in Kenya, according to HotNews, quoting various independent sources. The 32-year-old man was working for a British political consultancy firm which developed election strategies in various states of south Africa, south-east Asia and eastern Europe.
According to his profile on LinkedIn, the young man was a graduate of the London School of Economics and Political Science and had a master’s degree in political management from the George Washington University. He had also coordinated election campaigns in the US states of Virginia and Texas, but also in Europe and Africa.
The cause of death is not yet known. Asked to comment by Mediafax, the Foreign Ministry said the Romanian Embassy to Nairobi/Kenya was informed on Saturday of Muresan’s death. The embassy was informed by one of Muresan’s work colleagues.
“The Romanian citizen was working with a British telecommunications company, being in Kenya for a while. He had not yet registered his presence on Kenyan territory with the Romanian diplomatic mission. The same source shows that after the police arrived, the body was taken by an undertaker company for an autopsy,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The embassy is making all efforts to obtain official information about Muresan’s death from the local authorities.
Ioan Avram Muresan was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty of embezzlement.
