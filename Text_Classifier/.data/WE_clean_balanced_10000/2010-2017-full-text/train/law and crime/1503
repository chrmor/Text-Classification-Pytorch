17-year-old boy arrested after 5 shot near Atlanta high school, report says
Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy and charged him with five counts of aggravated assault after he allegedly shot and injured five people near a southwest Atlanta high school on Tuesday, according to a published report.
Atlanta Police officer John Chafee told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Marcellus Brooks had been booked into the Fulton County jail, but a motive for the shooting near Therrell High School had not been determined. 
The paper reported that three of the injured remained hospitalized Tuesday evening. Atlanta Public Schools told the paper that four of the five who were shot were students at Therrell. It was not immediately known if the alleged shooter was a student at the school.
None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening. A spokeswoman for Grady Memorial Hospital told the Journal-Constitution that all five of the injured had been listed in stable condition before two were treated and released. 
The high school was placed on lockdown for students participating in after-school activities.
Parent Shavien Dennis told reporters outside the hospital that her 17-year-old daughter, Tekevious Redding, a Therrell senior, was shot and was still being treated for a bullet lodged in her leg.
"She tried to run and realize she wasn’t running anymore," Dennis said. "She was on the ground and she said blood was everywhere."
One student, Hezekiah Bradford, told the Journal-Constitution that he and his twin brother saw a group of more than 20 students running. Then, he heard at least five gunshots. Hezekiah and his brother ran to a nearby gas station, where they told a woman in a car to call 911.
“I’m worried for some of my friends,” Hezekiah told the newspaper.
