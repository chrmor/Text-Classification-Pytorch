Spain defeat Italy, with a record-breaking scoreline to win their third consecutive major trophy. David Silva, Jordi Alba, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata all score goals, with Torres becoming the first footballer to score in two UEFA European Championship Finals and ending up as the tournament's Golden Boot winner, based on assists and minutes spent on the pitch.
