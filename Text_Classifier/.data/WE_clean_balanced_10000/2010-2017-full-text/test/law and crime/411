New NSA tool to quantify, track intelligence collection revealed – live
We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand:
• The Guardian published a story describing an NSA tool called Boundless Informant that tracks, quantifies and even maps where the agency collects intelligence data. The tool shows the agency collecting almost 3 billion pieces of intelligence from US computer networks over a 30-day period ending in March 2013. Its existence seems to contradict agency statements to congress that it is unable to quantify its surveillance work in the US.
• The Guardian published a slide from the NSA's Prism program showing different methods of data collection under the FISA Amendment Act. The slide distinguishes Prism, which involves data collection from servers, from four different programs involving data collection from "fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."
• The participation or not, under legal compunction or not, of Internet companies in the NSA's surveillance activities remains a matter of competing denials. The companies vehemently deny joining any program but acknowledge receiving requests, albeit not "bulk" requests. The government says it did not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers." At least some of the companies did have a working relationship with intelligence officials that reportedly extended to security clearance for some company employees and possible transfers of data through a safe box.
• The director of national intelligence said news stories about the surveillance methods created "misimpressions" through "inaccuracies." His objection is detailed in the previous post.
• President Obama wrapped up a two-day meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Answering a question shouted by US reporters about how the meeting was going, Obama answered, "Excellent." The president is scheduled to return to Washington Sunday.
