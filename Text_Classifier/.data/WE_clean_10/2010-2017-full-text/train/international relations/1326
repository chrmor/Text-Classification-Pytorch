Egypt denies President Morsi will visit Iran
In the latest round of claim and denial between Iran and Egypt, a spokesman for Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi denied that the new leader, who has been in office since Saturday, will travel to Tehran, Israel Radio reported on Wednesday.
Spokesman Yassir Ali said that Morsi has not received any invitation to visit Iran, responding to previous media reports that the Egyptian president was to attend a conference at the request of Tehran.
Reports had quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi as saying he hoped the visit would strengthen ties between the two countries and lead to an upgrading of their diplomatic relations, with the re-opening of their embassies and an exchange of ambassadors.
