Kolkata: Low-intensity blast on Sealdah-Krishnanagar local train; 14 injured, 1 arrested
As many as 14 people were injured in low-intensity bomb blasts inside an early morning local train on the suburbs of Kolkata on Tuesday, railway police said.
The crude bombs exploded at 3:55am just before the Sealdah-Krishnanagar local entered Barrackpore station. The train which started from Sealdah was going to Krishnanagar in Nadia district.
Seven injured passengers have been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. Seven others were discharged after being administered first aid at a district hospital, a spokesperson for Eastern Railway said.
According to railway police sources, the crude bombs were being carried by a criminal called Raja Das. One of the bombs went off following an altercation between two groups of miscreants inside the fifth compartment of the train.
Das, who lost his arm in the blast, has been taken into police custody.
A few passengers even jumped from the moving train onto the tracks after the blasts.
Local train services have been hit because of the incident.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit out at the police accusing them of a cover-up and demanded an investigation into the incident.
"We have seen blasts in Burdwan and then in Pingla that was extremely powerful. Now, we find criminals hurling bombs at one another inside a train compartment. Bengal is now a fertile ground for such horrible incidents. We want proper investigation so that the real picture comes out," said BJP national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh.
"How can two rival groups sit in the train in the morning and decide to throw bombs at each other? This is a cover up, no case in West Bengal is being handled honestly. This should be investigated," said Singh.
