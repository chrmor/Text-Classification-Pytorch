18 Men Drown Trying to Reach Greece
ATHENS — At least 18 immigrants have drowned in the Aegean Sea while trying to reach Greece from Turkey, a spokeswoman for the Greek port authority said on Saturday, adding that rescuers were seeking nine more people.
The corpses of 18 men were recovered off Lesbos, an island close to Turkey, early on Saturday, the spokeswoman said, adding that a survivor picked up by Coast Guard officers on Friday said that the boat had sunk amid choppy waters. “He told his rescuers that 28 people had been on the boat, including women and children,” she said, adding that there were no details about the ethnic origins of the immigrants.
Dozens of illegal immigrants have died trying to cross into Greece from Turkey in recent years. The borders between the two countries are a key entry point for illegal immigrants seeking a better life in Europe. Thousands of refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria have joined the influx of would-be migrants into Greece, according to the authorities here.
