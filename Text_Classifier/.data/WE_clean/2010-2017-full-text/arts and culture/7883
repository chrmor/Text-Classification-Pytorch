Bollywood condoles the death of Mani Kaul
New Delhi, July 6 (PTI): The bollywood fraternity deeply condoles the death of noted film- maker Mani Kaul. Since his twenties, Kaul had built up an iconic presence in the Mumbai film industry. Well-known director Shekhar Kapur, who acted in Kaul's film 'Nazar', remembers the filmmaker as one who dedicated his life passionately “to exploring the outer edges of the art of film...He believed the most creative acts happen by accident.” Actor Anupam Kher views Kaul as one of the pioneers of new wave cinema. “He was a great conversationalist,” he said. Close friend and sufi singer Madan Gopal Singh recalls that Kaul could have made a very good painter if he was not into films. Singh remembers that in Cannes Film Festival, all the posters of his 1980-film 'Satah Se Utatha Aadmi' were stolen due to its aesthetic appeal. Kaul, 66, is survived by two sons and as many daughters. He breathed his last at 1 AM at his home here after he was discharged from a hospital last night, his family said. Kaul, born in Jodhpur in Rajasthan to a Kashmiri family, was ranked among the film makers who contributed to new Indian cinema with their exemplary movies. His uncle was well-known actor-director Mahesh Kaul. Mani Kaul began his career with “Uski Roti” in 1969 which won him the Filmfare Critics Award for best movie and his other movies like “Ashad Ka ek Din”, “Duvidha” and “Idiot” also got awards. A graduate from the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Kaul got National Film Award for Best documentary film “Siddheshwari” in 1989. Centre's interlocutor on Kashmir, Dileep Padgaonkar, condoled the death and said “he had a luminous mind. He shed light on making innovative films.” ”Mani will be remembered as one of the pioneers, along with Kumar Shahni, of a parallel cinema movement in India. He was also a great teacher of Indian cinema and an accomplished Drupad singer,” he said.
