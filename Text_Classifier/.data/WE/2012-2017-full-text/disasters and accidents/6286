Aizawl: Massive landslide in Mizoram kills at least 8, 11 still missing
A massive landslide in the heart of Aizawl took nine houses and killed at least eight people and left 25 others injured early on Saturday morning.
At least 11 people remained missing by the time of filing this report while six others were pulled out of the rubble by rescue workers, local authorities said.
Several were located and pulled out from the rubble after neighbors and rescuers reached them on their cellphones.
The landslide in the Mizoram capital's Laipuitlang neighborhood follows a week of heavy rainfall in almost all parts of the state, and occurred a little before 3 am.
The houses that were destroyed by the hillside collapse include an abandoned Public Works Department residential quarters (which stood at the top of the part of the hillside that collapsed) and the hall of a local church. The rest were residences.
Several vehicles parked on the road-side were also buried under the rubble and debris.
