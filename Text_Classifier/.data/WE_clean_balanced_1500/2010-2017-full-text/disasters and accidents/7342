Over 600 people sickened by lead poisoning in China
More than 600 people, including 103 children, have been sickened due to lead poisoning in China's Zhejiang province.
Workers and their children in 25 family-run tinfoil processing workshops in Yangxunqiao have dangerously high levels of lead in their blood, official Xinhua news agency said.
Results of preliminary medical tests showed that 26v adults and 103 children are suffering from severe lead poisoning, or with more than 600 micro grams of lead per litre of blood, a spokesman with the county's health bureau said.
The 129 poisoning victims are undergoing a second test, and 12 of them are receiving treatment at a local hospital, the spokesman said.
Another 494 people have moderate lead poisoning, or with 400 to 600 micro grams of lead per litre of blood, the spokesman said.
Lead is commonly used in tinfoil processing.
Medical experts say that children tend to absorb more lead than adults which can lead to fatal levels of lead in their blood.
Excessive amounts of lead in the blood can damage the digestive, nervous, and reproductive systems and cause stomach-aches, anaemia and convulsions.
The 25 workshops have suspended operations, according to the township government. In the township of Yangxunqiao, more than 2,500 people are employed by nearly 200 tinfoil processing workshops.
