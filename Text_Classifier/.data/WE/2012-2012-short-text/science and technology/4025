The first direct photograph of DNA, by Enzo Di Fabrizio, a physics professor at Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro, Italy, is taken. He used an electron microscope (not the usual X-ray crystallography) and a nanoscopic landscape of extremely water-repellant silicon pillars (the water evaporated quickly and left behind the DNA).
