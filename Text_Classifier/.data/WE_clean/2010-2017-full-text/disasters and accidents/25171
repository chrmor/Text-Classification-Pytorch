Nepal plane crashes killing two pilots
A plane crashed in the mountains of northwest Nepal on Friday, killing the two pilots and injuring nine passengers, authorities said. This was Nepal's second aviation tragedy in just three days.
single-engine The Air Kasthamandap flight involved in Friday's crash was carrying 11 people. The plane was heading from Nepalgunj in the country's southwest to the Jumla district in the northwest, said Bhola Guragain, director of the Tribhuvan Airport Operations Department.
the Kathmandu Post Witnesses told the Kathmandu Post that the plane descended steeply and crashed nose-down.
The plane crashed in a field in the mountains in the Kalikot district, said Binod G.C., a police officer in the district.
The latest accident occurred just two days after a Tara Air plane crashed midway through a 19-minute flight, killing all 23 people aboard.
bodies of all the victims Poor weather and dense fog are believed to be the causes of Wednesday's crash. The bodies of all the victims have been recovered. Both planes crashed in northern, mountainous parts of Nepal, but the crash sites are more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) apart.
