Iran media raise Baroness Ashton's neckline in picture at nuclear programme talks
Iran has been embroiled in another censorship row after a top worn by Baroness Ashton was doctored in state media because it was too revealing.
Photographs of the EU foreign minister with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili at talks in Istanbul on Friday appeared the next day in Iranian media - but showed her wearing a top with a much higher neckline than she actually had on.
It appears the garment was too low-cut for the strictly Islamic country and so the image had to be doctored before publication.
Some newspapers raised the top to just below her necklace, while others went as far as covering up above her collar bone.
Baroness Ashton made sure to follow protocol and not cause offence by touching the Iranian politician as she posed for the picture, but she was blissfully unaware that her relatively modest attire would be too racy for Iran.
The EU foreign policy chief was leading an international team of six world powers as they attempted to convince the Middle Eastern country to curb its rogue nuclear activity at the historical Ciragan Palace in Turkey's capital.
Afterwards, she said she was 'disappointed' as the talks ended without progress.
Ashton made sure to show very little flesh at further photocalls at the two-day talks, wearing scarves to prevent the chance of any cleavage being shown.
A spokesman for Lady Ashton told the Telegraph: 'She was properly dressed. It was not low-cut. Many women in Iran are in a complete veil. These were international negotiations in a third country.'
