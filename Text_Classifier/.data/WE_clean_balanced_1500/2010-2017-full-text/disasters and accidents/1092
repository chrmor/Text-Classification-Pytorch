Flood watch in ACT and surrounding regions
12.45am: Adam Spence has kindly sent through the response he's giving to people who are concerned about the state of the dam: "Regarding the unfinished dam overflowing, it's really not as big a deal as it may appear. For starters the original Cotter Dam, which was structurally deficient and the builders underestimated the uplift force on it, was left only half built between the end of WWI and the 1940s. They kept it at a far lower height with a broad, flat top much like the new dam wall is at the moment. Despite the deficiencies and the miscalculations which came to light later, the dam survived very frequent overflowing. When they later raised it, they actually decided not to build it to the originally designed height of 30m because of fears about the integrity of the dam. So from the late 40s to today, it was actually never finished! The new dam is a concrete gravity dam, like the original Cotter. The force that keeps it in place is a combination of the wall against the abutments on each side and more importantly the force of the concrete downwards against the earth by gravity itself. Also, being a concrete dam, overflow does little to erode it. So it's not going anywhere easily. Finally floods have overflown other Canberra dams during construction with no ill effect. The original Cotter flooded during operations to raise it, and the Googong Dam was severely flooded during construction on numerous occasions. Googing being an earth and rock fill embankment, overflowing water is very dangerous and yet it held up." 12.35am: Dave from Uriarra Village tells us he's about to pop down to Cotter Dam for a look, after he finishes off some work (yep, we know the feeling Dave!). "If you think it’s impressive on Dam Cam, it’s even more impressive in real time. The noise and sheer volume of water going through is incredible," he says.
