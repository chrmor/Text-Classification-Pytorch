French Open: Nadal Beats Federer
Rafael Nadal won his sixth French Open, tying Bjorn Borg’s record, with a 7-5, 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-1 victory over Roger Federer, his primary rival and the winner of 16 Grand Slam tournaments.
Nadal started slowly before winning five games in a row to capture the first set, then seemed ready to cruise to his 10th Grand Slam singles victory. But Federer, trying to beat Nadal for the first time in four finals at Roland Garros, surged back behind the wide support of fans at Court Philippe Chatrier. Nadal rolled through the fourth set, putting all his clay courts skills on exhibition.
“Congratulations, Roger, for this fantastic tournament,” Nadal said during the trophy presentation, a familiar end to two weeks at Roland Garros. “I think he do very, very well. Sorry for today.”
Nadal will retain his No. 1 ranking with the victory, fending off No. 2 Novak Djokovic for now. Djokovic won his first 41 matches this year before Federer, ranked third, beat him in the semifinals.
Either Federer or Nadal has held the world’s No. 1 ranking since Feb. 2, 2004, the longest two-man stranglehold since the rankings began in 1973.
