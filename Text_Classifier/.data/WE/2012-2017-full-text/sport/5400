The city of Astana in Kazakhstan hosted the Women's World Chess Team Championship from March 2nd to 12 in the Duman Hotel in Astana. Ten best teams in the world participated: China, Russia, Ukraine, USA, India, France, Turkey, Georgia, Rumania and Kazakhstan. Each team consisted of five players, with four playing in each of the nine rounds of this round robin tournament. Time control was 90 minutes per 40 moves and thirty minutes until the end of the game plus 30 seconds increment per move.
In the ninth round of WWTC Ukraine drew all four games against Russia – all finished peacefully after 31 or 32 moves (above board one with IM Valentina Gunina, 2505, playing GM Kateryna Lahno, 2547).
China outplayed India 2.5-1.5 score – Ju Wenjun defeated Eesha Karavade (picture above) while other games finished in a draw.
A tough match between Kazakhstan and Georgia finished in favor of the latter. Nana Dzagnidze outplayed Guliskhan Nakhbaeva but Abdumalik Zansaya (picture above) defeated Nino Khurtsidze and equalized the score. The youngest player in the tournament (Zansaya) sacrificed a rook at the right moment and didn’t let her opponent escape.
