Former Argos security guard set to rule Gambia as president Yahya Jammeh 'concedes defeat' after 22 years of rule by fear
A former security guard at an Argos catalogue store in London has defeated one of Africa's most feared strongman leaders to become the new president of Gambia.
Adama Barrow, 51, who spent his early years tackling shoplifters at Argos's store on London's Holloway Road, staged a shock victory over President Yahya Jammeh, who had vowed to rule "for a billion years if necessary".
Mr Jammeh, who styled himself "Excellency Sheikh Professor Doctor President", had been in office since a coup 22 years ago, ruling through a cult of fear that fused witchcraft with oppression.Â 
He claimed to have invented his own herbal cure for HIV, and once "exorcised" an entire village of 1,000 people by force-feeding them hallucinogenic potions.
Such was his grip on power that many Gambians thought that even if Mr Barrow did well in the election, the contest would be rigged to deny him victory.
