Pedestrian bridge opens on U.S.-Mexico border that links San Diego and Tijuana airport
U.S. Customs will operate a checkpoint at the bridge for those entering the country, and the protocols (passport check, visas, etc) are the same as any border crossing. The Transportation Security Administration is not involved with security screening on the Mexican side.
