Syrian army, allies launch large attack south of Aleppo
BEIRUT - The Syrian army and its allies launched a big attack overnight on insurgents south of Aleppo, described as the fiercest government assault in the area since a cessation of hostilities agreement came into effect in February. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based organization that tracks the war, said air strikes, artillery and rockets were being used in an attack aimed at recovering the town of Telat al-Eis, captured by rebels in recent days. The al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front shot down a Syrian warplane in the area on Tuesday, capturing its pilot.
