Dow Industrials Log Sixth Year of Gains
The Dow industrials notched a sixth straight annual gain despite a selloff on Wednesday, as investors piled into stocks amid an expanding U.S. economy, growing corporate profits and persistently low interest rates.
Despite Wednesdayâ€™s retreat, the blue-chip index rose 7.5% in 2014. Its ascent is the longest since the bull market of the 1990s, which saw the index climb for nine straight years through 1999.
