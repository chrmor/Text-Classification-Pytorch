Sepp Blatter was the only name on Fifa president ballot paper
With only a solitary name on the ballot paper, it was the kind of election that would do a banana republic proud.
And to the surprise of no one, Sepp Blatter triumphantly regained the crown of world football last night in a humiliating snub to England and Prince William.
Their attempt to derail Blatter’s re-election was overwhelmingly slapped down despite the corruption claims swirling around him.
Delegates at Fifa’s congress in Zurich were presented with a blue ballot paper bearing only Blatter’s name for president.
Yet they still took two hours to elect him winner of the one-horse race.
England’s misery was complete when Blatter’s victory was officially declared by Argentina’s delegate to the congress of world football’s governing body.
Earlier, he had branded England ‘pirates’ and revealed how he had told the team bidding to get England to host the 2018 World Cup that he would only support their bid if the Falkland Islands were handed to Argentina.
Julio Grondona told delegates: ‘We always have attacks from England which are mostly lies with the support of journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth. This upsets the Fifa family.’
Of the 206 football associations who took part in the ballot, 186 voted for Blatter, with three papers spoiled and 17 associations abstaining.
Clutching a bouquet, the rotund 75-year-old Swiss took to the stage to accept the result and told the congress: ‘I thank you for your trust and confidence. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
‘Together we will have four years, provided the Lord gives me life, the energy and the force to continue on our path and to do our job.’
Blatter likened himself to a ship’s captain ‘weathering the storm’ and admitted: ‘We have made mistakes and we will learn from this.
'We are going to put Fifa’s ship back on the right course, in clear, transparent waters.’
The ballot went ahead after England lost a principled attempt to have the election postponed.
Football Association chairman David Bernstein – with backing from FA president Prince William and David Cameron – had called on the congress to abort the vote until a corruption-free candidate could be found.
But the world’s football associations overwhelmingly rejected the FA’s proposal by 178 votes to 17, with even Wales and Northern Ireland snubbing it, though the Scottish FA gave its support.
The humiliation continued with the leaders of associations from Haiti, the Congo, Benin, Fiji and Cyprus all speaking out against England’s ‘lies’.
In a speech before his coronation, Blatter piled insult on injury to England’s failed bid last year to host the World Cup by belatedly vowing, if elected, to fix the corrupt voting system over which he has presided.
But his promise to reform comes too late for England, which lost out to Russia on hosting the 2018 tournament.
England’s bid team – headed by Prince William, the Prime Minister and football star David Beckham – was humiliated last December by winning only two votes amid suspicions that other nations may have been willing to engage in bribery.
The prince remains ‘bitterly disappointed’ by the rejection and last night Mr Cameron backed him by joining calls for reform.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘The most important thing in all of this is that the public have confidence in Fifa and, in order for that to happen, we need Fifa to reform. Fifa needs to get its house in order.’
Blatter declared that in future, World Cup host countries would be chosen differently.
The overhaul would mean that instead of a vote of 24 executive members – nine of whom are presently mired in corruption claims – there would be a ballot of the 208 football associations.
Earlier this week it was alleged that 25 Caribbean officials were each offered a $40,000 (£24,000) bribe three weeks ago to vote for Mohamed Bin Hammam from Qatar in Fifa’s presidential election.
Bin Hammam, Blatter’s only challenger, withdrew his candidacy hours before he was suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee over the bribery allegations along with another executive committee member, Jack Warner of Trinidad, and two other Caribbean officials.
At the same time, an email was revealed in which Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke hinted that Qatar had ‘bought’ the right to stage the 2022 World Cup.
The bungs scandal has damaged trust in the World Cup, but Blatter only responded when big-money sponsors Coca Cola, Adidas and Visa voiced ‘distress’ at the claims.
Last night, FA chief Mr Bernstein said: ‘While we did not succeed in deferring the Fifa presidential election, we are confident the FA has played a significant role as a catalyst for change in the way World Cup hosts will be selected in the future.’
