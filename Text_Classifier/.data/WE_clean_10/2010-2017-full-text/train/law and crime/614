Berlusconi released from bribery trial
Prosecutors had requested a five-year prison term for Mr Berlusconi, who was accused of having paid off his former British tax lawyer David Mills to provide false testimony to protect the billionaire's business interests during two trials in the 1990s.
Judge Francesca Vitale spent three hours considering the verdict after defence lawyers presented their final arguments, but took less than a minute to tell a packed court room that she ruled that the case had run out of time allowed by law.
The prosecutor, Fabio de Pasquale, looked downcast and told waiting journalists: "I just want to get out of here."
Later, his office said it would appeal against the decision and argue that the time limit in the trial did not run out until May.
Mr Berlusconi's lawyers refused to comment. The media magnate, who has always protested his innocence, was not in court. He had left Rome for Milan on Saturday morning, but had come not to court but to watch his football team AC Milan play Juventus.
But Osvaldo Napoli, an MP with Berlusconi’s People of Freedom Party said:”Everything has ended well in Milan ? No it has ended very badly.
"Timing out does not give justice to an innocent man like Silvio Berlusconi and it also hides that black hole that is the civil responsibility of judges.”
The case had turned into a race against time for prosecutors, who were determined to secure a conviction before the case timed out under Italy's statute of limitations.
The usual maximum time for a case to be concluded is 10 years, but the clock was stopped while Mr Berlusconi was prime minister as for most of that time his office conferred legal immunity.
Prosecutors had alleged that Mr Berlusconi paid Mr Mills, the estranged husband of ex-Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell, $600,000 (£380,000) for his court evidence.
Mr Berlusconi, 75, had denied the charge and claimed throughout the trial that he was the victim of a vendetta by a politically-motivated judiciary.
Mr Berlusconi had dismissed the entire trial as "a fairy tale" and a waste of time.
On Friday, on the eve of the verdict, he claimed to be the most persecuted person in the history of the "solar system".
"The Mills trial is just one of many cases which have been invented and used against me," he said in a statement.
He claimed that in the last 14 years he had been forced to attend 2,600 hearings involving 900 magistrates.
He and his companies had been subjected to 588 visits by various Italian police forces and he had forked out €400 million in lawyers' fees.
The level of persecution was not just a "world record but a record for the universe and the entire solar system", the ex-premier said.
He said Mr Mills had been "one of the many lawyers" employed by his holding company, Fininvest, and that he could not even remember meeting him.
But as the trial wound up last week, Fabio De Pasquale, the chief prosecutor in the case, told the court: "There is certainty, beyond all reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the defendant."
Mr Berlusconi's defence lawyers had argued that the case had expired under the statute of limitations sometime between Jan 8 and Feb 9 this year. Prosecutors, using different calculations, insisted that the case would not expire until May at the earliest.
The defence had argued that the bribe was in fact paid by Diego Attanasio, a Neapolitan shipping tycoon. Prosecutors dismissed that, saying it was "based on a fictitious series of false or fabricated documents".
Mr Attanasio has repeatedly denied giving any money to Mr Mills.
Mr Berlusconi, who was forced to resign last November when Italy became engulfed in the eurozone credit crisis, was never likely to have been compelled to serve time in prison, since sentencing in white-collar crimes for people aged over 70 tends to be lenient under Italian law.
But the cases against him may have contributed to a fall in the price of shares in his Mediaset media empire, down by nearly 50 per cent over the past 12 months.
The trial revolved around claims that Mr Mills lied during two trials, in 1997 and 1998, in order to shield Mr Berlusconi and his Fininvest holding company from charges relating to the purchase of US film rights and to "protect Berlusconi's economic interests".
Mr Mills was sentenced to a four-and-a-half prison sentence in 2009 for taking the bribe, but that was overturned in 2010 when Italy's highest court ruled the case had expired under the statute of limitations.
The court said the fact that Mr Mills had accepted the bribe was not in dispute. But it had happened in Nov 1999, and so the offence had timed out under the 10-year limit for prosecution.
Mr Mills initially admitted in a letter in 2004 that he had received money from "the 'B' people", telling his accountant that he had kept Mr Berlusconi "out of a great deal of trouble". He wrote in a letter that while he had not lied in court, he had "turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly".
Mr Berlusconi still remains mired in other legal entanglements, three months after leaving office, as he is still a defendant in three other trials.
One involves allegations of corruption, false accounting and tax fraud, while in the second he is accused of illegally leaking sensitive information from a wire tap investigation into a banking deal.
In the most lurid, he is accused of abuse of office and paying for sex with an alleged under-age prostitute, a Moroccan-born erotic dancer whose stage name is Ruby the Heart Stealer. He denies both charges but if convicted faces up to 12 years in prison.
The dancer, whose real name is Karima El Mahroug, also denies that she slept with him, although she says she attended one of his so-called "bunga bunga" parties at which Mr Berlusconi made "sexual advances" to her and other young women, who undressed in front of him.
The self-made billionaire has spent much of his 20-year political career battling in the courts.
He was convicted three times in 1997 and 1998 for corruption, false accounting and illicit financing of a political party.
But the convictions were later either overturned on appeal or expired under the statute of limitations.
He has repeatedly claimed that judges and magistrates are out to "destroy" him, once comparing their supposed radicalism to the Taliban.
In a recent outburst on Italian television, in which he referred to himself in the third person, he said: "It's judicial persecution, an endless attempt to smear me, which has turned the court into a special court which aims to take Berlusconi out of politics and destroy him as a person.
