At least 31 people dead, dozens injured after a Syrian fighter jet crashes into Ariha marketplace: monitor
At least 31 people were killed and dozens injured after a Syrian military aircraft crashed while on a bombing run over the rebel-held north-western town of Ariha on Monday, a monitoring group said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said it was not immediately clear how many of the dead were from the crash and how many from the prior bombardment.
"It was flying at a low altitude when it had a mechanical failure," SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said.
"At least 31 people, including two children, were killed. Five of them have not been identified."
He added that at least 60 people were wounded.
"Six people are still under the rubble, and we don't know if they are alive or dead," he said.
Residents cited by SOHR said the plane had crashed near a vegetable market, causing "a huge blast".
SOHR, which relies on a wide network of activists, medics, and fighters throughout war-torn Syria, said the fate of the pilot was unknown.
The military plane had dropped a bomb in the heart of the city centre main commercial street where shopkeepers open in the early morning before crashing in the middle of the marketplace, two witnesses said.
"The plane had dropped a bomb on the main Bazaar street at low altitude only seconds before it crashed," Ghazal Abdullah, a resident who was close to the incident, said.
The Damascus regime has relied heavily on its monopoly of air power in the four-year-old civil war, repeatedly pounding rebel-held towns.
It has lost a number of aircraft, some to rebel fire, some to mechanical failure.
In mid-January, at least 35 government troops were killed when a military aircraft crashed in Idlib.
The province has since been largely overrun by a rebel alliance including Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front, which seized Ariha on May 28.
