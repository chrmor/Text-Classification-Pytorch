ACE train car derails, falls into creek near San Francisco
A train car went off the rails and ended up in a creek in Northern California on Monday night, according to the Alameda County Fire Department.
The train derailment was likely caused by a mudslide, with a "pretty significant big" tree being a secondary cause, Union Pacific spokesman Francisco Castillo said. Nine people were hurt; four suffered injuries that were described as serious but not life-threatening.
Authorities earlier reported that 14 people had been injured.

All the passengers from the derailed train have been removed, authorities said.
