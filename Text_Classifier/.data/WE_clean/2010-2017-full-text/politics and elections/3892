Taoiseach Brian Cowen faces down Fianna Fáil critics
The taoiseach, Brian Cowen, faced down moves to oust him as Fianna Fáil leader last night but his survival may only be a stay of execution.
Cowen took a "back me or sack me" stance at a party meeting in the Dail.
None of the three main figures in the running to take over – finance minister Brian Lenihan, foreign minister Micheal Martin and tourism minister Mary Hanafin – challenged Cowen.
But a source said he will not lead the party into the Irish general election. Fianna Fail want a new leader to take them into the election in order to minimise losses at the polls, he said.
"He will stand down as party leader after the Finance Bill in February and there will be a two week campaign to get a new leader."
Fianna Fail are recording historically low results in successive opinion polls with the latest one by pollsters Red C giving the party just 14%. Party strategists believe a new leader would give Fianna Fail a fillip and a few extra percentage points in the election which is expected to be in March.
The meeting came after more details emerged of Cowen's dinner with former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Seán FitzPatrick at Druids Glen golf complex in County Wicklow in July 2008. Anglo is seen as one of the main culprits of the banking crisis and any association with its executives is damaging.
