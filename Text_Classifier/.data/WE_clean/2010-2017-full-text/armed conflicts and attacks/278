South Korean killed by North Korean mine - report
SEOUL (Reuters) - Mines suspected to have come from North Korea exploded after washing ashore on a South Korean beach, killing one man and injuring another, the South’s Yonhap News Agency reported on Sunday.
About 30 North Korean wooden box mines have been found in the last two days by the South Korean military on the country’s northwestern coast, Yonhap said. The area is near the South’s heavily fortified border with the North.
Warnings have been issued to South Koreans living near these beaches and the military have embarked on a search for mines.
Yonhap, quoting the South Korean military, said the two men had picked up two mines on a northwestern beach on Saturday night. The beach is normally restricted to military personnel as it is close to the heavily guarded border with North Korea, and it was unclear what the two men were doing there.
The North Korean mines may have been washed into South Korea by recent heavy flooding in North Korea, Yonhap said.
