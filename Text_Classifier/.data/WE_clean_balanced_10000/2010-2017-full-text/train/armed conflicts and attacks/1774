On Friday, the IDF deployed at least two Iron Dome anti-missile batteries in southern Israel, two days after three rockets were launched at Israel from the Gaza Strip.
One missile defense unit was stationed near the Mediterranean port city of Ashdod and another placed near the southern city of Netivot. Israelâ€™s Channel 10 also referred to a third battery stationed near Ashkelon.
Military sources said they were concerned that a Salafi terror group affiliated with Islamic State was threatening to fire on Israel amid a dispute with Hamas which has arrested some of its operatives.
