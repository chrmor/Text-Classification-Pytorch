Tornadoes, storms damage 150 homes in San Antonio
Residents in San Antonio were picking up the pieces Monday after severe overnight storms ripped through south-central Texas, damaging more than 150 homes.
The National Weather Service confirmed Monday that at least four six tornadoes hit San Antonio. Five minor injuries were reported, the Associated Press said.
At one point Sunday night, 46,000 customers were without power in the San Antonio area.
Thunderstorms and pounding rain rattled eastern Texas and southern Louisiana throughout the day and into Monday night. Fortunately, no severe thunderstorms are forecast anywhere in the U.S. on Tuesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.
A family of five said they hid under a mattress to stay safe from what they describe as tornado-like winds over their home Sunday night in San Antonio.
Homeowner Lucy Duncan said the family was watching TV as the storms were starting to pick up. "I couldn’t even describe it because I’ve never experienced it before,” Duncan told KENS-TV. “I knew immediately something was wrong.”
The storm ripped part of the roof from Duncan’s house. Duncan said the swing set and and outside structure in their backyard are both completely gone.
“We were acting on instinct,” Duncan said. “The reality is setting in now like, ‘Oh my goodness I can’t believe that happened,’ but in the moment we were just trying to survive.”
