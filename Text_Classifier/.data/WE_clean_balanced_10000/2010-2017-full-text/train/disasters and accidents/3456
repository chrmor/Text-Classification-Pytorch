Igor nearing Category 5
MIAMI, Sept. 12 (UPI) -- Big-shouldered Hurricane Igor kept getting stronger Sunday night, pumping out sustained winds of 150 mph far out in the Atlantic, U.S. storm watchers said.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Igor was intensifying just over 1,000 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands at 11 p.m. EDT. Igor, which was heading west at 13 mph, could become a Category 5 storm -- the most powerful level with winds of at least 156 mph -- Monday, the forecasters said.
Igor was still too far out to sea to necessitate coastal watches or warnings, the hurricane center said.
Igor was expected to turn toward the west-northwest and slow its forward progress Monday night into Tuesday.
Hurricane force winds are extending up to 40 miles out from Igor's eye and tropical storm force winds are reaching out up to 160 miles.
