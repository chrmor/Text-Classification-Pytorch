Russia's Medvedev opposed to U.N. vote on Syria: report
LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has practically ruled out supporting a United Nations resolution condemning Syria’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, the Financial Times reported Monday.
In an interview with the newspaper, Medvedev criticized the way Western countries had interpreted U.N. resolution 1973 on Libya which he said turned it into “a scrap of paper to cover up a pointless military operation.”
“I would not like a Syrian resolution to be pulled off in a similar manner,” he added.
Russia abstained in the March vote that cleared the way for military action in Libya to protect civilians. It has subsequently accused the coalition of overstepping its mandate.
Russia and fellow Security Council member China dislike the idea of any U.N. judgment on Syria and have played little part in discussions on a draft resolution.
“We will be told the resolution reads “denounce violence,” so some of the signatories may end up denouncing the violence by dispatching a number of bombers,” Medvedev was quoted as saying.
“In any event, I do not want it to be on my head.”
The main part of Medvedev’s interview with the newspaper was dedicated to domestic politics. He strongly hinted that he and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin would not run against each other for president in 2012.
