A blue moon is the occurrence of a second full moon in the same calendar month. What makes this blue moon special? 
The month of January had a blue moon, as well. When two blue moons happen in a row, it is called a "Double Blue Moon" and the last time this event occurred was in 1999. The next time a double blue moon will occur will be in 2037. Double blue moons happen about 3-5 times per century.  The consequence of a double blue moon, or the cause of it, depending on your perspective, is a February that doesn’t have a full moon. The lunar phase calendar takes 29.5 days to complete the cycle, which is why we roughly have one full moon per month. But since some months are 30 or 31 days long and February is shorter, we occasionally have a Full Moon-less February.
