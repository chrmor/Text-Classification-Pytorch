Supreme Court Gives Police More Leeway in Traffic Stop Case
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the use of evidence from a traffic stop even if police sometimes misunderstand the law when pulling over motorists, giving additional leeway for a routine police tactic.
Separately, the court declined to review an Arizona law limiting the use of abortion-inducing drugs. It left in place for now an injunction that blocks the state’s restrictions.
