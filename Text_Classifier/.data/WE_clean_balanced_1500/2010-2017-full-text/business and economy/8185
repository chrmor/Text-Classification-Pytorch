Late sell-off caps brutal quarter for dollar
The Australian dollar fell to its lowest since September 2010 after a round of selling that kicked off early in US trading on Friday caught some investors by surprise.
The dollar slumped more than 1.5 per cent to as low as 91.13 US cents and closed at 91.36 US cent after US Federal Reserve governor Jeremy Stein said the central bank may make a decision in September about tapering monetary stimulus.
The greenback strengthened against most major currencies on the back of his comments.
In late local trade on Friday the currency had been holding its own at 92.66 US cents, and off the 33-month trough of 91.48 US cents plumbed at the start of the week. Yet a couple of attempts to extend the bounce had faltered in the face of offers around 93.40 US cents.
The late sell-off in offshore trade capped a brutal quarter for the Aussie, during which it slumped 12.3 per cent against the greenback.
Also on Friday, the International Monetary Fund released data showing the dollar's share of central bank reserves edged higher in the first quarter of 2013. For the first time, the IMF broke down central bank holdings in the Australian and Canadian dollars, which were previously classified under "other currencies".
