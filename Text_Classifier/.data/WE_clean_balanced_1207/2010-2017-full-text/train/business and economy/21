Disneyland Paris shuts ride after accident -official
PARIS (Reuters) - The Disneyland Paris theme park closed its “Thunder Mountain” train ride on Monday after a piece of scenery fell onto one of the carriages and injured five people, one seriously, a state official told Reuters.
“A piece of scenery made from fibreglass and wood broke off and fell onto one of the carriages. There were 25 people on board,” said Thierry Bonnet, deputy prefect for the Seine-et-Marne region where the park is located.
The ride was closed but the rest of the park stayed open after the accident, he added.
A spokesman for the park’s operator, Euro Disney, did not return calls seeking comment. Disneyland Paris was France’s top attraction in 2009, bringing in 15.4 million visitors, according to the national statistics bureau INSEE.
