Judge stops NYC ban on large sugary drinks, city plans appeal
A state judge in New York on Monday invalidated the city's upcoming ban on sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in certain venues, a major setback for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has backed several laws aimed at New Yorkers' health.
The limit on the large drinks is "arbitrary and capricious," a New York State Supreme Court judge ruled Monday.
The measure was to take effect Tuesday, and Bloomberg's office said in a Twitter message that the city will appeal.
