ASEAN ministers arrive for Bali talks
Territorial disputes and flare-ups in the South China Sea are expected to dominate talks at Asia's largest security forum this week.
Foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations arrived at a tightly guarded five-star hotel in Bali for their annual get-together on Tuesday.
They will be joined later in the week by officials from the Asia-Pacific, Europe and the United States for the ASEAN Regional Forum.
Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd will be participating in talks on Thursday.
Other hot topics are expected to be the North Korean nuclear crisis and concerns about the slow pace of democratisation in military-dominated Burma.
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said in his opening statement that goals of the South-East Asian bloc include establishing a European-style economic community by 2015 and fighting threats like climate change and human trafficking.
