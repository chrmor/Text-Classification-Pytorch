Denmark and Russia agree to military cooperation
New military cooperation between Denmark and Russia, the first of its kind, was agreed upon in Moscow on Tuesday, reports Berlingske newspaper.
The agreement is the outcome of a meeting between Danish and Russian defence leaders in Moscow on Tuesday, attended by Gitte Lillelund Bech, the defence minister. It was the first time since 1993 that a Danish defence minister made an official visit to Moscow.
“With regard to piracy, missile defence and the Arctic region, it’s in our interest to have a close relationship with Russia, even though there are topics, like Georgia, where we disagree,” said Bech.
Bech met in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Anatolij Serjukov, to discuss military cooperation in the Baltic and Arctic, as well as shared interests in Afghanistan. 
The Danish-Russian agreement follows on the heels of a notable improvement in Russia’s dealings with Nato.  During the last summit, member countries agreed to a shared missile defence policy with Russia and closer collaboration in Afghanistan.
“We have a shared goal. If the Taliban were to rise to power in Afghanistan it would be a menace for Russia too,” said Bech.
The new cooperation agreement between Denmark and Russia includes plans for joint military exercises, exchange agreements and regular meetings with Russian navy leaders.
It was reached despite ongoing tensions between Denmark and Nato on the one side and Russia on the other, regarding Russia’s continued military presence in the separatist Georgian provinces.
