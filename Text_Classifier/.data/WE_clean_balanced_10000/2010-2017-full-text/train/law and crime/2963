Paris attacks suspect Abrini arrested
BRUSSELS - Mohamed Abrini, a 31-year-old Belgian wanted in connection with November's Islamic State attacks in Paris, has been arrested, Belgian public broadcaster VRT said on Friday.
He has been on Europe's most wanted list since being identified on CCTV video in a car with Salah al-Abdeslam, the recently arrested prime surviving suspect, two days before the Nov. 13 attacks in the French capital.
Abdeslam was arrested in Brussels two weeks ago, four days before Islamic State suicide bombers struck in the city.
