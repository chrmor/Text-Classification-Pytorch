Roche buys Brisbane drugmaker InterMune for $8.3 billion
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche is expanding its respiratory disease treatments by acquiring Brisbane drugmaker InterMune for $8.3 billion, the companies said Sunday.
Roche has agreed to acquire InterMune at $74 per share in an all-cash transaction, a price 38 percent higher than the company's $53.80 closing price on Friday.
The acquisition comes as InterMune is expected to win a long-coveted approval in the United States for pirfenidone, its medicine for the rare and fatal lung disease known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The disease has no known cause or cure and causes tissue deep in the lungs to become thick and scarred over time, making it hard to breathe. It affects about 128,100 people in the United States and kills about 40,000 people annually.
The drug is already approved in the European Union and Canada. But in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration rejected pirfenidone in 2010 because it did not show benefit in a study. After the company came back with positive data from a new trial in February, the FDA designated pirfenidone a breakthrough therapy in July and is expediting its review. The deadline for the agency's decision is Nov. 23. Wells Fargo Co. estimates the drug could surpass $1 billion in global revenue by 2019.
Roche already sells two medicines for respiratory diseases, Pulmozyme and Xolair. It was one of several companies rumored to be bidding on InterMune, including Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Actelion, Bloomberg has reported.
"This merger recognizes the significant value created by our team's commitment, hard work and execution for more than a decade to develop and commercialize treatment options for IPF patients and their families," InterMune Chairman and CEO Dan Welch said in a statement. "Roche shares our passion and commitment to the IPF community and to ensuring that pirfenidone is available as quickly as possible to patients in the United States, pending FDA approval."
Founded in 1998, InterMune had 392 employees as of July.
