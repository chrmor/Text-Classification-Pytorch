Seychelles' Michel wins 55 pct of presidential vote
VICTORIA, May 22 (Reuters) - Seychelles’ President James Michel won 55 percent of the vote in a presidential election the opposition said was marred by bribery, the Seychelles Electoral Commission said on Sunday.
The margin of Michel’s victory meant he avoided a second round run-off and won his second full term in office. (Reporting by George Thande; Writing by Richard Lough)
