3 civilians dead as ISIS mortar shells Mosul district
Nineveh (IraqiNews.com) Three civilians were killed on Thursday when a mortar missile landed on their homes in al-Bakr district in Mosul.
Shafaaq news website quoted a source as saying that three others were injured in the incident.
Iraqi forces and popular militias had liberated the district two days ago, but ISIS has been used to shell areas it lost to the forces, causing civilian deaths on some occasions.
Iraqi forces, assisted by popular militias and a US-led international coalition’s jets, continue to engage with ISIS militants in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, as part of a major campaign to force the extremist group out of Iraq.
In a related context, Abdul Wahab al-Saedi, a senior commander at the army’s anti-terrorism force, said his forces continue to clear several liberated areas from explosives planted by ISIS and comb the regions for any remaining ISIS elements.
A source told Shafaaq that the forces urged citizens through loudspeakers to remain at home.
