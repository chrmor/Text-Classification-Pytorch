Birmingham riots: Two charged with Winson Green murders
Two people have been charged with the murder of three men who were hit by a car while guarding shops from looters in Birmingham.
Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, died on Wednesday in Winson Green.
A 17-year-old male from Winson Green and Joshua Donald, 26, from Ladywood, have been charged with three counts of murder each.
The pair are due to appear before Birmingham magistrates on Sunday.
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said a 16-year-old boy and a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder had been bailed pending further inquiries.
Two other men aged 23 and 27 who were arrested on Friday remain in police custody.
Earlier, Tariq Jahan, father of Haroon Jahan, thanked people for their condolences.
"I have received much mail internationally," he said.
Mr Ali and Mr Musavir's uncle, Abdullah Khan, 58, said his nephews were "hard-working young men".
He said: "I remember talking to Shazad a few days before and he was looking forward to the birth of his first child in a few months, but that was not meant to be.
"We have lost two sons, which has left their family in complete shock and devastation."
A peace gathering has been arranged at Summerfield Park in Dudley Road, Birmingham, on Sunday at which the three men will be remembered.
