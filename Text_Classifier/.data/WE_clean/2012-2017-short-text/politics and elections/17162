South Korea announces that Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se will meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul Monday to work toward a final settlement concerning sex slavery during World War II. The Nikkei reports that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe plans to create a new government-backed fund, containing over 100 million yen (US$831,200/£556,600) to help former South Korean "comfort women," and is also considering making an apology for the wartime sexual enslavement.
