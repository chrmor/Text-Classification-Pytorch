Dozens killed in Ethiopia landslides, flooding amid rains
A state-affiliated broadcaster in Ethiopia says at least 50 people have been killed in flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rains.
Fana Broadcasting Corporate cited local officials who said roads have been washed away, bridges have collapsed and tens of thousands of people are affected by heavy rains in many parts of the country.
Alemayehu Mamo, a police official in the Wolaita Zone in southern Ethiopia, told Fana that 41 people were killed Monday following landslide there.
In another area called Bale, in southeastern Ethiopia, nine people died and more than 1,000 cattle drowned in floods.
Ethiopia is struggling with the worst drought in 50 years, but unseasonably heavy rain is also causing massive damage in many parts of the country.
