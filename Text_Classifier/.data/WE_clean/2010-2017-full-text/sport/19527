Japan gets go-ahead for Super Rugby
Japan has beaten Singapore as the preferred candidate for Super Rugby's 18th team when the competition expands in 2016, organisers said Friday.
A team from Japan will join the Kings from South Africa's Eastern Cape and a team based in Argentina when Super Rugby expands from its current 15 teams to 18 in 2016.
International Rugby Board chief Brett Gosper said earlier this year that he wanted Japan in because it would help build momentum for when the country hosts the Rugby World Cup in 2019.
"This week's meeting was a significant step in the evolution of Super Rugby," said Greg Peters, the chief executive of the sport's governing body SANZAR.
Peters said both Japan and Singapore had put forward compelling proposals in a competitive tender process and SANZAR looked forward to working with the Japanese Rugby Union to expand what has been a southern hemisphere competition.
