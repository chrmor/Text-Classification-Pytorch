Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives absorbs Family First
TONY Abbott has weighed in on Cory Bernardi’s recent expansion of his fledgling political party, after it merged with Family First.
Mr abbott told 2GB today that the last thing the Coalition needed was more “fringe parties on the right”.
He said he wanted to see a “united” party.
“The last thing we really need is more fringe parties on the right,” he said.
“We need a strong and united Liberal party.
“I want the Liberal party to be worth voting for.”
His comments come after Mr Bernardi has been expanding his fledgling political party of one by merging with Family First.
Sky News reported that Australian Conservatives, which Mr Bernardi launched after quitting the government’s ranks earlier this year, will absorb Family First.
The claim emerged on commentator Paul Murray’s show Paul Murray Live, which he described as a “political earthquake”.
Members of Family First in South Australia’s parliament will become Australian Conservative members, he reported.
They are Dennis Hood and Robert Brokenshire, who were elected to the state’s upper house in 2006 and 2008 respectively.
However Lucy Gichuhi, who scored a Senate seat in place of Bob Day, will not move. Instead, she will arrive in Canberra as an independent, Sky News reported.
Peta Credlin, who was chief of staff to former prime minister Tony Abbott, said the merge was “absolutely expected”.
It would give Mr Bernardi “the infrastructure he’ll need to be able to grow his brand”, Ms Credlin said.
A membership base and financial benefits will also boost the Australian Conservatives in the lead up to the next state and federal elections.
South Australia is due to go to the polls in less than a year. Mr Bernardi has flagged his intention to run a number of candidates in the state’s Upper House.
The Australian newspaper reports that a statement will be made on Wednesday announcing the political union.
Family First’s executives voted to dissolve the party and amalgamate with Australian Conservatives on Saturday, it reported.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who was a guest on Paul Murray Live when the news broke, said it was “inevitable”.
“When Bob Day exited the party, it was the case where the writing was on the wall,” Mr Dutton said.
“From the governments perspective, we will continue to work with minor parties and independents. We will work with them hopefully in a bid to get the budget back in balance.”
