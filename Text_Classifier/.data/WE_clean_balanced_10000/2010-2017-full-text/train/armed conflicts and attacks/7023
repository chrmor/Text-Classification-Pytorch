European airlines change Cairo flights due to curfew
LONDON (Reuters) - Some European airlines modified their schedules on Friday for flights to and from Egypt, cancelling some services, due to a curfew in Cairo.
British Airways postponed its daily flight from London to Cairo on Friday because it would have arrived during the night curfew imposed due to mass protests in the Egyptian capital, the airline said.
A “couple of hundred” passengers booked on the flight would stay in hotels until Saturday when it is expected to depart from London’s Heathrow airport, said a spokesman for BA, part of International Airlines Group.
BA plans to continue flying to Cairo but will adjust its schedules so that its flights arrive and depart from Cairo in daylight, the spokesman said. “We are keeping the situation in Cairo under constant review,” BA said in a statement.
The airline operates one return flight to Cairo per day.
BA’s operations to and from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh continue as normal, it said.
A Lufthansa spokesman said the German airline had cancelled one flight due to leave Cairo for Frankfurt at 4.50 am (2:50 a.m. British time) on Saturday morning because of the curfew.
Two flights are due to leave for Cairo on Saturday, from Frankfurt and from Munich. The spokesman said Lufthansa would make a decision on those flights on Saturday.
Air France has changed its schedule for flights to Cairo so that planes land and take off to avoid the curfew hours, a spokeswoman for the airline said. One flight was cancelled on Saturday but otherwise it was business as usual until further notice, she said.
