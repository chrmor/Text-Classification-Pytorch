(LEAD) Lee expected to make landmark visit to Dokdo
By Chang Jae-soon SEOUL, Aug. 10 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Myung-bak is expected to visit South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo on Friday, an unprecedented landmark trip that if realized, would unmistakably assert Seoul's sovereignty over the territory and could send diplomatic tensions with Tokyo soaring. Lee could visit the rocky outcroppings lying in the East Sea around halfway between the Korean Peninsula and Japan "if weather allows for" the trip after he visits the nearby Ulleung Island, a senior presidential official said on condition of anonymity.
