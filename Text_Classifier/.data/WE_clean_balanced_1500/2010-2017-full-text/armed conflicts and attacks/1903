U.S. Would Consider Extradition Request for Blamed Cleric
The United States would consider an extradition request for the Pennsylvania-based cleric blamed for the attempted military coup in Turkey, Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday.
In a televised speech, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the U.S. should extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who self-exiled from Turkey to the Poconos in 1999.
Erdogan and the Turkish government say Gulen is behind the clashes that broke out Friday night when the military attempted and failed to usurp the government. At least 194 people were killedin the turmoil.
But Gulen denied any involvement with the coup, telling reporters Saturday that he thinks it may have been "staged."
Erdogan has long accused Gulen, a former ally, of trying to overthrow the government. Washington has never found any evidence particularly compelling.
A Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Turkey "has been preparing a formal application with detailed information about Gulen's involvement in illegal activities. After last night, we have one more thing to add to an already extensive list."
Kerry told reporters Saturday, during a trip to Luxembourg, that such a request has not been received.
"We fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about Mr. Gulen," Kerry said, adding that the U.S. would act only if Turkey could prove wrongdoing on Gulen's part.
