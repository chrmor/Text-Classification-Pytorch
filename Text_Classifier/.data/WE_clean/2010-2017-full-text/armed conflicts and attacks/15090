Turkish capital Ankara hit by twin explosions
One person has been injured in explosions at Turkey's justice ministry and the headquarters of the governing AK Party in Ankara, officials say.
A rocket hit the seventh floor of the AK building, while two hand grenades were thrown at the ministry.
Earlier reports claimed two people had been wounded. No group has said it carried out the attacks.
Kurdish rebels, left-wing groups and Islamist militants have previously bombed targets in Turkey.
The explosion shattered windows on the seventh floor of the AK Party building where Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has an office.
Interior Minister Muammer Guler said no-one was injured in the attack on the party headquarters, while a person was wounded in the second assault.
They also come amid reports of a deal between the government and jailed Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
There is speculation that Mr Ocalan will call for a ceasefire between his PKK fighters and the Turkish state.
In a message communicated by Kurdish politicians, Mr Ocalan said he would make a "historic" announcement on Thursday, to coincide with Kurdish New Year celebrations.
The PKK launched its armed campaign for an ethnic Kurdish homeland in south-east Turkey in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
The group is regarded by Turkey, the US and the EU as a terrorist organisation.
