Assange case focuses on question of fair trial
LONDON: Julian Assange's defence team is to argue that he cannot be given a fair trial in Sweden because all rape cases are heard in secret - and justice cannot be seen to be done.
But senior legal sources in London have warned that the chances of success may be slim as 95 per cent of European arrest warrants, the legal tool that is being used to try to return the WikiLeaks founder to Sweden to face allegations of sex crimes, are eventually granted.
On the eve of the extradition hearing in London, the Herald was told that the crux of the defence team's argument was the open justice principle being a fundamental feature of the rule of law - and that unless justice could be seen to be done it could not be done at all.
Sweden's tradition of secret trials for sex offences will be placed under the microscope as will inconsistencies in the evidence provided to Swedish police by his accusers.
The two-day appeal against the warrant begins in Belmarsh Magistrates Court, London, today, just 48 hours after the police file, ostensibly provided in confidence to Mr Assange's legal team by the Swedes, was leaked online. It appears to raise questions for both sides on the case. It says the Swedish woman who accuses Mr Assange of rape woke up as he was having sex with her. She let him continue, it says, even though she knew he was not wearing a condom.
