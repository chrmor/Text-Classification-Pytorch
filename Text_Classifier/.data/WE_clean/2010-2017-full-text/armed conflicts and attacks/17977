Thailand's deep south has been rocked by a string of bomb attacks and brutal killings of Thai Buddhist women.
For two days the southern town of Yala has been hit by a series of explosions that have left one dead and dozens injured.
Sunai Phasuk, from Human Rights Watch, says since February at least five Thai Buddhist women have been killed and their bodies mutilated.
"These are the most horrific attacks on Buddhist women in years," he said.
Mr Phasuk says women are being killed to send a message that no-one will be spared.
Security has been beefed up amid fears further attacks could be planned ahead of a national holiday in Thailand this weekend.
It's believed separatist insurgents are responsible for the attacks in the majority Muslim area of the country.
