Thai clashes leave at least four dead as Prime Minister faces charges
Bangkok: Thailand’s anti-corruption commission announced it will charge Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra with neglect of duty as riot police and anti-government protesters clashed in Bangkok on Tuesday, leaving a policeman and three others dead and dozens injured.
The commission will summon Ms Yingluck to appear before it next week over her role in a controversial rice farm subsidy scheme that has cost Thailand billions of dollars.
If found guilty Ms Yingluck, Thailand’s first woman prime minister, could be removed from office.
Government officials say the commission’s action is part of what they see as a judicial coup orchestrated by powerful figures in Bangkok.
