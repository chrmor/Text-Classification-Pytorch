Cairo - Egyptian security officials say a bomb has exploded outside a branch of the French supermarket chain Carrefour in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, killing one person and wounding six.
The officials say the blast took place in Alexandria's eastern district of Seyouf.
It is the latest in a bombing campaign blamed on Islamic militants who are targeting foreign and local economic and financial establishments.
The attacks are designed to undermine confidence in Egypt ahead of a major economic conference later this week during which the government plans to announce projects worth up to $35bn.
