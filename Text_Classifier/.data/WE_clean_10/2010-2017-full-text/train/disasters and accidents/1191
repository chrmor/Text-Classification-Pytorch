12 killed in gas leak at China coal mine
A gas leak at a coal mine in northeast China has killed 12 miners, says state media.
The official Xinhua News Agency says the accident happened on Sunday at a mine in the Jilin Province city of Baishan.
Rescuers brought one injured person to a hospital and confirmed on Monday morning that the other 12 trapped miners were dead.
The cause of the accident in under investigation.
Carbon monoxide is typically the main component of noxious gases that leak from coal deposits, and they must be dispersed before poisoning miners or exploding.
China's mines had long been the world's deadliest, but safety improvements have reduced deaths in recent years.
