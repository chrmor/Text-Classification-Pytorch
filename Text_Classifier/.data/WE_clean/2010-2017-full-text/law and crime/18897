Finland Detains Vietnamese Missile Parts
HELSINKIâ€”Finland has detained a shipment of Vietnamese-owned air-to-air missile parts bound for Ukraine after raising concerns the consignment of military hardware violated arms-export regulations.
Finland's customs service discovered the missile parts last month in a shipment that lacked proper approvals for military equipment to transit through its country, Sami Rakshit, head of the enforcement department at Finnish customs, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday.
