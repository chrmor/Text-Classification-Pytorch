Madagascar's prime minister and cabinet resign
Madagascar’s president has accepted the resignation of Jean Ravelonarivo and his government
Madagascar’s prime minister has resigned along with his cabinet, an official at the president’s office said on Friday, without giving an explanation.
“The president has accepted the resignation of [the] prime minister and all members of the government ... The current members of the government are dealing with current business until the appointment of new members of the government,” Roger Ralala, secretary general of the presidency, said in a statement.
Jean Ravelonarivo, took became PM in January 2015 after public frustration with power cuts, rampant unemployment and a stagnant economy forced out the previous administration.
He survived a bid to sack him in July after the opposition group Mapar filed a censure motion, saying it was frustrated by the slow pace of change in the Indian Ocean island nation.
Madagascar has struggled to rebuild itself since a 2009 coup that scared off donors and foreign investment.
