Syrian Air Force Commander Is Reported Killed
Syria’s state television said Tuesday that insurgents had assassinated an air force commander in Damascus, as news accounts from antigovernment activists reported an intensified aerial bombing campaign against rebel targets, including the first warplane attack inside the Syrian capital since the conflict began 20 months ago.
The developments were reported a day after the expiration of a four-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha that had been widely and persistently violated. Each side accused the other of subverting the cease-fire, which was negotiated by the special Syria peace envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League, Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi had said he hoped it would form the basis for the beginning of dialogue between President Bashar al-Assad’s loyalists and his armed opponents.
An announcement carried on state television said the air force commander, Gen. Abdullah Mahmud al-Khalidi, was killed in the Damascus district of Rukn al-Din on Monday by armed terrorist groups, the government’s categorical term for its adversaries.
The announcement did not specify how the commander had been killed, but it described him as one of the country’s top aviation experts. Agence France-Presse, in a report from Damascus, quoted an unidentified security source as saying the commander had been shot to death while leaving a friend’s home.
The news agency also said that the Free Syrian Army, the main group of armed insurgents in Syria, had claimed responsibility for the assassination. But other unconfirmed reports from Syria raised the possibility the general had been killed by government agents to prevent him from defecting. Al Jazeera quoted unidentified activists as saying “the regime got rid of him before he does that.”
