Monte Paschi Exposure to Nomura Exceeds Regulatory Capital Limit
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA said its exposure to Nomura Holdings Inc exceeds the 25 percent limit on total capital imposed by regulators after losses last year reduced capital levels.
Monte Paschi’s exposure to Nomura was about 35 percent of its regulatory capital base at the end of 2014, Italy’s third-biggest bank said in a statement late Friday. The Siena-based lender has 9.9 billion euros ($10.5 billion) of capital, according to its 2014 annual report, implying a financial exposure to the Japanese lender of about 3.5 billion euros.
“The bank is reviewing all possible options to reduce the exposure within limits,” it said in the statement, following a request by market regulator Consob.
Ties to Nomura includes a 2009 transaction dubbed “Alexandria” that was allegedly used to hide losses from Monte Paschi accounts. The deal is currently under investigation by Milan prosecutors who suspect former officials at two banks of false accounting and market manipulation.
Monte Paschi had to restate its accounts in 2013 to reflect a loss that had allegedly been masked by the Nomura transaction and a similar deal with another lender. The bank, which has been bailed out twice by Italy, is now seeking to plug a 2.1 billion-euro capital gap that emerged in the European Central Bank’s health-check by raising 3 billion euros from investors.
The ECB gave an overall unfavorable assessment of Monte Paschi in its so-called SREP supervisory review earlier this year, the bank also said in the statement. The ECB cited the bank’s high credit risk related to bad loans, its difficulty of achieving adequate levels of profitability and inability to generate capital organically, as well as reputational and legal risks due to the involvement of the bank in various legal proceedings. Monte Paschi said the ECB has urged merger operations with other banks in addition to the approved capital increase in order to boost profitability and capital generation.
