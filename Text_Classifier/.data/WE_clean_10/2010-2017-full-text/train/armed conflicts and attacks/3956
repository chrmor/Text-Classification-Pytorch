Roadside bomb kills three NATO soldiers in Afghan south
KABUL (Reuters) - A roadside bomb killed three members of NATOâ€™s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday, the coalition said.
It is ISAF policy not to identify the nationality of soldiers killed on duty.
The Taliban on Sunday launched its spring offensive, saying it would take aim at foreign military bases and diplomatic areas.
