Grenada Names First Female Governor General, Cecile La Grenade
Grenada has named Dr Cecile La Grenade the country’s first-ever female Governor General, Prime Minister Dr Keith Mitchell announced in a national address Tuesday night.
“With more women in our Parliament than ever before, it is fitting that we’ll have our first female Governor-General,” Mitchell said. “It is also fitting that our appointment will come at a time when we are paying tribute to the country’s first female Governor, Dame Hilda Bynoe, who regrettably passed away this week.”
La Grenade, whom Mitchell called a “prominent successful businessperson and a prominent and successful Grenadian,” was awarded the OBE from Queen Elizabeth II for her work in managing Grenada-based De La Grenade Industries, a food processing company.
