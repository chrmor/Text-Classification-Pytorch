A moderate 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's North Maluku province, the meteorology and geophysics agency said, but no tsunami warning was issued.
The quake struck at 14:12 pm (local time), 198 kilometres south-east of Labuha at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the agency.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "ring of fire", where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity.
