MONTGOMERY, Ala. â€” A federal court Friday struck down Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage, saying it violated gay and lesbian couples' equal protection and due process rights.
In a 10-page decision, Callie V.S. Granade, a district judge for the U.S. Southern District of Alabama, wrote that the state had failed to prove any "rational, much less compelling" link between prohibiting same-sex marriage and having more children raised in "the biological family structure the state wishes to promote."
"The Attorney General does not explain how allowing or recognizing same-sex marriage between two consenting adults will prevent heterosexual parents or other biological kin from caring for their biological children," wrote Granade.
Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said in a statement Friday he would seek a stay of the ruling.
Granade enjoined Strange from enforcing the laws and did not put a stay on the decision as has happened in other states.
Alabama is the latest of numerous states where federal judges have ruled the bans unconstitutional.
Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement he was "disappointed" by the decision.
However, Democratic state Rep. Patricia Todd, the Legislature's only openly gay member, said she was "ecstatic" over the judge's decision.
"I guess I'm so used to so much bad news that's it's a little overwhelming," she said Friday evening.
The case, Searcy v. Strange, involved Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand, a same-sex couple who married in California and later moved to Alabama. The women wanted Searcy to adopt McKeand's 8-year-old son but were denied by the Mobile County Probate Court in 2011 under a 1998 law and 2006 constitutional amendment which banned both same-sex marriage ceremonies and recognition of out-of-state marriage between gay and lesbian couples.
Searcy and McKeand sued, saying the state provision violated their equal protection and due process rights under the 14th amendment. The state, citing a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld a Minnesota ban on same-sex marriage, argued that their rights had not been violated and that the state had a compelling interest in ensuring ties between children and their biological parents.
Alabama banned same-sex marriage by statute in 1998. In 2006, 81 percent of voters statewide approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. However, support for marriage equality has been rising in Alabama -- though not near a majority -- as the nation itself has become receptive to legal rights for gay and lesbian couples.
The U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage later this year.
