Gaza rocket hits southern Israel amid escalation
A rocket fired from Gaza hit southern Israel on Friday, the Israeli army said, although there were no reports of casualties or damage. “A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit the Eshkol area in southern Israel,” said the spokesman for the army, adding that it was the first rocket to strike Israeli territory since Sept. 16. The spokesman did not say how the Israelis would respond despite the rocket being fired during a ceasefire put in place since Operation Protective Edge, launched in the summer by Israel against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire on August 26, brokered by Egypt, ending 50 days of war which resulted in the deaths of 2,140 Palestinians and 73 Israelis, most of them from the army. Both sides are expected to resume talks soon in Cairo as part of an effort to keep the ceasefire in place.
