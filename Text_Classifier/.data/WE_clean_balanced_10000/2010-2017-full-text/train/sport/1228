Gael Givet suffers health scare?
Gael Givet suffers a reported health scare, delaying the restart of Blackburn's match with Wigan at Ewood Park.
The second half of tonight's Premier League tie between Blackburn Rovers and Wigan Athletic was delayed as Gael Givet suffered a further health scare.
Blackburn's French defender had been troubled with a heart problem several weeks ago and there was cause for concern when he complained of a similar issue during the break at Ewood Park.
He was immediately taken to the medical facility on site, where he was treated by physios and paramedics.
Players from both sides were kept in the tunnel while Givet was seen to, but the action resumed shortly after the scheduled restart when it was revealed that he was in a stable condition.
Givet later re-emerged to take his place alongside his teammates on the Rovers bench.
The two teams, both fighting for their Premier League status, went into the break goalless. Read the full report here.
