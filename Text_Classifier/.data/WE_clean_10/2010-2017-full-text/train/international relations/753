9 N. Korean defectors set to arrive in Seoul
SEOUL, Oct. 4 (Yonhap) -- A group of nine North Korean defectors who have been under protective custody in Japan for nearly three weeks is set to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday by air, a foreign ministry official in Seoul said. The North Koreans -- six adults and three children -- were found drifting aboard a small wooden boat off Japan's west coast on Sept. 13, in a rare sea defection from the North to Japan.
