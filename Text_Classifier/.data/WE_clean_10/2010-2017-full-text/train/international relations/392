Azerbaijani FM calls Iranian accusations ‘slander’
Azerbaijan considers the note of the Iranian Foreign Ministry as a response to the note previously presented to the Iranian side by official Baku, spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry Elman Abdullayev told Trend on Monday.
"The information contained in the note is false, it is a kind of slander," Mr Abdullayev said. "Azerbaijan is a country which itself suffers from terror".
He noted Azerbaijan will never allow using its territory for aiding terrorism.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Azerbaijani ambassador to the Islamic republic on Saturday to accuse Baku of aiding the Israeli intelligence service in killing of the Iranian nuclear scientist, Reuters reported with reference to the local mass media outlets.
Unfortunately, this situation became a negative moment in the Iranian-Azerbaijan relations, Mr Abdullayev said. He added Azerbaijan stands for good neighbourly relations with Iran.
In mid-January the Ministry of National Security prevented the terror act. Its implementation was planned in Baku.
As a result of investigation and search operations the ministry exposed and detained a group of people, linked to the Iranian intelligence service, who are accused of preparation for attempt on public figure's life to stop his activities, i.e. of organization of terror act, purchase of big number of firearms, ammunition, explosives, equipment and other crimes.
