Barcelona tackle PSG, Bayern meet Juventus
Paris Saint-Germain FC striker Zlatan Ibrahimović will renew acquaintances with former club FC Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals following the draw in Nyon today.
Ties take place on 2/3 and 9/10 April.
Ibrahimović – scorer of 21 goals in his sole season with the Blaugrana, 2009/10 – will return to the Camp Nou for the second leg on 10 April. PSG are among Europe's elite eight clubs for the first time since 1995, when they defeated Barcelona 3-2 on aggregate at this juncture before losing to AC Milan in the semi-finals.
Barcelona's Liga rivals, nine-time European champions Madrid, were paired with Galatasaray AŞ in what will be an emotive tie for ex-Merengues players Hamit Altıntop and Wesley Sneijder. The Istanbul outfit will hope for a different outcome from that of the teams' last meeting in 2001, the last time Cimbom graced this stage. On that occasion, Madrid overturned a 3-2 first-leg deficit with a 3-0 home victory in the return.
Serie A leaders Juventus, meanwhile, will tackle 2012 runners-up FC Bayern München. The clubs last encountered one another in the group stage three seasons ago, the German side following up a goalless draw in Bavaria by triumphing 4-1 in Turin on matchday six.
Debutants Málaga CF, the first team drawn by final ambassador Steve McManaman, will play Borussia Dortmund.
