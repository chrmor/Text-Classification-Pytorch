Kurds’ Hopes for Peace Fade as Ruling Party Wins Turkish Election
DIYARBAKIR, Turkey—Angry young Kurds clashed with police here in the de facto capital of the country’s Kurdish southeast as it became evident on Sunday that the party backing President Recep Tayyip Erdoganwould regain its lock on power.
Young men set up barricades and fired bullets into the air, accusing the government of fraud. Police fired tear gas and water cannons to disburse the activists as Kurdish hopes of expanding their political clout suffered another setback.
