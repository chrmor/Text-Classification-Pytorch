NATO foreign ministers agree to extend Afghan mission
BRUSSELS (AP) â€” NATO foreign ministers and alliance partners have agreed to extend the Resolute Support mission that trains, advises and assists Afghanistan's security forces and institutions beyond 2016.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference Friday that military planners now will work out details of the prolonged mission, including the regions of Afghanistan affected.
Stoltenberg said ministers also reviewed international financial support for the Afghan army and police. NATO officials hope that by July, they will have sufficient financial commitments locked in through the year 2020. The previous round of pledges expires in 2017.

British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said his country has decided to keep contributing 70 million pounds ($102 million) yearly through 2020. He said Britain hopes its example will inspire others to keep donating.
