Zimbabwe crisis deepens as social media adds to Robert Mugabe’s woes 
As their country is sucked into a the depths of a new economic crisis, Zimbabweans are beginning to run out of patience.
“We can’t get jobs. And if we have jobs, we can’t get our money out of the bank,” said Evan Mawarire, who ran the social media campaign that inspired a rare general strike last Wednesday.
After 36 years of rule by president Robert Mugabe, the country is again on the brink of collapse. 
The regime has run out of funds, leaving it unable to pay civil servants, teachers or policemen.
In the past the Reserve Bank would have printed more money, but since 2009 the country has used the US dollar as its currency.
