Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball Breaks Record for VEVO's Most-Viewed Video
If Miley Cyrus is twerkin', we're talkin'. And if she's crying and swinging naked on a wrecking ball, you better believe we're watching!
So it makes sense that Miley's "Wrecking Ball" music video (which premiered Monday, Sept. 9) broke VEVO's record for the most -viewed clipâ€”receiving some 19 million views in its first 24 hours.
"Wrecking Ball has officially beat the @VEVO record," the 20-year-old Queen of Twerk tweeted. "thank you smilerzzzzz."
