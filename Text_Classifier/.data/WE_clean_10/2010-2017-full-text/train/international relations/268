WikiLeaks proves classic diplomacy not helpful
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said during a meeting with Israeli ambassadors on Sunday that in the WikiLeaks era classic diplomacy is not helpful. He added the leaks prove the right diplomacy is to say things "as is".
Lieberman attacked Turkish Foreign Minister who said on Saturday that Israel would have delayed its aid to his country. "I heard all of the Turkish minister's lies. I want to remind him that we flew aid delegations to Turkey during the earthquake, and if God forbid a national disaster was to occur in the county â€“ we would fly there, no political questions asked, just to save lives."
