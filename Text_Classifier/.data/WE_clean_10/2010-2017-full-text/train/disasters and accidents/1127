Miraculous survival amid floods tragedy
Thousands of homes in Ipswich and Brisbane have been completely submerged as the Queensland capital is devastated by floodwaters.
As the death toll rose to 12, authorities hailed the miraculous survival of two people all but given up for lost after being swept away by raging floodwaters.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the situation was very grim in Brisbane and Ipswich to the west.
"We are now in the grip of a very serious natural disaster," she said on Wednesday night.
"We are now seeing thousands of homes inundated with water up to the roof.
"Many many more are expecting to see significant water damage."
