Gunman Kills 13 People in Serbian Village
WARSAW — A 60-year-old man went on a shooting rampage in a village near Belgrade, Serbia, early Tuesday, killing 13 people, including his son, his mother and a 2-year-old child, before attempting suicide, Serbian police officials and news reports said.
The police and the Serbian news media said the man, identified as Ljubisa Bogdanovic, used a handgun to kill six men, six women and the child, whose parents were among the dead. The Serbian police director, Milorad Veljovic, said the gunman’s motive was not immediately known. Mr. Bogdanovic lost his job last year, the news media reported, and he was a veteran of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, having fought in Croatia in 1992.
The killings took place between 5 and 5:30 a.m. in the sleepy village of Velika Ivanca, 30 miles southeast of Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Police officials said Mr. Bogdanovic first shot his 42-year-old son and his mother, then left his home and went from house to house, where he killed several of his neighbors and relatives, some of whom were sleeping. The police said the neighbors in the close-knit village had left their doors unlocked and all were shot in the head.
The Serbian prime minister, Ivica Dacic, said the killings would spur a new focus on gun control laws. The Serbian government held an emergency session on Tuesday and was expected to declare a day of national mourning.
Sreten Despotovic, a neighbor, told Kurir, a daily Serbian newspaper, that Mr. Bogdanovic kicked down the door of his family’s house and killed Mr. Despotovic’s brother as well as a grandchild, who was sleeping. He said Mr. Bogdanovic’s father hanged himself several years ago.
