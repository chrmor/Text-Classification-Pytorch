Phone Hacking: The Sun's website 'hacked by LulzSec' with fake story about Rupert Murdoch's death
The hacking group LulzSec took credit for the attack on Twitter, saying: "We have owned Sun/News of the World".
Viewers of the tabloid website were redirected to a mocked up news story with the headline "Media moguls body discoverd [sic]".
The story continued: "Murdoch, aged 80, has said to have ingested a large quantity of palladium before stumbling into his famous topiary garden late last night, passing out in the early hours of the morning."
The website later redirected to the Lulzsec Twitter feed, where the anonymous group crowed: "We have joy we have fun, we have messed up Murdoch's Sun".
The group is believed to have been responsible for bringing down the websites of the CIA, the US Senate and Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency.
Last month, 19-year-old Ryan Cleary was arrested at his home in Essex on suspicion of being involved in the group, which is being investigated by both the FBI and the Metropolitan Police.
On Twitter, LulzSec also claimed to have hacked into News International email accounts and began posting what appeared to be passwords to individual email addresses as well as mobile numbers for editorial staff.
There were some indications that the information accessed may have been several years old.
One tweet mentioned a Sun email address for Rebekah Wade - the unmarried name of Rebekah Brooks, News International's chief executive.
Mrs Brooks has used her married name since 2009 and she left the The Sun to become a News International executive the same year.
It also posted a mobile number for Pete Picton, a former Sun online editor who left the paper last year.
LulzSec said it was "battling" with administrators from News International, who were struggling to regain control of the website.
News International could not be reached for comment.
