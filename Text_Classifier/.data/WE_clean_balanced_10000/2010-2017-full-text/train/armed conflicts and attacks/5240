Policeman shot dead by a conscript during work argument in Cairo's Garden City
A low ranking police officer was shot dead and another injured by a police conscript on Tuesday when a work-related argument turned violent in Cairo’s upscale Garden City neighbourhood.
In a statement on its Facebook page, the ministry of interior said the conscript—deployed as part the Central Security Forces securing foreign embassies in the area—suffered from a "bad psychological state" resulting from a work feud with the officers.
The ministry said that one of the officers insulted the conscript and threatened to write him up for administrative violations, which could have deprived him of his monthly leave.
The statement added that the conscript has been detained and the prosecution is conducting investigations.
The Central Security Forces, which falls under the authority of the ministry of interior, uses thousands of army conscripts, who have low levels of educational attainment, for police work in 3-year mandatory service.
