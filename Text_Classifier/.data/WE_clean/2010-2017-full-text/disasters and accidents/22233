Blasts Rock Chinese City of Tianjin, At Least 17 Reported Killed
Powerful explosions rocked the Chinese port city of Tianjin on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, officials and state media said.
Nine firefighters were killed, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. It is not clear if the nine were counted among the 17 dead. The broadcaster reported that 283 people are in the hospital, and 32 people are in critical condition.
Xinhua, the state news agency, reported that the blast occurred at around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday at a warehouse storing "dangerous goods" and that the explosion and fire touched off other blasts nearby. Local media reported that the strongest was the equivalent of 21 tons of TNT.
Windows in buildings more than a mile away were blown out by the force of the blast. A fireball appears to have swept through a parking lot of 1,000 new Renault cars, with the paint burned off and the cars left charred. Videos posted on social media showed great flashes of light in the night sky.
