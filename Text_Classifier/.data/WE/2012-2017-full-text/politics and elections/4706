US warns Americans of travel risks in Algeria
The State Department is warning American citizens about the risks of travel to Algeria and is authorizing the families of State Department staff to leave the country if they choose.
The warning comes after the Algerian government reported that special forces stormed a natural gas complex in the Sahara desert to end a standoff with Islamist extremists. Algerian officials say at least 23 hostages and all 32 militants involved were killed.
In its travel warning Saturday night, the State Department cites credible threats of the kidnapping of Western nationals and says there is a high threat of terrorism and kidnappings in Algeria.
