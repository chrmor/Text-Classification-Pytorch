Dannii Minogue quits as judge on The X Factor
Dannii Minogue is standing down as a judge on The X Factor.
The 39-year-old Australian singer quit the ITV talent contest just days before the new series is due to launch.
She put the decision down to a clash with her commitments as a judge on Australia's Got Talent.
Her departure from X Factor fuels more speculation about the make-up of the panel, after the decision by Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole to appear as judges on the US version of the show.
Minogue joined the show in 2007 and mentored two winners, Matt Cardle and Leon Jackson.
She confirmed her decision to leave by posting a link through to the website mydaily.co.uk, for which she is a contributing editor, via her Twitter page.
She said: "I am so disappointed that I can't be a part of The X Factor this year.
"I'm going to miss the show and the amazing team who work so incredibly hard on it."
She added: "During discussions for me to return [to The X Factor] it became clear that unfortunately, this year, the X Factor audition dates in the UK clash with the live shows of Australia's Got Talent during June and July.
"For this reason I am unable to return."
There has been media speculation that Louis Walsh will return to the UK judging panel and Lily Allen, Gary Barlow, Melanie B, Ozzy Osbourne and Tulisa Contostavlos, from the band N-Dubz, have all also been linked to the show.
