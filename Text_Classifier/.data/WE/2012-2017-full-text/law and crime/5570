Mississippi State Rep. Jessica Upshaw found dead
Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain says the crime scene unit is at a home in Mendenhall, investigating her death.
Neither Strain nor Tutor would comment about the cause of death. Strain says it does not appear to be a natural death. The Clarion-Ledger reportsthe lawmaker died from a gunshot wound to the head, citing state Capitol sources.
Simpson County Sheriff Kenneth Lewis tells The Clarion-Ledger that she was found at the home of former Mississippi State Rep. Clint Rotenberry, who has not been arrested.
"We can't really call what happened yet. I don't know if it's a suicide or what," Lewis told the paper.
Tutor would not confirm that. Rotenberry did not answer his phone, and his answering machine was full.
House Minority Leader Bobby Moak describes her as a passionate champion of causes for her district and the state.
