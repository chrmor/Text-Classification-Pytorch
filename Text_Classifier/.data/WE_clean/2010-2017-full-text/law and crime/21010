2 Mass. high schools close Monday due to bomb threats
Two Massachusetts high schools closed Monday after they received bomb threats, officials said.
The latest incident marks the third bomb threat Brockton High School has received this school year, Brockton school officials said.
Police were searching the building Monday, and classes were expected to resume Tuesday, school officials said.
Whitman-Hanson Regional High School also closed after the school received a threatening e-mail Monday morning, Superintendent Ruth C. Gilbert-Whitner said in a statement.
“Due to the timing of the receipt of the e-mail and the scope of the investigation, classes at the high school only have been canceled,” she said. “The police were notified immediately and responded to the building.”
Buses for all Whitman-Hanson Regional schools were searched Monday morning before leaving to pick up students, the statement said.
