New York Daily News: Ukrainian politicians get into fistfight during heated parliament session - Mar. 20, 2013
A Ukrainian parliament session in Kiev morphed into a fistfight on Tuesday as men in suits threw punches after a leading politician decided to give a speech in Russian.
Parliamentary leader Olexander Yefremov reportedly called his opponents “neo-fascists” after they started booing. The hot-blooded lawmakers can be seen jumping out of their seats and squaring off face-to-face in the aisles.
