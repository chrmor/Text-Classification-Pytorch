Belgorod: Six dead in western Russia shooting
A gunman has killed six people - including a 14-year-old girl - in the western Russian city of Belgorod, local officials say.
The man shot dead three people inside a hunting shop and two passers-by. Another woman later died in hospital.
The attacker - said to be an ex-convict - then fled in a car, and the abandoned vehicle, a BMW, was found later.
The motive is believed to be robbery. The city authorities have declared Tuesday a day of mourning.
The shooting began at about 14:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in the shop in the city centre.
Russian news agencies later posted photos of the bodies lying on the street near the Okhota (Hunt) shop and a crowd of onlookers gathered nearby.
Local media are also quoting Belgorod police as saying the gunman is a 31-year-old city resident who was released from prison last year.
Some reports in the Russian media also suggest there may have been two gunmen.
The police say they are still hunting for the suspect, who is believed to be hiding at a local car market, despite an earlier statement by the city authorities that he had been arrested.
