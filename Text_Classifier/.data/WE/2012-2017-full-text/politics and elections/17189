Border Patrol union endorses Donald Trump
A U.S. Border Patrol agents' union is endorsing Donald Trump for president, offering the Republican front-runner support on his signature issue of immigration while praising him as a break from the current political system.
The National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents 16,500 agents, made its first-ever endorsement in a presidential election, touting Trump in a letter as a break from "the perfect Washington-approved tone."
"We need a person in the White House who doesn't fear the media, who doesn't embrace political correctness, who doesn't need the money, who is familiar with success, who won't bow to foreign dictators, who is pro-military and values law enforcement, and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations. Donald Trump is such a man," the union said.
Trump had scheduled a tour of the border with agents from a local chapter of the union, but that tour was canceled due to pressure from the group's national headquarters. Yet the endorsement, which Trump's campaign touted Wednesday, came from the national union.
The Border Patrol union said Trump's list of opponents includes "all the people responsible for the problems plaguing America today," while Trump has backing from workers and law enforcement officers.
"Mr. Trump will take on special interests and embrace the ideas of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management yes-men who say whatever they are programmed to say. This is a refreshing change that we have not seen before -- and may never see again," the union said. In a statement In a statement , Trump called himself "deeply privileged" to get the union's endorsement. "This endorsement represents a total rejection of the corrupt politicians who have allowed transnational gangs and cartels to terrorize American communities," he said.
