"(I)investors with a shorter time horizon may need to brace for some pain and even cut losses following the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. debt," writes CNBC's Jeff Cox. "But those with a longer time horizon can likely stand pat."
The stage was set by S&P's decision on Friday to downgrade the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner went on damage-control duty over the weekend, saying S&P has shown "really terrible judgment and they've handled themselves very poorly."
In an interview with CNBC, the secretary said the agency drawn "exactly the wrong conclusion" from last week's budget agreement and shown a "stunning lack of knowledge about basic U.S. fiscal budget math."
