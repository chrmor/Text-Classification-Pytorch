Dutch journalist Jeroen Oerlemans 'killed by Isis sniper' in Libya
A Dutch journalist has been killed while covering a government-backed offensive against the Isis jihadist group in the city of Sirte, a medical official has said.
Photojournalist Jeroen Oerlemans was shot in the chest by an Isis militant, according to the AFP news agency.
Dr Akram Gliwan, spokesman for a hospital in Misrata where pro-government fighters are treated, said the photographer was “shot in the chest by an IS sniper while covering battles in Sirte,” 280 miles east of Tripoli.
Mr Gliwan added that his body had been transferred to Misrata, 200 kilometres west of Isis’s Libyan stronghold of Sirte.
Mr Oerlemans had been working in Libya for a number of organisations, including the Belgian weekly Knack magazine, which confirmed his death.
A message posted on Knack's website said Mr Oerlemans was shot on a reporting assignment and that the publication “wishes his family much strength”.
Forces allied with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord launched an assault against the jihadist bastion in May.
The Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous media office revealed its forces lost eight fighters in the fight against Isis militants Sunday, in addition to more than 50 injuries, according to the Libyan Express.
The report also stated that 10 Isis terrorists were also killed in Sunday attacks.
Isis took control of Sirte – Gaddafi's hometown – last year. The militant group turned the city into its North African stronghold, extending its control along Libya's coastline.
A recent report by the UK’s Foreign Affairs Committee claimed Britain’s intervention in Libya and the chaos and bloodshed that ensued sparked helped strengthen Isis and al-Qaeda, as well as fuelling conflicts across Africa and the Middle East.
The scathing report held David Cameron “ultimately responsible” for failing to stabilise Libya after the death of Muammar Gaddafi.
