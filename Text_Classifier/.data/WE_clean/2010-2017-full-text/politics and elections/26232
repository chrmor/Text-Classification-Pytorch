Jeremy Corbyn insists 'Labour has no anti-Semitism problem' and suggests critics 'nervous' of his power as party suspends Ken Livingstone
Jeremy Corbyn denied that his party has a “problem” with anti-Semitism after Ken Livingstone was accused of being a “disgusting Nazi apologist” by a fellow Labour MP.
In a day of unprecedented turmoil, the Labour leader suspended Mr Livingstone after he invoked Hitler to defend a colleague over anti-Semitic remarks and claimed that there was a “well-orchestrated campaign” against the party by the “Israel lobby”.
