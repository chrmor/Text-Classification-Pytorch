MLB All-Star Game 2012: NL Wins 8-0
The National League came of the gates swinging and never really stopped in an easy 8-0 victory over the American League in the 2012 All Star Game.
Justin Verlander got beat around in the first inning and the final daggers were placed in the fourth as the San Francisco Giants enlisted a few other National Leaguers to help them in the victory. Pablo Sandoval hit a bases loaded triple in the first inning to help tag Verlander for five runs in the first inning, and Melky Cabrera launched a two run home run off of Matt Harrison in the fourth to emphasize the fact.
Wade Miley pitched to start the ninth inning, giving up a single to Joe Mauer and retiring Elvis Andrus before leaving the mound.
Bryce Harper didn't have an All-Star game really worth remembering. He reached base on a walk and showed aggression in tagging from first to second on a long fly ball to center. But Harper got caught in a run down on the subsequent at bat, and then lost a ball in the sun in left field later in the next inning.
The American League threatened a couple of times with a bases load situation in the fifth and two men on in the sixth but couldn't capitalize against the National League pitching. It is the third straight All-Star Game victory for the National League.
