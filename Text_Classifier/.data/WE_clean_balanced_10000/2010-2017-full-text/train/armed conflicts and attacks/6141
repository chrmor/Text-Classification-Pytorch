Match between Israel's Maccabi Haifa, France's Lille disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters
A football match in Austria between Israeli team Maccabi Haifa and French side Lille has been disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.
Salzburg police said the pre-season friendly in the town of Bischofshofen was interrupted shortly before the end when protesters waving Palestinian flags stormed the pitch and confronted Maccabi players.
The Jerusalem Post reported that punches were thrown as security were slow to react before escorting the protestors out of the stadium.
Police said nobody was injured. The referee broke off the game after the incident in the 85th minute.
