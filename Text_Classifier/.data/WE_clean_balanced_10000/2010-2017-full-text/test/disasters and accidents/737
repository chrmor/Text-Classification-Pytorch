CAMEO Chemicals
A solid alloy of iron and silicon. Used to add silicon to iron and steel. Ferrosilicon is an odorless, crystalline solid metal. It is flammable and can react explosively with oxidizing materials. In the presence of moisture or water it may emit toxic and explosive fumes. It is used in magnesium processing.
Flammable. Reacts with water or moisture in the air to form flammable hydrogen gas. The heat created by the reaction may be sufficient to ignite the hydrogen generated.
Metals, such as FERROSILICON, are reducing agents and tend to react with oxidizing agents. Their reactivity is strongly influenced by their state of subdivision: in bulk they often resist chemical combination; in powdered form they may react very rapidly. Thus, as a bulk metal it is somewhat unreactive, but finely divided material may be pyrophoric. The metal reacts exothermically with compounds having active hydrogen atoms (such as acids and water) to form flammable hydrogen gas and caustic products. The reactions are less vigorous than the similar reactions of alkali metals, but the released heat can still ignite the released hydrogen. Materials in this group may react with azo/diazo compounds to form explosive products. These metals and the products of their corrosion by air and water can catalyze polymerization reactions in several classes of organic compounds; these polymerizations sometimes proceed rapidly or even explosively. Some metals in this group form explosive products with halogenated hydrocarbons.
ERG Guide 139 Excerpt from ERG Guide 139 [Substances - Water-Reactive (Emitting Flammable and Toxic Gases)]: As an immediate precautionary measure, isolate spill or leak area in all directions for at least 50 meters (150 feet) for liquids and at least 25 meters (75 feet) for solids. SPILL: Increase, in the downwind direction, as necessary, the isolation distance shown above. FIRE: If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 800 meters (1/2 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 800 meters (1/2 mile) in all directions.

ERG Guide 139 Excerpt from ERG Guide 139 [Substances - Water-Reactive (Emitting Flammable and Toxic Gases)]: Fully encapsulating, vapor-protective clothing should be worn for spills and leaks with no fire. ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. DO NOT GET WATER on spilled substance or inside containers. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. FOR CHLOROSILANES, use AFFF alcohol-resistant medium-expansion foam to reduce vapors. SMALL SPILL: Cover with DRY earth, DRY sand or other non-combustible material followed with plastic sheet to minimize spreading or contact with rain. Dike for later disposal; do not apply water unless directed to do so. POWDER SPILL: Cover powder spill with plastic sheet or tarp to minimize spreading and keep powder dry. DO NOT CLEAN-UP OR DISPOSE OF, EXCEPT UNDER SUPERVISION OF A SPECIALIST. (ERG, 2016)
Get medical attention. INHALATION: Remove to fresh air. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. EYES: Flush with water for at least 15 min., lifting lids occasionally. SKIN: Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Flush with water. (USCG, 1999)
