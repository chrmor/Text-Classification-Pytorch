TEHRAN (FNA)- The Israeli Ofer military court extended the detention of a wounded Palestinian teenage girl for eight days, the Palestinian Committee of Prisoners’ Affairs said in a statement.
Head of the committee Issa Qaraqe, said that the court extended 16-year-old Fatima Jibrin Taqatqa’s detention in absentia, pointing out that she remains in critical condition under anesthetics and on respirators at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Ma'an reported.
Taqatqa was shot and injured by Israeli forces on Wednesday at a junction near the illegal Israeli settlement bloc of Gush Etzion in the Suthern occupied West Bank Bethlehem district, after Israeli authorities alleged that the teen was attempting to carry out a vehicular attack.
The exact nature of her injuries remained unclear.
The Israeli army told Ma’an at the time that no Israelis had been injured in the incident.
Security camera footage of the events showed Taqatqa’s car seemingly losing control at the junction, going over a median strip, and hitting posts near a bus station.
According to Ma'an estimates, 13 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed at the Gush Etzion junction since a wave of unrest first erupted across the occupied Palestinian territory in October 2015.
