Almost 100,000 children starving in Yemen's al-Hodeidah
The UN children's agency says 96,000 children are starving and close to death in the port city of al-Hodeidah.
It estimates nearly 8,000 children will suffer from severe malnutrition in the southern port city of Aden in the next year.
Already, almost two million children across the country do not have enough food or water. And the fighting is escalating in the capital, Sanaa, as the Saudi-led coalition steps up its bombardment.
