Cars submerged under water as high spring tides bring flooding to south-west London
High tides on the River Thames left cars submerged under several feet of water in west London today.
Flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency for riverside properties over the weekend amid warnings due to exceptionally high tides on the Thames.
And burst river banks at Richmond left cars submerged under floodwater on Friday afternoon.
Warnings were also in place for parts of Twickenham, Chiswick and Bermondsey.
Thames Barrier operators earlier warned of "very high tides" on Friday afternoon and Saturday.
In spring last year, high tides at Richmond saw a luxury yacht crash into a bridge due to rapidly rising water levels.
The Thames Barrier is expected to fit to protect London form flooding until around 2050, according to the Environment Agency.
Last winter, the barrier was closed a record-breaking 50 times between December 2013 and the end of February 2014 as parts of the south-east were hit by severe flooding.
