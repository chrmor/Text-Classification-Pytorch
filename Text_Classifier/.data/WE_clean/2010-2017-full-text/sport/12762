Arsenal stage stunning comeback from four goals down to beat Reading 7-5 after extra time
This was one of the epic cup ties, an emotion-shredder of a match that saw the Mad Stad live up to its nickname as Arsenal amazingly recovered from 4-0 down to reach the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup. Extra-time, extraordinary tie.
After a weekend when the sport endured further turmoil with Chelsea’s allegations against Mark Clattenburg, this game was a welcome breath of fresh air, a reminder of the sport’s intoxicating qualities. It was the type of night that will have had a television audience bewitched.
It was the type of comeback that had Arsenal fans looking at each other in disbelief and delight. Many will be hoarse this morning, having sung in anger and joy.
With Arsenal 4-0 down after 40 minutes, and their defence as solid as a blancmange, the visiting fans were chanting “we want our money back”. By the end, with their team playing 4-2-4, with Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud immense and even Marouane Chamakh looking threatening, Arsenal fans left with priceless memories.
As the years pass, they will always recall events of last night. This is what following a team is all about, the ambushing of the emotions, the lows and the highs, the sublime replacing the ridiculous. The game has to be about the glory, about chasing trophies rather than simply keeping the accountants happy by finishing fourth and securing entry to the Champions League.
Arsène Wenger made 11 changes, indicating that he was not taking the Capital One Cup that seriously, but it remains a competition that offers a route up Wembley Way. It offers a chance of silverware, something that Arsenal fans crave. It is worth fighting for.
And they did. Gone was the incompetence of the early stages, replaced by a resilience, a pride in the shirt and a cutting edge. The key was Walcott, who demonstrated why he is worth a new contract – and a run through the middle. Even at 4-0 down, even with his fellow strikers Chamakh and Andrei Arshavin resembling statues, Walcott kept running, kept believing, kept threatening. His goal just before the break gave Arsenal hope.
Until then, Arsenal had been a shambles. Their defending was shocking, two experienced centre-halves in Laurent Koscielny and Johan Djourou proving so weak in the air. The watching Tony Adams and Martin Keown could have done better — even at 46.
What must have shocked Arsenal fans is that there was sufficient quality in their much-changed ranks to put up more resistance than evidenced in the first-half horror show. There was Emmanuel Frimpong, the highly-rated Francis Coquelin and teenage prospect Serge Gnabry in midfield. There was Walcott, Chamakh and Arshavin in attack.
Such was the poverty of Arsenal’s early labours that Reading fans were taunting the visitors with crowing chants of “you’re getting thumped on the telly”, “are you Swindon in disguise?” and “Robin van Persie… is laughing at this”.
The Arsenal fans were enraged, chanting: “We want our Arsenal back”. The simple truth is that, for 40 minutes, Reading showed far more desire. Brian McDermott’s men were quicker to the ball, also swift to launch counter-attacks particularly down the flanks.
With Mikele Leigertwood controlling midfield and Jason Roberts and Noel Hunt moving intelligently in attack, Reading tore Arsenal apart early on, beginning in the 12th minute. Hunt released Hal Robson-Kanu and Jason Roberts made a feint to throw his markers off the scent. When Robson-Kanu’s cross came in, a yard of space free to volley beyond goalkeeper Damián Martínez. Five minutes later, Reading doubled their advantage, Koscielny turning Gunter’s cross into his own net. It got worse. Two minutes later, Mikele Leigertwood unleashed a shot and Martínez’s response was woeful, merely helping the ball into his own net. Eight minutes from the break, McCleary crossed for Hunt to head past Martínez.
Reading could have closed up shop, seeing out the first half but they remained open, a frailty that has cost them in the Premier League. Walcott punished slow reactions with a sprint through the centre before expertly lifting the ball past Adam Federici.
The goal inspired Arsenal. So did some words from Wenger at the break. Yet Reading should have had a penalty when Chamakh pulled down Hunt. Then Chamakh screamed for a penalty when Gunter handled. Kevin Friend booked Chamakh.
The Moroccan soon had more company in attack. Giroud arrived, making his mark with a firm, 64th-minute header. The Frenchman continued to threaten, seeing an effort pushed away by Martínez.
The clock seemed to be running against Arsenal. In the 89th minute, Koscielny headed in. The fourth official, Michael Oliver, signalled four minutes additional time but Friend — no Friend to Reading — kept the game going. Walcott fired in a shot that crossed the line before Shorey cleared. Jenkinson made sure.
When Friend blew for the end of 90 minutes, two of the Arsenal players thought it was all over, that there would be a replay. Giroud and Coquelin threw their shirts into the jubilant Arsenal fans before sheepishly having to request them back for extra time. The drama merely intensified. Chamakh made it 5-4 with a neat low strike before Pavel Pogrebnyak levelled. Penalties seemed inevitably until Walcott and then, unbelievably, Chamakh, made it 7-5 for the comeback kings.
