Iran raises earthquake death toll to 306
Iran has raised the death toll from Saturday's twin earthquakes to 306, a day after rescuers called off the search for survivors.
Health Minister Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi told a session of parliament on Monday that the number of dead had jumped by about 50 after victims expired in the hospital.
More than 3000 people were injured in the earthquakes, he said.
On Sunday the official death toll was given as 227, with about 1380 people injured.
Scores of aftershocks have shaken Iran's mountainous northeast since the 6.4 and 6.3 magnitude quakes hit the region, where some 300,000 people live near the borders with Azerbaijan and Armenia.
Iran is located on seismic fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 2003, about 26,000 people were killed by a 6.6 magnitude quake that flattened the historic southeastern city of Bam.
