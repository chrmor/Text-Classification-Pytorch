Sarah Palin, ¿blood libel¿, Arizona shooting, politics and the new lexicon of hate
What a week it has been for ­Sarah Palin, and what an education, too. She has learned that words have meaning.
And not just bumper-sticker meaning, either. Real meaning that goes ­beyond soundbites and ­slogans, placards and ­button-­pushing catchphrases such as Mama Grizzly and Hockey Mom or Don’t ­Retreat, Reload.
She has discovered that a term like ‘blood libel’, for instance, cannot just be thrown out flippantly into the ether without knowledge of its history. That blood libel is a slur which refers, specifically, to Jews feasting on the blood of Christians, and is therefore hugely offensive to the ­Jewish community.
To use it in a speech which concerned, in part, the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, the first Jewish congresswoman from ­Arizona, is therefore an act of such crassness that it should disqualify the speaker from serious public office for life.
Yet blood libel is not a phrase that occurs in everyday conversation. Most people would never have heard of it, until Palin and Glenn Reynolds, a conservative commentator writing in the Wall Street Journal, brought it into the public domain. Where it has been most commonly used this week is in far-Right commentary and websites; the fringes that Palin inhabits having had her shortcomings exposed too often in the mainstream media.
And that is where language is losing its meaning, where the lexicon of hate finds its fullest voice.
Did Palin conspire in the killing of six Americans and the attempted assassination of representative Giffords? No. Jared Lee Loughner, a mentally unwell, unemployed 22-year-old man, acted alone. Did Palin and the unthinking rhetoric of plenty like her contribute to the febrile atmosphere in which warped minds fester and ferment? Absolutely.
Immoderate language is commonplace in public debate these days. Not just extremes of abuse, but threats of violence and the complete disregard of boundaries or proportion.
The anonymity of the web has brought ugliness seeping from chatrooms and message boards via talk radio shock-jocks and on to the streets.
Barack Obama is Hitler, he’s a ­Muslim extremist, Armageddon is coming, it is the End of Days. These are all thought processes that began in the margins of debate and have somehow filtered into a wider public consciousness in America.
Britain does not possess the same demons, but give it time. There is extremism here, as was witnessed in the reaction to the death of murderer Raoul Moat, for instance, with Facebook groups forming to lionise his actions. 
That is modern social media for you. If there is one thing the human race is adept at, it is taking a good idea and corrupting it. So what began as a network for Harvard students metamorphosed into ‘all of you who want to kill coppers, join our club’.
On Twitter yesterday, David Potts, the leader of the Conservative group on South Tyneside city council, branded David Miliband ‘a w***er’ for taking a job with Sunderland Football Club. How insightful. How constructive.
Meanwhile, over in America, the Right are only too happy to ­appropriate violent imagery and metaphors to appeal to the gun-lovin’ rump in the middle.
And then, when a gun gets used for its primary purpose and observers join the dots across this landscape of extreme rhetoric, they ­pretend that there is no correlation between what people do and what people say.
Or do they? Palin seemed a little unsure when she broke her silence on Wednesday in an address that may have left the bereaved unsure as to the identity of the real victim.
Eschewing such outdated qualities as empathy, sympathy, human understanding or contrition, she quoted former President Ronald Reagan.
‘Acts of monstrous cruelty stand on their own,’ Palin insisted. ‘They begin and end with the individuals who commit them.’ How true.
Then it all went blurry. ‘Journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn,’ Palin continued.
So which is it? Do words have no effect (Palin’s first statement), or can they indeed incite violence if used injudiciously (her second).
Either Palin’s speechwriters are as dumb as she is — which cannot be ruled out, as they are presumably part-responsible for the blood libel debacle — or she is incapable of demonstrating intellect beyond just a random ­collection of patriotic homilies and gun images.
Palin has never understood the worth of words beyond superficial rabble-rousing and, faced with a ­genuine tragedy and three days to consider it, she gave a speech solely devoted to saving her own ­miserable skin.
Meanwhile, the erosion of ­language continues. The sole black Republican Party district chairman in ­Arizona, Anthony Miller, has resigned because of fears for his safety following constant verbal attacks and intimidation from the Right of his party.
At an event in Lake Havasu City, Miller said someone called out: ‘There’s Anthony, get a rope.’
‘I love the Republican Party, but I don’t want to take a bullet for anybody,’ he added.
And this time it wasn’t a metaphor, it was somebody’s life.
Without restraint, it ­usually is. 
• Police in the West Midlands have taken delivery of a £50,000 Lotus Evora — top speed 168mph — on a two-week trial basis.
‘It’s a very quick car and will prove a deterrent to speeding,’ said PC Angus Nairn.
Of course, an equal deterrent would be if Lotus stopped making cars with a top speed of 168mph. Just a thought.
