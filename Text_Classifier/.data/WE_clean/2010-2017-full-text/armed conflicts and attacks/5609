Kuwait, Jordan to give logistic help to Libya action: UK
LONDON: Arab nations Kuwait and Jordan will give “logistic contributions” to the international coalition action against the Libyan regime, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday.
The countries join Qatar, which has deployed Mirage fighter jets to become the only Arab state so far to commit military assets to the coalition led by the United States, Britain and France.
“We will be getting logistic contributions from countries like Kuwait and also Jordan. I hope further support will be forthcoming,” Cameron told lawmakers when asked about the level of Arab support.
He did not give any further details about the Kuwaiti and Jordanian contributions.
Cameron said there was “very strong” support in the Arab world for military action authorised by a UN Security Council resolution to prevent Moamer Kadhafi's forces killing Libyan civilians.
But he added that the speed with which Western nations launched air strikes to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and help rebel forces made it more difficult to get Arab nations on board.
“Because we had to act so quickly on Saturday it wasn't possible to bring forward as much Arab support as perhaps would have been welcomed. But the clear support is there,” Cameron said.
The announcement came as NATO allies sought to overcome splits over giving the organisation control of the no-fly zone and other operations.
NATO-member Turkey on Wednesday offered a submarine and warships to help enforce a UN arms embargo against Libya, the alliance said, but Ankara has expressed deep reservations about the Western strikes.
France has resisted giving NATO command of the international campaign, warning that running operations under the Western alliance's flag could alienate Arab nations that it wants to bring into the action.
The Arab League has backed the resolution but so far the Qatari warplanes are the only Arab contribution.
