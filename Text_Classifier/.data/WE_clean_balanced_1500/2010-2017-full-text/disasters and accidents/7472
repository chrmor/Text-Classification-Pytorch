Vietnam flood toll rises to 26
The death toll from floods that devastated central Vietnam over recent days has reached at least 26, disaster officials say.
A total of 19 deaths were reported in the two hardest-hit provinces of Quang Binh and Ha Tinh, according to provincial officials.
Seven other people were killed elsewhere in the central region, officials said.
In Ha Tinh alone, the heavy rains and rising waters have inundated at least 8400 hectares of crops while damaging nearly 27,000 houses, the provincial flood and storm control department said.
The province said it urgently needed "at least 60 tonnes of instant noodles, 8000 boxes of mineral water and 1000 kilograms of chemicals to clean water for domestic use."
Hundreds of military personnel have been mobilised to help evacuate residents threatened by the floodwaters.
