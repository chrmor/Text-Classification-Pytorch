After Joplin Tornado, a Search for the Missing
The Joplin tornado damaged nearly a third of the city. But workers were particularly concerned about a busy strip of big-box stores and densely populated apartment complexes that included Hampshire Terrace, where Becky Carithers returned Tuesday morning to the wreckage of her apartment. The site was now a bare slab of concrete and wood, and she found that the winds had stripped her of nearly all her possessions.
Ms. Carithers screamed in astonishment and joy when a man emerged from a car down the street. Her neighbor was alive. She cried aloud to him — “You lived!” — then repeated it more softly to her companion. Then she wept.
“I’m so glad he’s O.K.,” she said. She fell into her companion’s arms, her chest heaving against him.
“Oh, my God,” she said.
The sobs deepened and continued for a long time before she spoke again, her voice heavy with revelation: “We lived. We lived.”
Most of the Hampshire Terrace buildings had already been searched once and marked by a spray-painted “.” But they were now being searched more thoroughly. A crew of 50 firefighters from planned to spend the day sifting through the wreckage in the rubble of the two-story buildings in the horseshoe-shaped complex.
The cadaver-sniffing dogs they requested had not arrived, and high-tech cameras and listening devices could do only so much, so the work was slow and back-breaking as they moved boards and bricks one at a time.
“This is one of the last areas where they don’t have a firm, clear picture of what happened,” said Ed Beirne, an assistant fire chief in charge of the group.
He took pains to manage expectations. “We’re always hopeful, but we briefed the guys to plan for the worst,” he said. “Anyone who was injured in here is probably expired by now.”
The residents of the 100-unit complex used the break in the weather after days of continued rain, hail, lightning and tornado warnings to search for salvageable possessions — a child’s favorite toy, a lost wedding ring, the flag that had been draped over a father’s coffin. Some wondered where they would put these waterlogged keepsakes, pointing out that they needed to find a place to live.
The biggest discoveries were of each other. Neighbors shared tearful embraces and recounted harrowing episodes of riding out the storm.
One elderly woman climbed into her wheelchair when she heard the warning and was pinned under debris until she was rescued by her daughter. A couple hid with their son and grandchild under the staircase. A few doors down, a family fled the complex as soon as they heard the sirens, worried that the building would not withstand the hit.
They wondered about neighbors they had not yet seen or heard from.
“I keep hearing the count go up, and I keep praying it stops,” said Jessica Blackwood, 22, who lived in an apartment with her 2-year-old son and whose grandmother lived in another apartment. Both were away when the tornado struck. “I’m so scared one of these times I’m going to hear a name I know.”
, on a visit to , said that he was monitoring the federal response to the tornado and that he planned to visit on Sunday “to talk with folks who’ve been affected, to talk to local officials about our response effort and hopefully to pray with folks and give them whatever assurance and comfort I can that the entire country is going to be behind them.”
Leaders of the recovery effort here, who have established a perimeter restricting access to the affected area as well as the makeshift morgues, declined to discuss the list of people who remain unaccounted for. Some emphasized that they expected their ranks to include many people who fled the tornado or who have now sought shelter elsewhere.
As the days have passed, those still searching for loved ones adopted a more desperate tone.
“Ok people I’m looking for a JEFF MASSEY,” Lacy Letts wrote on a Facebook page set up by The Joplin Globe. “If anyone knows anything, please let me know asap. We were just told he was dead.”
Another sought information about Will Norton, who was returning from his high school graduation on Sunday with his father when he was sucked through the sunroof of his SUV.
His family said they had heard reports that he was taken to a hospital, but no hospital in the area seems to have a record that he was there. “The family is looking for anyone who has actually SEEN Will,” another Facebook page says. “All prayers are greatly appreciated.”
