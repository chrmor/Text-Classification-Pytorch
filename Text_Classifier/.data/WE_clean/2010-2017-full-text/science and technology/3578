GSAT-5P launch fails, satellite vehicle explodes mid-air
SRIHARIKOTA: ISROâ€™s space programme suffered a major setback on Saturday as the launch of advanced communication satellite GSAT-5P failed due to major technical fault in the first phase. The rocket geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) exploded mid-air moments after it took off from the Sriharikota rocket launch centre. The satellite GSAT-5P was expected to serve the needs of the telecommunication sector and the weather department and would have eventually replaced the INSAT-2E satellite that was sent up in 1999. It weighed 2,130 kg and the cost of its production was around Rs 125 crore. The GSAT-5P satellite had a life span of over 13 years and had 36 transponders - automatic receivers and transmitters for communication and broadcast of signals.
