Coal mine collapse in Pakistan kills 8, another 4 missing
A Pakistani official says heavy rain has caused the collapse of a coal mine in the country's northwest, killing at least eight miners and leaving another four missing and feared dead.
Local administration official Dost Mohammad said Sunday that the mine in the Orakzai tribal region collapsed the previous evening. He says military rescuers succeeded in saving 29 miners despite being hampered by the continuing rain.
Another official, Latifur Rehman, says heavy rains in other parts of the northwest have led to the deaths of seven people in two days due to collapsing roofs and walls.
