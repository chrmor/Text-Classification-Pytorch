76 Rescued, Five Missing After Bali Ferry Capsizes
Banyuwangi, East Java. Five people, including an 18-month-old baby are still missing while 76 others have been rescued after a ferryboat sank in the Bali strait on Friday at around noon, an official said on Saturday.
Vessels, inflatable boats and three teams of divers from the Banyuwangi Water Police, the Navy and the National Search and Rescue Agency have been deployed since Saturday morning.
"The search is also conducted with helicopters because sinking victims are usually found floating," said Didi Hamzar of the Denpasar Search and Rescue Office.
Data from the office shows five passengers are still missing, including the ship helmsman, boat crew members, a woman and her 18-month-old baby and another passenger identified Agus Mangtia. "The number of passengers who survived is 76," Didi added. They are currently being treated at a number of nearby hospitals. The KMP Rafelia II, which was sailing to Ketapang Port in East Java's Banyuwangi district from Gilimanuk Port in Bali's Jembrana district, capsized at around 1 p.m. local time after its bilge compartment reportedly sprung a leak. The ferryboat sank about 500 meters from Ketapang Port. At least 29 vehicles, mostly trucks and minibuses, went down with the vessel.Show More
