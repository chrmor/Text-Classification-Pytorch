Teacher Rafe Esquith files $1B suit vs. L.A. schools
Los Angeles (CNN)The nation's second largest school district has been hit with a $1 billion class-action lawsuit alleging it conducts "witch hunts" against older teachers in a "shrewd" effort to save money on retirement benefits.
The suit was filed Thursday on behalf of about 2,000 teachers by Rafe Esquith, 61, one of the Los Angeles Unified School District's best-known and most popular teachers.
It comes on the heels of reports that the L.A. school board voted unanimously and behind closed doors to fire Esquith for misconduct. Earlier this year, Esquith was pulled from his classroom and placed under investigation.
Esquith's case gained the support of actors Hal Holbrook and Sir Ian McKellan, longtime fans of the teacher's efforts to bring classic works by Mark Twain and William Shakespeare to low-income immigrant students.
Thursday's lawsuit "is the largest class action by teachers in the history of public education," said attorney Ben Meiselas, who represents Esquith, the lead plaintiff, along with attorney and CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos.
District officials could not say how many teachers had been sent to "teacher jail" over the past five years. But the district's attorney, David Holmquist, recently said about 170 of the district's 31,748 teachers are currently under suspension for suspected misconduct. If the past is any indicator, fewer than half of them will return to the classroom, he added.
He asked school officials why they didn't want to know who liked him, pointing out that his classroom is a magnet for teachers from around the world. "That's not our job," he said he was told. "Our job is to find the people who don't like you."
