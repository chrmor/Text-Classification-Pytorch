The National Coalition Party wins the Finnish parliamentary election (44 seats), with the True Finns, third-place finishers, emerging as a new major political party (39 seats). Biggest losers are the Centre Party (36 seats); coalition talks will probably be held between the Coalition, the True Finns and the Social Democrats (42 seats).(YLE)British Prime Minister David Cameron is criticised by the University of Oxford for an "incorrect and highly misleading" claim that only one black student was enrolled there in 2009. During a question and answer session on the effect of higher tuition fees on poorer students, Cameron had called the figures "disgraceful". The University says that at least 26 black students started there that year. (BBC)
