Leicester City confirmed as 2015/16 Premier League champions
Leicester City have completed one of the most remarkable triumphs in sporting history by winning the 2015/16 Premier League title.
The club's first top-flight championship in their 132-year history was sealed following Tottenham's 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Monday night, meaning they have an unassailable seven-point lead at the top of the table with two games left to play.
Claudio Ranieri's side missed the chance to claim the trophy on Sunday afternoon when they could only draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford - but they needed to wait just over 24 hours for their title glory to be sealed.
At the start of the season, Leicester were 5000/1 outsiders to become champions after flirting with relegation for most of last season and they were playing in League One as recently as 2009.
But the appointment of Ranieri as manager last summer heralded an incredible title charge with star players Riyad Mahrezand Jamie Vardy being named Player of the Year by the PFA and the FWA respectively.
Leicester will receive the trophy following their final home game of the season against Everton, live on Sky Sports, on Saturday evening and are set to receive a Guard of Honour from last season's champions Chelsea when they visit Stamford Bridge on the final day.
Many of Leicester's players watched their moment of triumph at Jamie Vardy's house and their wild scenes of celebration were shown on Monday Night Football shortly after the final whistle.
Captain Wes Morgan was among them and has spoken of his pride at the achievement.
"It's the best feeling of my career and I couldn't be prouder that it's as part of this team," he said.
"Everyone's worked so hard for this, nobody believed we could do it, but here we are, Premier League champions and deservedly so.
"I've never known a spirit like the one between these boys, we're like brothers. People saw it last season when everyone expected us to be relegated, but we fought back to prove people wrong. This season's been a continuation of that. We've built on the momentum, but I don't think anyone believed it would come to this."
He added of receiving the trophy against Everton at the weekend: "Saturday can't come quickly enough. I can't wait to get my hands on the trophy."
Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher was full of praise for their achievements - and that of their manager.
He said: "It has to be a statue for Ranieri in the morning.Â Let's not forget the reaction when he got the job. He was laughed out of town let's be honest.
"Finally now he may get the credit he deserves . He will get the recognition because he has achieved something no other manager might.
"He will now never ever be forgotten and this story will be told in a hundred years' time because this is so rare. Those players are now legends for a lifetime."
