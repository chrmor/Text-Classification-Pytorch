EU eyes spending 700 million euros for refugee crisis
The European Union's head office wants to swiftly push through a proposal to earmark 700 million euros ($760 million) in humanitarian aid to deal with the refugee crisis.
EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Christos Stylianides said Wednesday that 300 million euros ($325 million) would be earmarked for this year and be used "where it is most needed," alluding to Greece and the nations along the Balkan trail that refugees use to move into the heartland of the 28-nation bloc. The overall total would cover three years.
Stylianides said the funds would not be diverted from aid programs aimed at non-EU nations.
His proposal will still need to be approved by the European parliament and the member states. EU leaders meet Monday for a summit focusing on the migration issue. [AP]
