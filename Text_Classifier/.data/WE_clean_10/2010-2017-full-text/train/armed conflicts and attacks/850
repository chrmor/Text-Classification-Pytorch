13 dead after suspected Boko Haram gunmen attack college in north Nigeria's Kano
Kano, Nigeria: Gunmen and suicide bombers stormed a government college in northern Nigeria's main city of Kano on Wednesday, firing repeatedly on fleeing students and setting off an explosion, the military said.
At least 13 people have been killed and 34 others wounded when police fought a battle with suspected Boko Haram jihadists in Kano, northern Nigeria, the state's police chief says.
Kano State police commissioner Adelere Shinaba said the gunmen, whom he described as "insurgents", ran onto the grounds of the Kano Federal College of Education after exchanging fire with police outside.
"They were obviously suicide bombers. One of our officers shot at one of the gunmen and the explosives on him went off, killing him on the spot," he said on Wednesday.
