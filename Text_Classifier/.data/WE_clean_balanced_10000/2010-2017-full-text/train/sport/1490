Kendra Harrison breaks 100m hurdles world record at London Anniversary Games... But will not be at 2016 Rio Olympics
Kendra Harrison got over the disappointment of missing out on the USA team for the 2016 Rio Olympics by breaking Yordanka Donkova's 28-year-old 100m hurdles world record.
The 23-year-old American dipped under the Bulgarian's time of 12.21, set at Stara Zagora in 1988, clocking 12.20 seconds at the London Anniversary Games.
She collapsed into floods of tears after realising her achievement at the Olympic Stadium. 
On a night where Usain Bolt ran his first 200m of the season, Harrison stole centre stage as she issued the perfect riposte to not being selected for their Rio team.
After posing by the clock with her new world best time, Harrison said: 'I wanted to come out here with a vengeance to show these even though I won't be going to the Olympics I had to give it all I had.
'That 12.40 (in the heats earlier on Friday) got my confidence back. I knew I had it in me, I ran as hard as I could today,' 
Harrison, who set a United States record of 12.24 in May, added: 'To hear people call me a world record holder, it sounds remarkable.
'Initially I saw 12.5 and I was just happy to come out here and win. I was so happy when it came up and I was feeling really blessed. 
'It shows that even if you don't go out there and make the team, you have to keep going and be strong. I just ran my best and look what happened.' 
Harrison had just destroyed a top-quality field, including British heptathlon star Jessica Ennis-Hill, to show why she should be at this summer's games in Rio.
At the US trials Brianna Rollins won the 100m hurdles final in 12.34 seconds, the second-fastest time in 2016, as American record holder Harrison could only finish sixth to miss out on selection. Kristi Castlin and Nia Ali will join Rollins in Rio.
