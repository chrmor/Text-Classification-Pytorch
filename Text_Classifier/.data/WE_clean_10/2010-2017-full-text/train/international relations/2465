Iran Signs Cooperation Agreements With Italian Prime Minister
Iran and Italy have signed a series of bilateral agreements during a visit by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to Tehran.
Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, reported on April 12 that the agreements include plans for cooperation between the Italian electricity and gas company Enel and the National Iranian Gas Export Company.
Enel said the memorandum of understanding lays out details for possible cooperation involving natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and related infrastructure.
The firm said in a statement that the agreement could include information-sharing, studies, and analysis and training -- "as well as exploring future opportunities for long term supplies."
Iran’s Deputy Energy Minister Ali Reza Daemi said the two countries also agreed to build several biomass, solar, and geothermal power plants.
IRNA reports that other deals include a car component agreement with Danieli Group, an agreement with the Milan Airports company to renovate Tehran’s domestic airport, and deal focused on promoting tourism in Iran.
