Ruhul Amin and Reyaad Khan: the footballer and the boy who wanted to be first Asian PM
Community leaders and politicians call for answers over deaths of British Isis militants who were killed in drone strikes authorised by UK government
Reyaad Khan, an Islamic State militant from Wales who once aspired to be the UK’s first Asian prime minister has instead become the first Briton to be killed by the RAF outside a British warzone.
In a statement to parliament, David Cameron confirmed that Khan died in the targeted drone strike near Raqqa, Syria on 21 August. Travelling in the same car as Khan was another Briton, Ruhul Amin, 26, who was also killed.
Both Khan and Amin had appeared in an Isis recruitment video in June 2014 alongside Cardiff-born Nasser Muthana, arguing the case for Isis. In the video, titled There Is No Life Without Jihad, Amin called on his fellow western Muslims to join Isis in Syria. “Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car, the family you have?,” he said. “If you do Allah will give you back 700 times more.”
Sitting cross-legged on the ground, one person removed from Amin, was Khan who said: “You can be here in these golden times, fighting, or you can be on the sidelines commentating. It’s your choice.”
Within weeks of the video emerging, both Khan and Amin had their assets frozen by the Treasury, along with Muthana and Muthana’s younger brother. This freezing order was later renewed in July 2015, according to Treasury documents.
Khan, a 21-year-old straight-A student from Riverside in Cardiff, was once a politically active teenager. In 2009, he was said to be “excited” to meet former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, and in a Facebook post said he wanted to become the country’s first Asian prime minister.
In 2010 he was filmed speaking of his desire to rid the world of evil and of the problems of growing up in a deprived inner-city area. In the interview, which was obtained by the Guardian, he argued the government wasted resources on “illegal wars” and said more money ought to be spent on young people to help prevent them being led down the “wrong path”.
Asked if the world was a good place, Khan replied: “The world can be a lovely place but you’ve just got to get rid of the evil. If everyone could choose the good, the evil will go away.”
By November 2013 he had travelled to Syria, taking the nom de guerre Abu Dujana. He began using his social media accounts to post graphic and satirically dark messages. On Twitter he boasted of the murders he had committed, writing “executed many prisoners yesterday”.
In another he wrote: “Anyone want to sponsor my explosive belt? Gucci, give me a shout.” A further post showed bloody corpses, which Khan said belonged to a group that he and other militants had captured and executed.
On Monday, friends of Khan and his family in Cardiff reacted with horror to the circumstances of his death. Mohammed Islam, a family friend and community leader, said: “This is very shocking. It’s so sad for the family and devastating for the whole community. We never expected it to come to this.”
Islam said Khan’s family was respectable and law-abiding. “They should not be blamed for their son’s actions. It is nothing to do with them.” He said the family wanted time to grieve, adding: “I think the whole community will want answers.”
There was no answer at the door of the terraced house where Khan used to live, a 10-minute walk from the centre of the Welsh capital. Not far from Khan’s former home, sadness was expressed at the Jalalia mosque, where members of his family are believed to worship.
Mosque secretary Mokaddus Miah said: “If a person has done something bad then he has what’s coming to him. Anyone who wants to do something wrong must be punished. But I would have preferred to see him tried in a British court.”
Khan’s death also provoked questions amongst Welsh politicians. The leader of Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, said: “There is a real danger now that the refugee crisis will be exploited as an excuse for launching a bombing campaign in Syria.
“Plaid Cymru has also been disturbed by the news that the UK government authorised the killing of a British citizen among possibly others on Syrian soil, despite parliament voting down any military action in the region.”
Khan’s fellow armed militant, Amin, was born in Moulvibazar, north-east Bangladesh in February 1989. He was raised and went to school in Aberdeen and was described in local reports as a keen footballer who frequented nightclubs and liked drinking.
Weeks after appearing in the Isis recruitment video Amin gave an interview to ITV in which he described the moment his plane took off from Gatwick Airport as “one of the happiest of my life”.
He said: “I did not learn my jihad from the Aberdeen mosque, I learned that through my own on the internet or whatever.” Within weeks of that interview he was reported to have been killed by an Iraqi army Swat team in Ramadi, 75 miles west of Baghdad.
The reports turned out to be incorrect: he later contacted his sister by social media channels, reportedly telling her: “I do miss you, I love you, but I love Allah more.”
The cousin of Ruhul Amin said he was “shocked” to learn that he had been killed. Sueb Miah had previously pleaded with the man he described as being “like his brother” to come home from Iraq.
Miah said: “It’s a real shock. I guess it means I finally know what happened to him but I can’t say I’m glad to find out. I can’t talk on behalf of the community but as far as I was concerned when I was growing up with him he was a good boy. When he was younger he did his prayers, he had lots of friends, he mixed with everybody.
“He would always stick up for the weaker person. He had a big heart. I don’t know what happened to him.”
And a family friend also revealed that he thought Amin wanted to come back to Britain - but did not want to face the consequences.
Maqbool Chaudry, 46, owner of the Khyber Pass takeaway near the Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre, knew Amin since he was a young boy. Chaudry described him as a normal youngster, who would look up to him and call him uncle when growing up in Aberdeen.
Chaudry said: “If he had any problems he would come and speak to me. What I saw in the last few months that I knew him was that he started to go quiet. I just thought he had one or two family issues and it was because of that. The next thing I knew he had moved away. Then I was watching the telly one day and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.
“Personally I felt guilty for a while. I felt that if I could have seen it coming I could have done something. But we never had any indication. I just treated him like one of my own kids.
He added: “I spoke to him after he left, but not directly, and he said that he didn’t think he would come back again. He said he was a dead man anyway. He was in a no-win situation. I would say he wanted to come back but he was looking at a long sentence. So he decided to stay out there.”
Speaking to ITV on Monday a childhood friend, Steven Marvin, told the channel he believed Amin had been radicalised in Birmingham. “He said he met people in Birmingham and he was spoken to there and offered to go to Syria under the promise he was allowed to leave whenever he wanted to.”
Marvin said that he had spoken to Amin from Syria and had heard gunshots in the background. He said: “I asked him, aren’t you scared of getting shot? He said, if he dies, he’ll be with Allah. That kind of shocked me. You’re not used to hearing, especially in Aberdeen, you’re not used to hearing your friends talk like that. He had no fear whatsoever of death.”
