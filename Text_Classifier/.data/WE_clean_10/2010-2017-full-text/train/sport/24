Nigeria's Abugan stripped of two silver medals
Nigeria's Folashade Abugan has been stripped of her 400metres silver medal after failing a drug test at the Commonwealth Games.
Abugan thus becomes the third Nigerian to fail a drugs test after 110m hurdler Samuel Okon and Damola Osayemi, who claimed gold in the women's 100m.
Abugan's A sample showed traces of testosterone prohormone, which is prohibited under the current World Anti-Doping Agency list and she subsequently waived the right to have her B sample analysed.
Abugan's silver medal in women's 400 metres will now be awarded to Aliann Tabitha Pompey of Guyana.
Besides this, Nigeria's silver medal in women's 4x400 metre relay, of which Abugan was a part, now be awarded to England, the Commonwealth Games Federation informed on Friday.
