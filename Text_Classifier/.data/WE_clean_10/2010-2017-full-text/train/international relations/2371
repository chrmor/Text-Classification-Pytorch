Turkish document cites Israel as major threat
The Turkish national security council recently designated Israel  as a "major threat" in a document known as the "red book," which lists threats to Turkey, local media reported.
The council decided to remove Syria, Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia from the list of threats. Greece, however, is still considered a threat, whereas Iran was also removed from the list.
This is the first time Turkey has designated Israeli activity in the Middle East as a threat.
The document, which will remain in effect for the next five years, noted that Israeli actions may cause various states in the region to embark on an arms race. The document further stated that the Middle East must be free of nuclear weapons.
Apart from Israel, Turkey added other threats to its list, including online terror and global warming.
Relations between Jerusalem and Ankara deteriorated significantly since the raid on Gaza-bound flotilla last May which killed nine people. Turkey has insisted that Israel apologize, a demand dismissed  by the Jewish state.
Last week Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would not participate in an Athens climate conference if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends. He also noted that Israel is close to losing Turkey "as a good friend in the Middle East."
