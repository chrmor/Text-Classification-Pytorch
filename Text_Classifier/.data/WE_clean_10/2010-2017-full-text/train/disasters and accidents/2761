LUCKNOW: The fury of a thunderstorm cooled the parched Gangetic Plains but left 41 dead and over three dozen injured in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday. The toll in last three days has crossed 80 mark with the latest fatalities. Rail and road traffic as well as power supply was also badly hit in large parts of eastern UP and the rain caused extensive damage to mango and wheat crop. The storm packing winds of up to 70 kmph left 16 dead in Shahjahanpur with people killed by uprooted trees falling on them or walls collapsing. At least 11 deaths were reported from Lakhimpur Kheri, nine from Badayun, three from Ghaziabad and two from Bareilly. Six people suffered severe burn injuries after being struck by lightening in Ambedkarnagar. The state government announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each for the families of the victims. While uprooted trees blocked roads at many places air traffic at Amausi airport was hit in the morning. A Go-Air flight from New Delhi with nearly 30 passengers on board made desperate attempts to land at Amausi airport defying gusty winds and a raging duststorm but had to abort its attempt and return to Delhi. The storm also damaged power transmission towers carrying 132KV and 220KV lines in Badaun, Hardoi, Sitapur, Lakhimpur leaving the area in darkness. The state meteorological director JP Gupta said upper air cyclonic circulation caused by pressure variation over the Bay of Bengal was responsible for the storm. Similar conditions would continue on Sunday, he said.
