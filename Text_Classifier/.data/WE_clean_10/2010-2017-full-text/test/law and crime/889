Vietnamese dissident sentenced to 8 years in jail
A lawyer says a Vietnamese court has sentenced a former Communist Party official to eight years in jail for posting articles on the Internet calling for a multiparty system and democracy. Defense lawyer Tran Lam says Vi Duc Hoi was convicted on Wednesday of spreading anti-government propaganda. He was also sentenced to five years of house arrest after serving his jail sentence. The lawyer says Hoi was accused of using the Internet to promote a multiparty system and democracy. Hoi joined the Communist Party in 1980 and quickly rose to a high-ranking position that involved overseeing the education of upcoming local party leaders. But he started calling for democratic reforms in 2006 and was expelled from the party a year later.
