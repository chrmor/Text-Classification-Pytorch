Poland's new government rejects migrant quotas after Paris attacks â€” RT World News
Poland's future minister for European affairs said his government will not accept EU-mandate quotas for refugees following the terrorist attacks in France.
Konrad Szymanski, who will take the office on Monday as part of the country's new conservative government, said his cabinet didn't agree with their predecessors' commitment to take a share in the refugee burden.
Now, "in the face of the tragic acts in Paris, we do not see the political possibilities to implement" the plan, he told the right-leaning news portal wPolityce.pl.

Poland joins a quartet of EU members that have defied Brussels' plan to redistribute the inflow of asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa among members of the union. Security concerns are high among the reasons touted by Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which don't want to accept predominantly Muslim refugees on their soil.
The string of terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday night killed at least 128 people. The French government considers the terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) as the culprit behind the tragedy. In fact, IS claimed responsibility for the attacks, threatening more to come.
