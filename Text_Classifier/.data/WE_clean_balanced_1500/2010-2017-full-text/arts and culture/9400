Ugandan court releases British producer of gay play
David Cecil released on bail after being accused of disobeying media council orders by staging play about gay businessman
A Ugandan court has released on bail a British theatre producer who was arrested for staging a play about a gay businessman.
His lawyer, Francis Onyango, said on Mondaythat David Cecil, who spent the weekend in a prison near the Ugandan capital, Kampala, had been granted bailÂ by a magistrate who kept his passport.
Officials accuse Cecil of disobeying the orders of the Uganda media council by staging performances of The River and the Mountain in theatres in the Ugandan capital last month.
The play's main character is a young Ugandan businessman who loses his friends and then is murdered after revealing he is gay.
Homosexuals are highly stigmatised in Uganda. In 2009 a politician from the ruling National Resistance Movement party introduced a bill proposing the death penalty for what he called "aggravated homosexuality". The bill, which is now in committee, has been condemned by some world leaders.
The bill's author, David Bahati, says he still believes it will be passed one day.
Cecil will return to court on 18 October, according to Onyango. He faces two years in jail if convicted.
