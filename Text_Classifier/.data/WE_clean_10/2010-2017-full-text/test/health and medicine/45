Americas Region Declared Free of Endemic Measles
Global health authorities on Tuesday declared the Americas free of endemic measles, the first region to be so certified.
The hemisphere’s last case of endemic measles — meaning one that did not spring from an imported strain — was in 2002.
Normally, it takes three years without cases to declare a disease eradicated from a region, but in this instance it took 14 years.
Experts at the Pan American Health Organization in Washington, D.C., where the announcement was made, cited several reasons for the delay: poor communication between local and national health departments in some countries, large numbers of unvaccinated mobile migrants in others, and parts of other countries that were unreachable because of fighting.
