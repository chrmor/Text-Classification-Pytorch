Leader Says He Did Not Endorse Raid in Philippines
MANILA — President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines tried to distance himself Wednesday from a botched counterterrorism raid that left 44 elite police officers dead on Sunday and jeopardized a landmark peace deal with rebels in the country’s south.
During a nationally televised speech, Mr. Aquino said he did not specifically authorize about 400 police officers from an elite commando unit to conduct the raid early Sunday in a remote part of the island of Mindanao to capture a top terrorism suspect.
“ ‘Can we proceed with the mission?’ ” I don’t think I was ever asked that question,” Mr. Aquino said, without specifying who had ordered the operation that killed the suspect, Zulkifli bin Hir, a senior leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist network.
The raid was conducted near areas controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, with whom the government signed a cease-fire agreement last year. The rebel group’s chairman, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, said Wednesday that his group had not been informed of the operation ahead of time, as is required under the deal with the government, and that his fighters were acting in self-defense when they fired on the police.
