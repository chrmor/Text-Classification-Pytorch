Rush to hold weddings on special 10/10/10 date
Sunday will be one of the busiest days of the year's wedding calendar with couples hoping the date 10/10/10 will bring them luck.
Some register offices are opening on a Sunday for the first time after couples asked if they could marry on the date.
Manchester Register Office is opening for only the third time on a Sunday since it was established in 1837.
Ngaryan Li, who is marrying Steven Higham, said: "I'm of Chinese origin and it's seen as a very good date."
She added: "It means the perfect day."
Ms Li, whose parents came to the UK from Hong Kong some 35 years ago, said: "I was ringing round quite a lot of places, then Manchester Register Office said they were going to be open.
"It wasn't my first choice - of somewhere local - but the main thing was offering the date."
In total, six couples have arranged to get married at Manchester Register Office on Sunday.
Ms Li, a solicitor at Stephensons in St Helens, Merseyside, met her fiance when she took over his job and they spent a handover period together. He now works as a legal executive in the firm's Wigan branch.
They have been planning their wedding for about a year.
Ms Li said: "I feel very lucky to get that date."
Chichester Register Office, in West Sussex, is opening for the first Sunday in its history.
A spokesman for West Sussex County Council said it was "in response to popular demand".
