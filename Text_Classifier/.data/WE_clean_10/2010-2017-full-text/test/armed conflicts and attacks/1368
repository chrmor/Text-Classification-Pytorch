A protest is planned at the Egyptian embassy in Washington after violent clashes between the Egyptian government and people.
Protest's organizer Mohammad Abdeljaber says more than 500 people have signed up on Facebook to be at Saturday's protest. Abdeljaber, a student at Georgetown who is getting a PhD in Arabic and Islamic studies, says he wants Egyptians to know that Americans are watching and aware of what's going on in the country.
Protesters in Egypt have taken to the streets of the Egyptian capital, battling police with stones, bottles and firebombs and burning down the ruling party headquarters.
