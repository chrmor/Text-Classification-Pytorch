Don Rickles recovering from flesh-eating disease
Don Rickles is on the mend. After canceling several shows due to treatment for a leg infection, the New York Post has reported that the 87-year-old comedy legend was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, better known as a flesh-eating disease. Rickles underwent three surgical debridements — a removal of the infected tissue — and a skin graft, which forced him to stay off his feet for a while. Fortunately, his rep tells us the condition was discovered quickly, Rickles was treated successfully and he’s well on the road to recovery. “He has been rehabbing the leg, is back on his feet and is doing wonderfully,” the rep said. “He is looking forward to be back on the road after the first of the year.”
