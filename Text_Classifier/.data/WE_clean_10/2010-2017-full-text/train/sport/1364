Tipperary family claim €10.6m lotto win
A Tipperary family have come forward as the winners of €10.6 million from this week's lottery.
The family, who wish to remain anonymous, matched the first six numbers drawn in Wednesday’s Lotto to win a total of €10,613,747. The family syndicate scooped the prize after they purchased a €6 Quick Pick ticket in Scanlon's Newsagents on Liberty Square in Thurles.
One member of the family said they cannot believe they won.
"We can’t believe our luck. We’ve been playing Lotto for years and always hoped we’d hit the jackpot one day.”
The jackpot has been rolling since Wednesday 19 December 2012.
Before the family came forward, it was rumoured Tipperary hurler Lar Corbett scooped the top prize. Mr Corbett took to Twitter to end the rumour, tweeting: “I would like to put a stop to all the story's about the €10,6 million it is not TRUE.”
Owner of Scanlon's Newsagents Vincent Scanlon spoke on RTÉ’s News at One, where he said he has no idea who bought the winning ticket. “There were two of us working that day…so it could be either one of us who sold the ticket,” he said. Mr Scanlon said that a syndicate previously won €200,000 each from the lottery at his shop, but said this winner remains silent. “This guy or lady is probably sitting scared somewhere. I would be, I know,” he said. “I just hope they get very good advice on their win. Whether they come forward or not is a very personal thing. Some people can handle that publicity, others would find it so life-changing that they might not be able to cope with it.”
The winning numbers were 3, 8, 11, 23, 27 and 33. The bonus number was 36.
