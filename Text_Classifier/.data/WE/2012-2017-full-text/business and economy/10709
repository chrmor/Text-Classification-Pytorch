ACCC sues US video games giant Valve
The Australian consumer watchdog is suing the US company behind the wildly popular online video games distribution platform Steam, alleging it misled Australian consumers about their rights and refused to give refunds.
In court documents filed on Thursday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleges that Valve, the maker of Steam, which has over 65 million users worldwide, made false or misleading representations to Australian customers.
Among many allegations, the consumer watchdog said that Valve claimed that Australian consumers were not entitled to a refund for any games sold via Steam under any circumstances. The watchdog also alleges that Valve excluded, restricted or modified statutory guarantees and warranties that goods would be of acceptable quality.
Three Australians are mentioned in court documents who experienced issues with Valve.
On its website Valve states that, unless required by local law, it does "not offer refunds or exchanges" on games.
