10:18: Roger Goodell just said Green Bay is the "smallest city in the country." I think he meant smallest city in the NFL.
10:06: Final snap . . . and we're done. The Lombardi Trophy is going back to Green Bay, and Aaron Rodgers is the obvious MVP: 24-for-39 for 304 yards.
10:06: Just :46 left. GB will run it out. The Gatorade already has been dumped on Mike McCarthy.
10:05: Game over. High pass to Mike Wallace, and he can't hang on. No flag, and the replay backs up the officials.
10:04: On third and 5, Ben overthrows Wallace. Match point?
10:02: On first down from his 13 Roethlisberger hits Heath Miller for 15 yards . . . Then Hines Ward gets Pitt another 4.
9:59: Flag on the kickoff. Personal foul Keyaron Fox shoves Pitt deep in its territory. We're at the 2-minute warning.
9:56: Incomplete to Nelson on third down. Anthony Madison defends, and GB kicks the short FG. Green Bay up 31-25, with just 2:07 left. Remember, Pitt has nly one timeout left. Rogers has 304 passing yards, BTW.
9:55: Second-and-goal at the 7 . . . quick out to James Jones gets GB to the 5.
9:53: James Jones has GB 1st-and-goal at the 8 with a nice sideline catch. We're under 4 minutes.
9:52: Starks run understandably catches Pitt off guard. It's only the 10th Packer run. GB 1st-and-10 at the Pitt 30.
9:51: Rodgers-to-Jennings over the middle for 31 yards. Huge play. GB into Pitt territory.
9:49: Nelson gets nine yards back. We have about 6:30 left in the game.
9:48: Green Bay starts at its 25, and Ziggy Hood nails Rodgers for a sack and a 4-yard loss.
9:45: That's 53 total points in the game, so anyone who bet the over can now start counting their cash.
9:44: Pitchout to Randle El works and Pittsburgh scores the two-point conversion. It's a 3-point game, with Green Bay up 28-25.
9:43: Touchdown Pittsburgh. Laser down the left side that Mike Wallace hauls in over his shoulder. Back to a one-possession game. Pitt will go for two.
9:42: Wide-open Hines Ward gets Pitt down to the GB 25, and facing third-and-reasonable.
9:40: Holding call on Pitt leaves them facing first-and-20 and the GB 42.
9:37: Steelers start at their 34 . . . 9-yard gain on first down.
9:35: Aaron Rodgers is now 19-for-33 for 240 yards with zero picks and three TDs. Jordy Nelson has 131 yards on 8 catches, and if not for all of his drops he might be threatening the 200-yard mark.
9:33: Good stat from Fox: Mendenhall had only 2 fumbles in 347 touches during the regular season. Commercial time.
9:32: Packers have converted all three of Pittsburgh's turnovers into touchdowns. But there's still 11:57 left, so don't go anywhere.
9:31: Touchdown Green Bay to make it a two-possession game again. Greg Jennings in the right corner of the end zone. PAT is good, and Pack is up 28-17. That's Jennings' second TD.
9:30: Busted play, Rodgers goes down for a loss of six. 2nd-and-goal from the 8.
9:29: Redemption for Nelson. GB picks up the all-out blitz, and gets good yardage after the catch. First and goal at the 2.
9:28: Jordy Nelson drops the pass on 2nd-and-10. That's three drops for him. Rodgers now 17-for-31 for 194 yards as GB faces 3rd and 10.
9:27: Packers convert. Nice diving catch of a low ball by james Jones for 12 yards, to inside the Pitt 40.
9:26: GB facing 3rd and 7 at its 48. Packers got touchdowns off the two previous Pitt turnovers.
9:25: Turnover. Mendenhall fumbles and Desmond Bishop recovers for Green Bay. That's Pitt's third turnover. The Steelers were late to realize the ball had popped loose.
9:21: Mendenhall gains 8 to the GB 33, and that's the end of the third quarter. Packers still up by 21-17
9:20: Good move by Pitt on the GB. Steelers improve their field possession by 13 yards and will start at the GB 40.
9:18: Antonio Brown gets the punt return to the Pitt 42, but Packers had an illegal man downfield . . . Re-punt coming, which negates a very good punt by Packers.
9:17: Green Bay's challenge is rejected, and the Pack is charged with its first timeout. Only :30 left in the third quarter, BTW. Here comes the GB punt.
9:15: Pretty important challenge. I don't think it will get overruled, and if it doesn't GB of course loses a timeout. That could be big, given that Pittsburgh already has taken two timeouts.
9:14: Looked like Brett Swain had a first-down catch for GB, but then Timmons rips it loose and it's ruled incomplete. Mike McCarthy will challenge that one, so get ready for a delay.
9:12: Rodgers dumps it and was very lucky not to take a sack. 3rd and 10 for GB now.
9:11: With the penalty, GB starts at its 13, and is incomplete on first down as Rodgers throws behind Quarless.
9:10: Another penalty on GB, and thie one was a dumb one. Tramon Williams got frustrated on the punt and whacked a Steeler in the helmet with his hand. That's 45 yards in penalties for GB in the second half.
9:09: Quick out to Mike Wallace. Pitt looking at 3rd-and-2 . . . and can't convert. Ben is high to Wallace on the left side, but it was catchable, and now Pitt punts. GB will start at its 25.
9:07: GB incomplete on third down. Pack will punt rather than go for a 56-yard FG. Pitt will start on its 13.
9:04: GB is facing 3rd-and-8, but it's the Steelers who have to use their second timeout of the half. Only one left in the bank for Pittsburgh now. Not a good situation to be in when you're playing from behind. About 2:30 left in the third quarter.
9:03: Good stat from Fox. GB has 30 penalty yards this half, and only 17 on offense. But there's an 18-yard strike to Nelson to get the Pack going.
9:00. Sack. Zombo nails Roethlisberger back at the 35. Pitt will try a 52-yard field goal . . . And it's not even close. Pitt still trails by 4, and GB will start at its 34.
8:59: Clay Matthews gets a chunk of the ball and deflects a Roethlisberger pass that's nearly picked off. Second and 10 . . . And then it gets worse for Pitt, as Heath Miller loses a couple on a reception. 3rd and 13.
8:57: There's Hines Ward's fifth catch of the night, to get Pittsburgh inside the GB 30.
8:55: Pitt converts and then goes deep on first down, but Ben throws too long for Wallace. Steelers are at the GB 45. Could have been 6.
8:52: Oops. Pittsburgh has to take a timeout as the play contact ticks too fast. Remember that, if the Steelers need a timeout they don't have in the late going.
8:51: Mendenhall for not very much. And then Wallace catches one in the flat for maybe 8. Third and a tad coming up.
8:49: 9 minutes left in the third quarter. Pittsburgh will start at its 40. Commercial time.
8:48: Rodgers sacked by James Harrison on third down. GB will have to punt from deep in its own territory, and momentum appears to have flipped.
8:47: GB drive starts at the Packer 18. Starks gets a few. Can hear the fans now, and it sounds like a Pittsburgh crowd. Aikman is saying GB may need to go to a silent count. Jordy Nelson just got his second drop of the game.
8:44: Now it gets interesting. Remember that as good as these teams are, neither one was very good in the second half of their conference championships.
8:43: Mendenhall is back in the game after that sideline collision, and goes straight in for the touchdown. Nearly untouched. PAT is good and now it's 21-17.
8:42: Nice cutback by Isaac Redman. Steelers inside the GB 10. First and goal at the 8.
8:41: Ben scrambles to get Pitt to 3rd-and-1 at the GB 23.
8:40: Penalty puts Steelers at midfield to begin their first drive of the second half. Mendenhall busts loose on the right side, but took a shot in a sideline collision with a camera guy. Ouch! But Pitt is near the GB 30.
8:36: Third Packers penalty of the second half already, and it's a biggie. Face mask personal foul on Crabtree.
8:35: James Jones can't handle a bullet pass on 3rd-and-5. That one might have gone the distance. GB punts.
8:34: Another flag on GB to start the second half. False start on Jennings. Second and 15.
8:33: And Sanders is out for Pittsburgh with a foot injury.
8:32: Holding penalty to start for GB, leaves them at first and 20.
8:31: Touchback. Woodson is out for GB with a collarbone injury. Time to pick on his sub when Pitt gets the ball, don't you think?
8:27: Halftime show is history and we'll be ready for kickoff in a minute or so. Greeb Bay will get the ball to start the second half.
8:12: Here's more video. This one is of that Nelson TD catch for GB.
8:02: Halftime stats: Aaron Rodgers, 11-16-137, 2 TDs, 0 int. Roethlisberger, 13-21-143, 1 TD, 2 picks. Starks has 37 yards on 7 rushes and Nelson has 63 yards on 4 catches for GB. Mendenhall has 30 rushing yards on 8 carries; Randle El has 50 yards on 2 catches and Hines Wards has 43 yards on four catches for Pitt.
7:59: Touchback. Looks like Green Bay will be conservative. Starks runs for 3 . . . And that's it. Green Bay up 21-10 at the half.
7:58: :39 left in half. PAT good. Green Bay still up, but only by 21-10 now.
7:57: Touchdown Steelers. Hines Ward again, in the right corner of the end zone. Looked like an ad lib.
7:56: Ptt gets a yard. 2nd-and-9 at the 25, and Ben finds Hines Ward again, for 18 yards, to set up first and goal.
7:55: Hines Ward makes a good grab to let Pitt convert on 3rd-and-10. Woodson has headed for the GB locker room. Pitt at the GB 26, 1:37 left.
7:52: Woodson defends on a deep throw to Wallace, but comes up hurting. GB will take a timeout (its second) and assess what's up with their defensive star. And here's video of Collins' touchdown return of a pick for GB.
7:48: Pitt responds as Randle El hauls in a high throw on the sideline and takes the Steelers to about the GB 40.
7:49: Pitt will start at its 23. 2:18 left in the first half. You have to believe GB will bring the heat here.
7:47: That gives Green Bay 14 points scored off of Roethlisberger interceptions.
7:45: Touchdown Green Bay. Rodgers fires a bullet through traffic to Jennings about a yard deep in the end zone. PAT good.
7:44: 17-yard catch for Jordy Nelson. That gives him 4 grabs for 63 yards.
7:42: Another interception on Roethlisberger. Jarrett Bush battles Mike Wallace for the ball and comes up with it for Green Bay. Pack will have the ball around midfield. A little more than 4 minutes left.
7:39: Steelers take their first timeout, facing 2nd-and-11.
7:38: Pitt still doesn't have a downfield play. On 3rd-and-6 Randle El makes a nice dive down low for a first down. Steelers just beyond midfield.
7:36: Moore bulls for a first down. Pitt is at its 35, and Roethlisberger scrambles for 5.
7:34: Heath Miller hold negates a good Pitt run. Steelers face first and 20, and they get most of it back with a 16-yard pass to Wallace.
7:33: Some stats: Rodgers is 8-13-96; Roethlisberger 6-11-37. Starks has 21 yards on 5 carries. Mendenhall has 31 on 7 totes.
7:31: Looks like Donald Driver might have twisted a knee on the last catch. Commercial time.
7:30: Packers face 3rd-and-5. Driver makes the catch but is short. Pitt will get the ball. About 9:40 left in the second quarter.
7:28: Pack will start at about the 25 . . . but first, more commercials. haven't seen a really memorable one so far. What do our readers think?
7:23: Complete to Wallace, but way short of the first down. Pitt will kick the FG from 33 yards out .... and it's good. Steelers have their first points.
7:21: Sanders back out there . . . Mendenhall gets a yard, and Pitt faces 3rd and 7 as Sanders goes off again.
7:20: Pitt converts on a good throw to Sanders, who comes off the field limping.
7:19: Flozell Adams back on the field for the Steelers. Pitt incomplete on 2nd and 12 and facing a long one to convert.
7:15: Roethlisberger limping, but not coming off. Looks like it's the left knee as he tries to convert 3rd-and-9 . . . And so much for that concern, as Big Ben scrambles for a first down.
7:14: Pitt is near midfield after a short completion. Flozell Adams hurt now for Steelers, too.
7:10: On the interception, Howard Green was pressuring Roethlisberger, in the end zone.
7:09: The interception return was 37 yards, the PAT is good and Green Bay leads 14-0.
7:08: Pick six for Green Bay. Nick Collins leaps for an interception and returns it all the way. There's a flag down, but that's because the Collins celebrated a bit too much.
7:07: Steelers CB Bryant McFadden has a hip injury and his return is questionable, according to Pitt blog.
7:04: Flag on the kickoff. Steelers called for a clip, and lose Antonio Brown's big return.
7:01. Touchdown Green Bay. Rodgers finds Jordy Nelson down the right sideline, beating William Gay.
7:00: More heat on Rodgers, but he survives agin. Third and one at the Pitt 29.
6:59: Rodgers gets some heat but finds Brandon Jackson for another GB first down . . . And Fox just showed us A-Rod being fed popcorn by Cameron Diaz. Football, please.
6:56: Anybody else think it's a little early for Joe Buck and Troy Aikman to be plugging the halftime show? Commercial time.
6:55: Starks picks up another first down. That's two for the rookie.
6:54: Starks barrels wide right for the first down. Pack is at its 37.
6:54: Redemption for Jordy Nelson after that earlier whiff. Nice catch, for third and inches.
6:53: Aaron Rodgers bomb to Jennings, but nothing there. 2ns and 10. About 8 minutes left in the first quarter.
6:49: Pack gets off the field on third down again. Punt sails to the end zone. Commercial time.
6:48: Steelers' first gaffe. david Johnson called for a false start. Second and 15.
6:47: Mendenhall takes the same route for 9 more yards.
6:46: Mendenhall runs for Pitt's first first down, 15 yard tote.
6:43: Jordy Nelson has a paydirt pass go right through his hands. That hurts. Packers punt into the end zone. Pitt's ball at the 20 when we come back.
6:42: 2nd and 10, Starks gets 3 to the GB 49.
6:40: 21-yard completion, and Pitt's blitz doesn't faze the Packers. First down at the GB 46.
6:39: Incomplete and a 1-yard gain on GB's first two plays.
6:38: First big play. Tramon Williams muffs the punt . . . but Green Bay recovers. Pack will start at the 21.
6:37: Three and out on Pitt's first position. Nice move by the Pack to defer on the kickoff.
6:36: Ben connects with Hines Ward on first down. Second and 6 . . . But loss of four for Mendenhall on second down.
6:34: Here we go. Good return of the opening kickoff by Antonio Brown for Pittsburgh. And just remember, if the NFL operated the way the BCS does we'd be watching the Falcons playing the Patriots right now.
6:30: Green Bay won the toss, but defers. Pittsburgh got to make the call, and took tails, which on the coin meant the image of the stadium. I'm guessing Jerry Jones isn't happy that his palatial stadium was designated for tails.
