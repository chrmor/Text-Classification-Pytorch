Israel warplanes attack Gaza target after rockets-witnesses
GAZA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Israeli warplanes raided at least two targets in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Palestinian witnesses and Hamas officials said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties in the attacks, one of which sent plumes of smoke shooting into the air in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, witnesses said.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment but the strikes were reported after Israel had said at least seven rockets and mortars were fired from Hamas-ruled Gaza at Israel.
The Popular Resistance Committees, a Palestinian militant group, claimed responsibility for mortar fire, saying it was in retaliation for Israelâ€™s killing of two militant leaders of an al-Qaeda linked group in Gaza on Wednesday.
