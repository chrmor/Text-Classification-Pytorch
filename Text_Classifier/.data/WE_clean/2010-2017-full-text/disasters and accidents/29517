More rain expected as Thailand flood death toll rises to 40
Thailand faces more hardship from unseasonable floods that have killed 40 people in its south, with more rain expected in the major rubber-producing and tourist region in coming days, a top disaster agency official said on Sunday.
Persistent heavy rain well into what should be the dry season has triggered floods across the south, cutting road and rail links, threatening crops and affecting about 1.6 million people, said Chatchai Promlert, head of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department.
"The worst isn't over. We're expecting more rain this week while clean-up efforts are underway in places where the waters have subsided," Chatchai told Reuters.
The Meteorological Department said on its website more rain was expected on Monday.
The rainy season in Thailand normally takes place from June to November. The floods, which began on Jan. 1, have followed unseasonably heavy rain.
