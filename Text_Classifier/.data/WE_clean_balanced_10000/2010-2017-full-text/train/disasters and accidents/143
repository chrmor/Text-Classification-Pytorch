8 dead, 60 injured
At least eight people were killed and dozens more injured after multiple tornadoes ripped through Oklahoma on Tuesday, including a massive twister that left a trail of damage 50 miles long.
Cherokee Ballard, spokeswoman for the state medical examiner, said the death toll has risen to eight. About 6 a.m. Wednesday morning she learned from a hospital that a child has died. She did not know in what county or hospital the child died.
Ballard also said the fatalities include four deaths in Canadian County, two deaths in Logan County, one death in Grady County and the child's death.
There were reports of fatalities in other parts of the state, but those were unconfirmed, Ballard said. At least four major tornadoes touched down, causing damage from Grady County northeast to Logan County, National Weather Service forecasters said.
