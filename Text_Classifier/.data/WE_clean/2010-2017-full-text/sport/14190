17-year-old Indonesian boxer Tubagus Sakti dies of brain haemorrhage
A 17-year-old Indonesian boxer has died of a brain haemorrhage after losing a fight.
Tubagus Sakti suffered convulsions and was rushed to hospital following his eighth round technical knock-out defeat to Ical Tobida in a bout for the vacant KTPI junior flyweight title at the TVRI studio in Jakarta on Sunday.
It was later confirmed that the teenager had died of a brain haemorrhage in hospital, according to a report by the Indonesian language newspaper Kompas.
Cornered by his opponent in the eighth round, Tubagus raised both his hands in the air to signify that he had given up. However, the referee failed to stop Ical from landing several clean blows to Tubagusâ€™s head before stopping the fight.
