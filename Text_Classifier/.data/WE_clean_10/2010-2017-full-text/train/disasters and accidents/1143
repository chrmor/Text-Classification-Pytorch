Thunderstorms Roll Across Midwest; 1 Dead in Kentucky Flood
One person was killed and several others were missing as a band of severe thunderstorms put millions of Americans in the path of damaging winds and heavy rain, forecasters said Tuesday.
At least one tornado touched down late Monday in Hutchinson, Kansas, while baseball-sized hail was reported near Chicago and heavy rain triggered flash floods in Kentucky. A derecho swept across several states, according to The Weather Channel.
The storms were moving toward the Southeast on Tuesday, with an area from the Ohio Valley, Kentucky and Tennessee down to northern Alabama most at risk, according to the National Weather Service.
Up to 67 million people were at risk from high winds, with a flash flooding a growing concern â€” especially in Kentucky, which was already battered by devastating flooding on Monday.
