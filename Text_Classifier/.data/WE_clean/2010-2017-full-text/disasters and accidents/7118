UN agency: Japan underestimated tsunami hazard for nuclear plants
TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Japan underestimated the tsunami hazard for its nuclear plants, a U.N. nuclear safety team in Japan said on Wednesday in a summary of its report on the nuclear crisis triggered by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
“The tsunami hazard for several sites was underestimated,” the three-page summary said, adding that the incident at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s Fukushima plant showed that nuclear plants need a “hardened” emergency response centre to deal with accidents.
“Nuclear plant designers and operators should appropriately evaluate and provide protection against the risks of all natural hazards,” it said.
It urged Japanese authorities to follow up with monitoring of public and workers’ health.
The full report will be presented to an international meeting in Vienna on June 20-24.
“The planned road map for recovery of the stricken reactors is important and acknowledged. It will need modification as new circumstances are uncovered and may be assisted by international cooperation,” the summary said.
Representatives of the IAEA team include nuclear safety experts from France, Russia, China and the United States.
Experts are still trying to understand how events at the Fukushima Daiichi plant on Japan’s Pacific coast, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, spiralled out of control after the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
