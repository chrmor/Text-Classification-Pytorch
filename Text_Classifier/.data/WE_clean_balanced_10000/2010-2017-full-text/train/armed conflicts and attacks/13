Video: Ankara explosion: Turkish president vows war on terror as officials say one bomber was 'female Kurdish militant'
Turkey has been hit by another car bombing in the heart of its capital just weeks after an attack on a military convoy killed 29, raising fears that violence in the country's south east will lead to further chaos.
On Sunday night, at least 37 people were killed and 125 wounded after an explosion in the capital's transit hub in Kizilay close to Guven park, Mehmet Muezzinoglu, the health minister, said. At least two of those killed were the attackers, the minister said on Sunday.
The next day, he confirmed the death toll had risen from 34 to 37 and currently 71 were still in hospital. Fifteen are in a serious condition.
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed a war against terrorism, promising that the security forces would bring terrorism to "its knees".
"Our people should not worry, the struggle against terrorism will for certain end in success and terrorism will be brought to its knees."
The Ankara provincial governor's office confirmed it was a car "packed with explosives close to Kizilay square". On Monday afternoon, the popular Turkish football team, Galatasaray, confirmed that the father of striker Umut Bulut was killed during the attack.
Live images from the scene showed burnt-out vehicles as ambulances rushed to the scene. Footage later appeared online showing the moment of the attack with people running away and sparks flying.
No group has yet claimed the attack. But a security official told Reuters news agency they believed Kurdish militant group, Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), were behind the bombing.
"According to initial findings, it seems that this attack has been carried out either by the PKK or an affiliated organisation."
On Monday, a senior government official told news agencies that it was believed that the bombing was carried out by two terrorists - one of them a woman and member of PKK - and was the work of Kurdish militants.
The security official told Reuters news agency that the woman, born in 1992 and from Kars, eastern Turkey, joined the group in 2013.
Efkan Ala, the interior minister, said the government would not say which group they believed was responsible for the attack until Monday.
"I believe the investigation will be concluded tomorrow and the findings will be announced," he said.
On Sunday night a court in Ankara ordered a ban on access to Facebook and Twitter in the country after images from the attack were widely shared, local media reported.
Aftermath of the explosion in Ankara
The country has been hit by a spate of deadly bombings including its worst attack in the capital late last year during which 103 people were killed after a twin suicide bombing by Isil-linked terrorists.
Last month's attack killed dozens of military personnel and was initially blamed by Turkish authorities on Syrian Kurdish militants linked to homegrown Kurdish guerrilla fighters.
But later, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (Tak), formerly linked to PKK, claimed the attack in response to security operations in the south-east.
The Australian ambassador to Ankara described his distressing ordeal after he and his 12-year-old daughter were in a car 65 feet away when the bombing happened on the other side of traffic lights they had been waiting at.
James Larsen told ABC News that he heard a "pop" and saw flames as well as vehicles burning.
"As is always the case with these instances, you hear a pop, and then of course, we saw flames shooting up and a bus and car catching alight and flames spreading out," he told 7.30.
"It was very distressing. There was a great deal of movement amongst the people around; it was a very, very crowded area.
"I said to my daughter 'make sure you put your head down low in the car on the floor' so she was away from any glass.
"I moved the car to the side of the roadway and called the office to make sure that we initiated our crisis procedures."
The blast on Sunday came two days after the US embassy warned its citizens that there was information about a "potential terrorist plot to attack Turkish government buildings and housing located in the Bahcelievler area of Ankara".
The embassy warned its citizens to avoid the area. In the worst attack late last year, two Isil-linked suicide bombers launched their attack during a peace rally in the capital. Organisers and activists were calling for an end to fighting between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants after the collapse of the ceasefire earlier in the year.
The city suffered another attack last month when 29 people were killed after a car bomb blamed on Kurdish militants. The majority of those killed during the recent attack were military personnel after their convoy was hit by the blast.
Sources told Hurriyet Daily News that Mr Erdogan was briefed on the attack by Mr Ela and Ahmet Davutoglu, the prime minister, chaired an emergency meeting with security chiefs after the attack.
Mr Erdogan, who is currently in Istanbul, is due to return to the capital. On Sunday night, he said Turkey had become a target of terror attacks because of regional instability.
"Terrorist organisations are using the instability as a tool and they target our innocent citizens in the most depraved way."
