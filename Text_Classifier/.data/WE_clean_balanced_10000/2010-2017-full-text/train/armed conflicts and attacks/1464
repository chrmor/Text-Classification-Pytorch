According to a police statement: "A border police officer noticed a female terrorist who drew his suspicion along Haim Bar Lev Road and called out to her to stop.
"The terrorist continued walking and when she realized he was approaching her she turned to face him with a knife and stabbed him."
"The officer, who acted with great professionalism, managed to aim his weapon and neutralize her," the statement added.
It is the second stabbing in the capital, following an attempted stabbing in Jerusalem's Old City, close to the Lion's Gate.
In that attack, the terrorist was shot dead after stabbing a border police officer in his flak jacket. His intended victim thankfully emerged unscathed.
