Three-quarters of Queensland a disaster zone
Three-quarters of Queensland has now been declared a disaster zone, as the state comes to grips with devastating and deadly floods.
Warning that flood levels in Brisbane this week could be worse than the 1974 event, Premier Anna Bligh said the disaster continued to develop “at a frightening pace”.
Ms Bligh said disaster declarations had been made for the Brisbane, Bundaberg, Dalby, Gladstone, Gold Coast, Gympie, Ipswich, Logan, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Roma, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, Warwick and Redcliffe disaster districts, representing three-quarters of the state.
“The declaration of a disaster situation gives our police and emergency personnel authority to evacuate members of the public as necessary to ensure the preservation of life and property,” she said in a statement.
At least nine people have so far been confirmed dead and 66 are unaccounted for, following a deluge west of Brisbane yesterday.
Ms Bligh said as rain continued to fall, local and state-level disaster management personnel were working to ensure the preparedness and safety of the community.
