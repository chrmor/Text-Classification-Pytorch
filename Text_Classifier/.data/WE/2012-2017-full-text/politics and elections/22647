SANAA, Yemen (AP) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross says a staff member has been killed in a shooting in Yemen.
ICRC said on its Twitter account the incident took place early Saturday, without elaborating.
Yemeni security officials said the Hanna Lahoud of Lebanon was killed in the southwestern province of Taiz when gunmen shot at a vehicle carrying ICRC staff members. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.
It was not immediately clear how many people were in the vehicle and if there were other casualties.
Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since March 2015 pitting a Saudi-led coalition backing an internationally recognized government against Shiite rebels, known as Houthis. The stalemated war has rendered Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
