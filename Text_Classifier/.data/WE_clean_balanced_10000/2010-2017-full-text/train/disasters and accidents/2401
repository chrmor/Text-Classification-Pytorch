Monsoon Rains and Flash Floods Kill More Than 200 in India, Pakistan
Heavy monsoon rains and flash floods have killed 128 people in Pakistan and 108 people in India, officials said Saturday, as forecasters warned of more rain in the coming days and troops raced to evacuate people from deluged areas. The annual monsoon season has struck hard across the region, leaving people to wade through rushing water in towns and villages across Pakistan and in Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir, where authorities say they are seeing some of the worst flooding in decades. Ahmad Kamal, a spokesman for Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, said officials believe all those were killed when the roofs of their homes collapsed. He said the deluge has injured 148 people across the country.
In India, authorities put the death toll at 108 people, including some 30 people killed when a bus filled with those attending wedding washed away in a flooded stream. Four passengers managed to swim away, but around 30 others remain unaccounted for, officials said. Authorities fear the death toll may rise in the region as more flooding and rain is forecast for the coming days.
