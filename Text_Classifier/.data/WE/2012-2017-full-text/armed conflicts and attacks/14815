Egypt secures 'full control' of North Sinai: Spokesperson
Egypt's armed forces have gained full control over the North Sinai areas of Arish, Rafah and Sheikh Zuwaid after successful raids on terrorist strongholds and weapons caches, the Egyptian army spokesman announced on Thursday
Egypt has killed 20 militants in North Sinai, wounded 12 and detained 78 more in joint police and army raids, he said, without specifying when they occurred. 
His statement also mentions that Egyptian forces dismantled 51 explosive devices and destroyed motorcycles used to monitor troops' movements and six SUV vehicles fitted with machine guns.
The Egyptian military also stated that it has destroyed eight hideouts containing some 1000 kilograms of explosives, 4000 litres of gas and three tons of cannabis, as well as seizing collections of books with jihadist ideology.
Twenty underground shelters used for hiding individuals and vehicles were also destroyed.
On 7 October Egypt's armed forces announced the commencement of the second stage of Martyr’s Right, its most recent North Sinai operation.
Martyr's Right is the largest and most comprehensive operation aimed at rooting out and killing terrorists in Sinai yet. ISIS-affiliated militants mounted their largest attack in months on Egypt's security forces in July.
