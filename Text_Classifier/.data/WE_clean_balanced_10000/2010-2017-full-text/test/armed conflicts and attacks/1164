Members of the Takfiri ISIL group have executed more than a dozen women in Iraq’s embattled northern city of Mosul as they continue perpetrating crimes on a large scale in the areas under their control. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) spokesman in Mosul, Saeed Mamouzini, told Arabic-language al-Sumaria satellite television network that ISIL extremists killed 15 women in Ghazlani military base, which lies near the city and is located some 400 kilometers (248 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad, on Saturday after the victims refused to marry the militants. Mamouzini added that ISIL members have murdered more than 30 Iraqi women over the past two months after they turned down proposals to marry the terrorists. Late last month, ISIL militants executed 19 women in Mosul on the same ground. Hana Nawafili, a spokeswoman for the Iraqi Observatory for the Defense of Battered Women, told Arabic-language al-Maalomah news agency on July 18 that ISIL terrorists had gang-raped seven female residents of Fallujah, situated about 69 kilometers (43 miles) west of Baghdad, and then murdered them. Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights reported on December 16, 2014, that ISIL terrorists had executed at least 150 women, including pregnant ones, in the country’s western province of al-Anbar, after they declined to marry the Takfiris. The ministry further noted that the militants buried the women in mass graves in Fallujah.
