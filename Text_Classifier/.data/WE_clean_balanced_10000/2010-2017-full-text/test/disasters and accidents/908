Hungary opens criminal investigation into toxic sludge flood
Hundreds of people had to be evacuated after a gigantic sludge reservoir burst Monday at a metals plant in Ajka, a town 100 miles southwest of Budapest, the capital.
Zoltan Illes, the environment minister, said the clean-up of the country’s worst chemical accident would probably take up to a year as well as require technical and financial assistance from the European Union. The EU has already express concern that the flood could turn into an ecological disaster for several nations and has urged Hungarian authorities to focus all efforts on keeping the sludge from the Danube river.
The red tide, which inundated streets and homes after the walls of residue reservoir at an aluminium plant collapsed, has so far killed four people and injured 120, but the death toll is expected to rise.
Six people are missing and another eight are in critical condition in hospital, suffering from chemical burns. The sludge is a mixture of water and mining waste containing heavy metals and is considered highly dangerous.
In some places the torrent, which swept cars off roads and damaged bridges, was eight feet deep.
It is estimated that 38.8 million cubic feet (the equivalent of 440 Olympic-size swimming pools) of red, poisonous sludge has affected some 15 square miles. A spokesman for Greenpeace International said the spill is “one of the top three environmental disasters in Europe in the last 20 or 30 years.”
