Germany marks reunification celebrations
Germany on Sunday celebrated 20 years since reunification when the capitalist West and the communist East merged after decades of Cold War division that ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Several hundred thousand people were expected in the northern city of Bremen for a series of street parties and official events led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, herself brought up in East Germany.
In a video podcast on the eve of the celebrations, Merkel paid tribute to East Germans for having "the courage to fight for freedom."
"At the same time, there was a huge wave of solidarity from the people in West Germany. It is thanks to these joint efforts that we have been able to rebuild so quickly and make Germany a country that is respected in the World."
Also expected to attend the reunification celebrations were European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
US President Barack Obama was quick to congratulate Germany, praising "the courage and conviction of the German people that brought down the Berlin Wall, ending decades of painful and artificial separation."
