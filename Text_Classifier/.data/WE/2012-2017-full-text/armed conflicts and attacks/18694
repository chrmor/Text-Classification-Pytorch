Malaysia Links Nightclub Attack to Islamic State
BANGKOK — A grenade attack at a nightclub in Malaysia last week was the work of the Islamic State, and two men who received instructions from a fighter for the group have been arrested, the Malaysian authorities said on Monday.
The attack early last Tuesday in the town of Puchong, near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, injured eight people and was thought to have been the first assault in Malaysia tied to the Islamic State.
Khalid Abu Bakar, Malaysia’s inspector general of police, said at a news conference that the two suspects had been ordered to carry out attacks by a known Islamic State fighter from Malaysia, whom he identified as Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi.
“The two of those arrested had received instructions from Muhammad Wanndy, who had commanded them to carry out attacks in Malaysia on our government leaders, top police officials and judges,” Mr. Khalid said.
The police have arrested 15 people, including two police officers, in connection with the assault on the Movida nightclub, Reuters reported. Two more suspects were being sought.
The police initially said they believed that the attack was gang related or had been prompted by a business dispute. But after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for it on Facebook, the police refocused their investigation.
