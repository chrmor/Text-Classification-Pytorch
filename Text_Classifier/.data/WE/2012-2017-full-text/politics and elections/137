China warns Iran against nuclear weapons
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 20 (UPI) -- China is warning Iran against developing nuclear weapons, observers said.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, on a visit the Middle East, appeared to be trying to send Iran the message that China will not alienate itself from the rest of the world with regard to Iran, a foreign policy expert told Britain's Daily Telegraph.
The Washington Post said China cut its oil imports from Iran this month nearly in half to 285,000 barrels a day.
"Iran would not have wanted China to make this statement, but Iran must understand that if it comes down to a choice China will not alienate itself from the rest of the world for the sake of a single country," Yu Guoqing, a researcher on the Middle East at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Telegraph.
On Wednesday, Wen said China opposed Iran's threats to blockade an important oil-transport route through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has threatened to close the strait if an oil embargo is imposed against the country.
