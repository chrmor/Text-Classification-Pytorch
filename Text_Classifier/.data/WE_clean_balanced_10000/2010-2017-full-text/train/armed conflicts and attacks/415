Muammar Gaddafi facing war crimes arrest warrant
Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the ICC prosecutor, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that widespread and systematic attacks by Gaddafi's forces had been carried out and were continuing.
He said he would seek arrest warrants against the three Libyans who bear "the greatest criminal responsibility" for crimes against humanity committed in retaliation to pro-democracy uprisings.
Strong evidence of repeated shootings of peaceful protestors, as well as the "systematic" rape, arrest, torture and killing of other civilians had been discovered, Mr Moreno-Ocampo told the council.
"War crimes are apparently committed as a matter of policy," a report by his team of investigators said following a two-month inquiry.
Gaddafi unleashed a brutal crackdown on demonstrators who held protests against his despotic rule following the wave of uprisings across the middle east earlier this year.
The country has since descended into civil war in which thousands of people have been killed. Nato forces are engaged in air strikes against facilities in Tripoli.
"The victims who were shot at by the security forces were unarmed civilians and there is no evidence of any attack against the security forces," Mr Moreno-Ocampo said in New York.
"There are at least two eyewitnesses for each incident, documents, and, in many cases, corroboration of details by pictures or video."
Mr Moreno-Ocampo did not identify the three individuals set to face arrest warrants, but it is widely assumed that Gaddafi, the Libyan leader for the past 42 years, will be among them. Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's brother-in-law and intelligence chief, may also be included.
The prosecutor is expected to name those involved when presenting his case to the ICC's pre-trial chamber in The Hague later this month.
It will either issue arrest warrants, reject the application or ask for more evidence. If ever arrested and convicted, Gaddafi faces multiple life sentences.
