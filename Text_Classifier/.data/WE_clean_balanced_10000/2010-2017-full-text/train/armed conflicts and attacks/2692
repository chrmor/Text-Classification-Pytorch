Gunfire Kills Three Sudanese Officers in Darfur, UN Reports
Shootings between an unidentified rebel group and government forces in Sudan’s western region of Darfur left three officers dead, the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping mission said.
The incident took place on Jan. 15 in the town of Nertiti, 63 kilometers (39 miles) east of Zalingei, in West Darfur state, the mission, known as UNAMID, said in an e-mailed statement today.
“A UNAMID team established from the local authorities that the shooting was triggered by a rebel whose faction is yet to be identified,” Chris Cycmanick, a spokesman for the mission, said by phone from its headquarters in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.
One officer from the National Intelligence and Security Service, known as NISS, was killed when violence broke out. “Further tension with an exchange of fire” took place when government forces conducted a house-to-house search. A policeman and another security service officer were killed, according to the statement.
Violence in Darfur exploded in 2003 when rebels took up arms, accusing the authorities in the Sudanese capital Khartoum of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7 million people to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.
