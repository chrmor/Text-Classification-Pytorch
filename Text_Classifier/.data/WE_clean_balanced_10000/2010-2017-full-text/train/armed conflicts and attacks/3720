At Least 15 Killed in Raid on Pakistan Border
Military officials in Pakistan say 14 militants and one soldier have been killed in an ambush on a border post in the restive northwestern tribal area. The military says the insurgents crossed the border from Afghanistan early Saturday morning. The attack took place in the Bajur tribal region, triggering a gunbattle that lasted for hours, with helicopter gunships being sent in for backup. A spokesman said two soldiers had been wounded and the death toll could rise. Pakistan and Afghanistan share a volatile and porous border and militants from both nations cross the border to use the neighboring country as a safe haven.
