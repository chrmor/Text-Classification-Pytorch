Earthquake in Russia’s Far East Prompts Evacuations
An 8.3-magnitude earthquake struck Russia’s Far East on Friday, sending tremors that prompted evacuations as far away as Moscow, more than 4,000 miles to the west of the epicenter. The United States Geological Survey recorded the earthquake at 5:44 p.m. local time at a depth of approximately 373 miles below the Sea of Okhotsk, off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russian news media reported that reverberations from the earthquake rattled furniture and sent books toppling off of bookshelves in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and officials initially told residents on Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to reach higher ground in case of a tsunami. Russia’s Emergency Ministry later lifted the tsunami warning, and said in a statement that no injuries had been reported. Tremors were felt in more than a dozen regions spanning Russia; in Moscow, local law enforcement officers evacuated 850 people from two apartment buildings after residents said the buildings were shaking.
