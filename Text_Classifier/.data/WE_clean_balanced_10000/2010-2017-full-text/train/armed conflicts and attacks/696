Libya protests: Rescuers find 7 'buried alive in Gaddafi's compound' in Benghazi
Rebel forces claim to have rescued seven emaciated prisoners who had been buried alive in an underground cell in Libya.
The group of men were apparently found in a sealed room in Benghazi's government compound after it was overrun by rebel fighters.
Rescuers claim they heard voices underground and dug through freshly laid concrete to find the men, some of whom were barely alive Sky News reported.
The men were believed to have been anti-Gaddafi protesters or soldiers who had rebelled against the Libyan dictator.
The compound, off limits during Colonel Gaddafi's 40 years in power, has revealed a labyrinth of bunkers, prisons and armouries.
It was the Libyan leader's stronghold in the east of the country and is said to have been heavily armed.
Among the debris were boxes for anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades and the tunnels were so large armoured vehicles could have been driven through them.
Parts of the compound have now been destroyed by looters and rebels, but there are rumours it was connected to Gaddafi's mansion outside the town by tunnels.
Graffiti has been daubed all over the complex, which also featured an exit tunnel and scores of prison cells.
It comes after video footage emerged of Gaddafi's second son, Saif al-Islam, urging loyalists to fight 'to the last bullet'.
The recording, near Green Square in Tripoli, shows Saif brandishing a rifle as he spoke to a crowd of supporters.
He has previously claimed to be a 'moderate' who would reform the country.
