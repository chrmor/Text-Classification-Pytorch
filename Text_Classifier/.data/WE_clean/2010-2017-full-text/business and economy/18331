General Motors Recalls 2.4 Million More Vehicles
The latest action brings to 13.6 million the number of vehicles GM has recalled in this year, a new record for the automaker. GM’s previous record of 10.75 million cars and trucks was set in 2004, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
GM agreed last week to pay a $35 million federal fine for concealing deadly defects in small-car ignition switches for more than a decade. The company says at least 13 people have died in crashes linked to the problem, but trial lawyers suing the company say the death toll is at least 53.
GM said no fatalities were linked to the recalls announced Tuesday.
As part of the fallout from that recall of 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars, GM hired more safety investigators and vowed to review the safety of its vehicles. In May alone, GM has recalled nearly 5.3 million cars and trucks.
The Detroit automaker said it will take a $400 million charge for repairs on all vehicles recalled so far this quarter. That’s on top of a $1.3 billion charge the automaker took for recalls in the first quarter.
GM said no fatalities have been reported related to the recalls announced Tuesday. The recalls are:
— 1.3 million Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia crossovers from the 2009-2014 model years and Saturn Outlook crossovers from 2009-2010. GM says the front safety lap belt cables can wear down and separate over time. GM has told dealers they cannot sell new or used models of the vehicles until repairs are made.
— 1.1 million Chevrolet Malibu sedans from the 2004-2008 model years and Pontiac G6 sedans from 2005-2008 because a shift cable could wear out over time. If the fracture occurs, the driver may not be able to select a different gear, remove the key from the ignition or place the transmission in park. GM knows of 18 crashes and one injury from the defect.
— 1,402 Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESVs from the 2015 model year because a faulty weld could result in partial deployment of the front passenger air bag in a crash. GM has stopped the sale of the models and alerted 224 current owners not to let occupants sit in the front passenger seat until the vehicle has been repaired. GM knows of no injuries related to the defect.
— 58 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD pickups from the 2015 model year because retention clips attaching the generator fuse block to the vehicle body can become loose and lead to a potential fire. No crashes or injuries are related to the defect.
