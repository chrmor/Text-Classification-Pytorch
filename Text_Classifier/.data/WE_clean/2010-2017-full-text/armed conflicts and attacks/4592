Thai soldier killed in Cambodia border clash
A Thai soldier has been shot dead and four wounded in clashes with Cambodian troops in a disputed border area.
It is the latest sign of rising tensions near the Preah Vihear temple, where both sides are moving in troops.
Cambodia has told the UN the situation at the border is becoming "explosive", AFP news agency reports.
On Friday, a Cambodian soldier and a Thai civilian were reported to have been killed in an incident described by Cambodia as an "invasion".
The Thai military said it had been a misunderstanding. The two-hour exchange for fire was the most serious incident on the border for some time.
A Cambodian government spokesman blamed the encroachment of Thai soldiers for the fighting and said a complaint would be sent to the UN Security Council.
The fighting ended with both sides confirming a ceasefire, but there was another eruption of violence early on Saturday.
"One Thai soldier was killed by shrapnel and four were injured in a clash lasting about 30 minutes early this morning," said Col Sunsern Kaewkumnerd.
The two countries' foreign ministers had been meeting in Cambodia to discuss the long-running border dispute when the fighting started.
The Thai nationalist "yellow-shirt" movement has called on its government to take a harder line on the issue with its smaller neighbour.
It is planning a demonstration in front of Cambodia's embassy in Bangkok later on Saturday.
On Saturday, Cambodia's Foreign Minister Hor Namhong wrote to the UN to draw attention to "the explosive situation at the border", AFP reports.
The letter did not ask for UN assistance, but claims Thailand had been the aggressor.
"Cambodian troops had no option but to retaliate in self-defence," the letter read.
There has been tension in the region ever since Cambodia secured the World Heritage listing of the Preah Vihear temple in 2008.
This caused joy in Cambodia, and anguish in Thailand - which once claimed the temple.
