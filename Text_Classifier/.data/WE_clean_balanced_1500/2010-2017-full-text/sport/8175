What time does London Marathon 2015 start today?
The 35th London Marathon gets underway from three different starting points around Greenwich Park and Blackheath this morning.
The various races will start at four different timeslots within just over an hour.
The elite wheelchair race kicks off proceedings at 9.00am, followed by athletes competing in the IPC Athletics Marathon World Championships at 9.05am. The elite women's race then starts at 9.20am.
Finally, both the elite men's race and the mass race begin at 10.10am.

All runners are destined for the same finish line, which this year will once again be on The Mall, near Buckingham Palace. With the capital's closed roads set to reopen at 7.00pm, the runners should all have ample time to make it round the 26-mile course.
The first of the elite athletes should be finished before lunchtime, with defending women's champion (and likely favourite for this year) Edna Kiplagat of Kenya having set her personal best of 2:19.50 on this course in 2012.
The men will not be far behind either, with defending Kenyan titleholder Wilson Kipsang sure to be pushed hard by compatriot and world record holder Dennis Kimetto.
Paula Radcliffe, in her final London Marathon, may be some way further behind. The British distance-running legend will run with the main field rather than the elite women, and will be thankful just to make it to the finish after a tough and long-running battle through injuries.
