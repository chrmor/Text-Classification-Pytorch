At Least 12 Killed By Bombings In, Around Baghdad
Three bombings in and around Baghdad have killed at least 12 people -- including a suicide car bombing in a mainly Shiâ€™ite neighborhood to the north of the Iraqi capital that had been attacked the day before.
Six police and two civilians were killed and 11 people wounded by the July 13 suicide bombing at a checkpoint in Rashidiya, just north of Baghdad.
A suicide bombing on July 12 at an outdoor vegetable and fruit market in Rashidiya killed 12 people.
Police say two separate bombings in Baghdad on July 13 killed four civilians and wounded 16.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, although the Islamic State (IS) group has carried out many similar bombings in the capital and other parts of Iraq.
A bomb attack claimed by IS on July 3 killed nearly 300 people -- one of the worst suicide bombings in Iraq since U.S. forces ousted dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- an incident that resulted in a public outcry in Baghdad over the government's inability to secure Iraq's capital.
