Brazil beat Spain 2-0 to win Hereford's IBSA World Blind Football Championship 2010
BRAZIL clinched a deserved 2-0 win over Spain this afternoon to seal the IBSA World Blind Football Championship 2010 in Hereford.
Goals in each half from the outstanding strike duo of Ricardo Alves and Jeferson Goncalves inspired Brazil to the title at the Royal National College for the Blind.
Alves put Brazil ahead in the 20th minute but Spain could have levelled when Antonio Martin had a penalty saved with 12 minutes remaining.
Goncalves doubled Brazil’s lead with a spectacular individual goal before Severino Silva missed a penalty with 96 seconds remaining.
Brazil played some excellent football and were popular champions with the capacity crowd at thePoint4 in Venns Lane.
They have also now qualified for the blind football event at the Paralympic Games in London 2012.
Earlier, England finished fourth in the tournament after losing 1-0 to China in the play-off for third position.
Ledbury’s Lewis Skyers was unfortunate to concede an own goal in the 10th minute.
Ya Feng Wang’s low shot crashed against a post and rolled over the line after striking the diving goalkeeper on the back of the head.
Skyers made several excellent saves while the hard-working England captain Dave Clarke missed a penalty in the early stages of the second half.
England’s most capped player and record goal-scorer, Clarke, collected a silver salver in recognition of their fourth-placed finish from the Mayor of Hereford, Anna Toon.
