Brazil's Rousseff to form new government this week: chief of staff
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff will announce a new governing coalition before the end of the week, her chief of staff Jaques Wagner said on Tuesday, after her main coalition partner left the government.
“The PMDB took a quick decision that opens the opportunity for the President to form a new coalition for her remaining two years and nine months in office,” Wagner told reporters after the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party decided to break away.
