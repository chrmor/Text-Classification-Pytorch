Chemical weapons used in Syria, according to British newspaper sources
The British press has released details of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict.
The Times reported that evidence has been discovered in a soil sample smuggled out of Syria. The newspapers sources refused to have their names revealed but said that “some kind of chemical weapon” has been used in the country. They could not tell whether Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces or the rebels were responsible.
A team of United Nations led experts is on standby in Cyprus waiting for permission to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria. The deployment is at an impasse due to diplomatic problems.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said the mission can only be successful if it considers allegations from all sides.
In other developments, four Italian journalists kidnapped in Syria on April 4 have been freed and are now in Turkey.
