Fifty killed as lorry plunges into DR Congo lake
At least 50 people have been killed after a lorry plunged into Lake Tanganyika in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, officials have said.
The victims were travelling on the lorry to a town in South-Kivu province, near the border with Burundi, with goods they were planning to sell.
A UN-run radio station reported that six people had survived the accident.
Road accidents are common in the DRC because of reckless driving, badly-maintained vehicles and poor roads.
Last month, at least 220 people died when an overturned oil tanker exploded in Sange in South-Kivu.
