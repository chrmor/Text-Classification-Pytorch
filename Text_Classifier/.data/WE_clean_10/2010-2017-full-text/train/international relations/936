Police disperse blocked migrants at France-Italy border
Italian police moved in Saturday to disperse around 200 migrants who were staging a sit-in at a border crossing with France after French police refused to let them enter the country, an AFP reporter said. Italian police in riot gear pushed the migrants back towards the town of Ventimiglia, five kilometers (three miles) from the border. However, a group of around 50 men slipped away from the police cordon and took refuge on rocks near the border post. Most of the migrants eventually complied with the police orders and trudged towards a tunnel leading to Ventimiglia. An Italian police official said the migrants would be taken from there by bus to reception centers in the western province of Imperia. A record number of 1,439 migrants were intercepted this week by French police in the Alpes-Maritimes region of southeast France, with 1,097 returned to Italy.
