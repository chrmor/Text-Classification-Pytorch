Voters oust Flint mayor amid city's water problems
FLINT, Mich. (AP) â€” Voters have ousted the mayor of Flint, Michigan, amid a fallout over the city's drinking water problems.
Newcomer Karen Weaver beat incumbent Dayne Walling in Tuesday's election. Walling led the city amid the public health emergency.
Flint switched from nearby Detroit's system to water from the Flint River last year in a cost-cutting move. Officials recently confirmed elevated blood-lead levels were found in children.
The city reconnected to Detroit in hopes of resolving the emergency as it awaits completion of a pipeline to Lake Huron.
Walling and other officials repeatedly told residents the water was safe but blamed state and federal agencies for the problems. The original switch happened while Flint was under state emergency financial management.
Weaver, a psychologist, focused on water issues during her campaign. She said Flint needs leaders who will "speak out."
