Monster Arizona wildfire threatens line of mountain towns
A massive wildfire burning in Arizona continued to grow Tuesday, aided by dry, windy conditions that fueled the flames and sent dense smoke billowing across several states.
The devastating Wallow Fire remained completely uncontained and grew to almost 500 square miles Tuesday. It is the second-largest wildfire in Arizona history.
A handful of communities have evacuated and authorities were poised to evacuate two more.
"We will be watching the fire's behavior closely today," said Stephen Miller, a spokesman with the Southwest Area Incident Management Team.
Gusts of up to 40 mph and temperatures into the 80s combined with low humidity and a threat of dry lightning, strained efforts by more than 2,300 firefighters to contain the blaze in the Apache and Sitgreaves National Forests.
"Visibility is pretty bad at times," said Dan Muth, vice mayor of Springerville, Ariz., which sits north of the fire and was on "pre-evacuation" alert.
The National Weather service warned again of high heat and strong winds for an area encompassing the so-called Wallow Fire and two more large fires also burning in the state.
Muth said the Wallow Fire was driving wildlife out of the mountains and into the valley in search of food and water, and that one motorist collided with an elk Monday.
"It's not pandemonium, but people are concerned," he said. "It's the sheer magnitude" of the fire.
The U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies battling the blaze say it expanded considerably in recent days, burning near Nutrioso and Alpine in eastern Arizona near New Mexico.
Smoke was visible as far east as Iowa, as well as closer states including New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. It was blamed for hindering views of the Rocky Mountains from downtown Denver.
Evacuation orders were in effect for Alpine and Nutrioso and expanded Monday to include Greer and Sunrise. Luna, N.M., was put on notice to be ready to leave, the Forest Service said. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer declared a state of emergency.
As winds whipped the flames, spot fires were reported as much as 3 miles ahead of the fire's northeastern flank, the Forest Service said. A red flag, signifying extreme fire danger, was issued for the area because of low humidity and high winds.
The Forest Service said the blaze started May 29 near the White Mountain town of Alpine. Authorities say an abandoned campfire may have sparked it. So far, flames have destroyed five buildings. No serious injuries had been reported.
The two other fires scorching the state have combined to burn more than 150,000 additional acres. Both are considered human-caused.
From 1990 to 2010, only eight fires in Arizona exceeded 50,000 acres burned and only three of those burned more than 100,000 acres. In the 2011 fire season, there are already three fires that have burned more than 50,000 acres, two of which have burned more than 100,000 acres.
No significant weather relief is in sight. The forecast is for continued hot, dry, windy conditions across Arizona, New Mexico and much of the southern Plains for the next few days, according to meteorologist Dan LeBlanc of the National Weather Service in Flagstaff, Ariz.
The weather service posted a fire weather watch for today across much of northern and eastern Arizona, which means critical fire conditions are possible because of predicted strong winds and extremely low humidity.
