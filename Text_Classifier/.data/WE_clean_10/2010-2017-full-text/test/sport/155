The International Cricket Council (ICC) has formed a three-man anti-corruption tribunal which in January will hear the case of three Pakistani players allegedly involved in spot-fixing.
Former Test captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer face charges of alleged spot-fixing during the tour of England which ended last month.
The tribunal will be made up of Michael Beloff QC (chairman), together with two other Code of Conduct Commissioners - Justice Albie Sachs from South Africa and Sharad Rao from Kenya - as per the appointment procedure described in the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code.
It was also agreed that the full hearing would be scheduled to take place from January 6-11 next in Doha.
The decision to shift the hearing to Doha was taken as Asif is barred from entering in United Arab Emirates after he was deported in 2008 on possession of banned drugs.
"The three players were charged under article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code on 2 September 2010 and have been provisionally suspended since that date," the release said.
Salman and Aamer had accused the ICC of delaying the verdict on the case last month but the ICC denied the accusation, saying it wanted an urgent solution to the case.
The scandal broke after a report by British tabloid The News of the World prompted Scotland Yard to launch an investigation into allegations of spot-fixing during the Lord's Test against England in August.
Police raided the team's hotel in London and questioned Salman, Aamer, Asif and bowler Wahab Riaz, but they have yet to level any charges.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended the trio and late last month rejected appeals from Salman and Aamer. Asif withdrew his appeal.
Last month Pakistan Cricket Board barred the three players from using practice facilities at the national cricket academy in Lahore before suspending their central contracts.
