Five soldiers dead, 4 missing in Fort Hood swift water
FORT HOOD, Texas (KXAN) -- The bodies of five soldiers were recovered in water downstream from their vehicle on Fort Hood, Thursday. Three were found Thursday afternoon and two more were found Thursday night.
Four other soldiers remain missing. The soldiers were swept downstream when their Light Medium Tactical Vehicle overturned at the Owl Creek Tactical low-water crossing and East Range Road.
The soldiers are from the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, a statement from Fort Hood said.
Three soldiers were rescued from the water earlier near the vehicle and are in stable condition.
They were taking part in routine training activities when they were swept from the road around 11:30 a.m. in the northeast corner of the military installation. The area where the incident happened has been described as a heavily-wooded, hilly area on rugged terrain.
Multiple resources from the Fort Hood Directorate of Emergency Services, local and state agencies were deployed to help in the rescue and recovery of personnel and property, the statement continued.
The fort, the largest active duty armored post in the United States Armed Services, says names of the deceased will not be released until 24 hours after all next of kin have been notified.
Fort Hood is located between Killeen and Copperas Cove, about 60 miles north of Austin. Of Fort Hood's 240,000 acres, 217,000 are designated training area.
"Texas stands ready to provide any assistance to Fort Hood as they deal with this tragedy," Gov. Abbott said. "The brave men and women stationed at Fort Hood and across our country put their lives on the line every day, and be it through rescue operations or on the battlefield, Texas will forever remain grateful for their sacrifices."
