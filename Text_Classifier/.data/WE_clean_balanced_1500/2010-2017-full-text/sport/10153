It wasn't as easy as the final score indicated.
The Warriors got off to a dreadful start offensively, and by the end of the first quarter, the Rockets held a 22-17 lead.
However, Houston's inability to take advantage of Golden State's early struggles came back to bite it.
The Warriors proceeded to drop 35 points in the second period to take a 52-46 lead into halftime. The two teams played evenly in the third quarter, and Golden State took a 74-68 lead into the fourth.
That was when Harrison Barnes took over.

Thanks to Barnes' heroics, the Warriors were able to stretch their lead to 15 midway through the fourth period.
Still, the Rockets continued to battle as they have all postseason, trimming the lead to eight. Golden State also had a scare during the final 12 minutes when Klay Thompson took a knee to the side of the head by Trevor Ariza and was forced to exit the game. Fortunately, he suffered only a right ear laceration.
