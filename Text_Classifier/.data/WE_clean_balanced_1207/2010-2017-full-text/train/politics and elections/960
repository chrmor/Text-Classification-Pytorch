China urges renewed struggle against Dalai Lama
A high-ranking Chinese official is calling for a renewed struggle against the Dalai Lama's influence and for strengthened controls over Tibetan Buddhism.
State media on Friday quoted Jia Qinglin as urging Communist Party officials to step up efforts to promote development and ensure social harmony in Tibet and Tibetan areas of neighbouring provinces.
The comments by Jia, the ruling party's fourth-highest ranking official, come weeks ahead of the third anniversary of the most widespread uprising against Chinese rule among Tibetans in decades.
China blamed followers of the exiled Dalai Lama for fomenting disturbances that included rioting in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, on March 14, 2008, that left 22 people dead.
The Dalai Lama has denied the charge.
