BlueScope to cut 1,000 jobs, shares plunge
BlueScope Steel Ltd will close two of its production facilities and cut 1,000 jobs as part of a restructure aimed at returning it to profitability.
Shares in steel maker plunged almost 10 per cent to their lowest ever after the company reported a more than $1 billion loss.
The company will shut down its number six blast furnace at Port Kembla, in the Illawarra region south of Sydney, and close its Western Port hot strip mill in southern Victoria.
The blast furnace closure will result in 800 job losses, while 200 jobs will be cut at Western Port.
Contractors and suppliers will also be affected by the closures, BlueScope says.
The company has reported a $1.054 billion net loss for the year to June 30, which compares to a $126 million profit in the previous corresponding period.
