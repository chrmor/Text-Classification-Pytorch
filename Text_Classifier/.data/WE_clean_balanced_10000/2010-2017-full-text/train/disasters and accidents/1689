Mexico has 'worst ever' rainy season
Mexico is experiencing its worst rainy season on record, and the rains are set to intensify, President Felipe Calderon said on Thursday, as almost one million people were affected in the latest storms.
"We're facing the most intense rainy season recorded in our beloved Mexico," Calderon said during a visit to northern areas affected by Hurricane Alex, which caused 22 deaths and left some 40,000 homeless in July.
Calderon earlier visited flood-hit eastern areas, some of the worst hit by rains which also pounded the south and centre in the past week, affecting more than 900,000 people and leaving seven dead, according to local officials.
Rain between January and August this year has been almost double the historical average and September will be "one of the rainiest in many years", Calderon said.
Following Alex, Hurricane Frank left four dead and two missing as it travelled up Mexico's Pacific coast in August.
