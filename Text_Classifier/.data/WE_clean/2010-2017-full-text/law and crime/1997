Two due in Dublin court on terror charges
Two men are due in court in the Irish Republic on Sunday afternoon following a major operation against suspected dissident republicans.
In total, ten people have been arrested and questioned by police since Friday.
Seven, including a woman, were arrested in County Wexford, where bomb-making components were found. Another man was detained in County Waterford.
Two others were arrested in Dunleer, County Louth following the discovery of a gun and ammunition.
The men are aged between 19 and 71, while the woman is in her 20s.
The two men are due to appear before a sitting of the Special Criminal Court in Dublin at 1600 BST.
A spokesperson for the Irish police, the Gardai, said they had been arrested under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.
Irish state broadcaster RTE said the arrests are part of an operation led by the country's Special Detective Unit targeting a faction of the Real IRA.
There have been a number of dissident republican bomb attacks in recent weeks.
On Monday, the Real IRA left a bomb close to the Ulster Bank on Londonderry's Culmore Road. The bank and several shops were damaged. No-one was injured in the attack.
In August, a car containing 200lb of explosives went off outside Strand Road police station in the city, causing substantial damage.
