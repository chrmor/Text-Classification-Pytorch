Three NYC buildings to scrub Trump name
He’s fired — or at least his name is.
Three Upper West Side buildings that bear Trump’s name will soon be scrubbed of any trace of the president-elect, according to Equity Residential.
The company said that rental buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Blvd. will no longer be called “Trump Place.” Instead, they’ll be referred to by their street addresses.
“We are removing the [Trump] name on those buildings,” said Equity Residential spokesman Marty McKenna. “The decision was to brand the buildings with a more neutral building identity that will appeal to all current and future residents.”
The changes are already in motion, and everything that has the Trump name on it will be removed from the buildings.
“We took a number of issues under advisement, including input from residents,” McKenna said.
He added that the company had a contractual obligation to use Trump’s name, but that contract recently expired.
Residents at the buildings have pushed for the move for some time, and 600 people signed an online petition asking for the Trump name to be scrubbed.
“Just as celebrities have their endorsements rescinded for bad behavior, Equity Residential should rescind its leasing arrangement with Donald Trump, whose behavior has surely tarnished the Equity Residential brand,” the petition said.
