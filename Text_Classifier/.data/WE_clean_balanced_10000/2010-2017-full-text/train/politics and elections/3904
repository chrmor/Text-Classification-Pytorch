Cuba 'set to release three more political prisoners'
The Cuban government is to release three more political prisoners, the Roman Catholic Church in Havana says.
This would be in addition to the 52 prisoners whom Cuba agreed to release in a deal brokered by the church and the Spanish government in July. Sixteen of that group have yet to be freed.
All three prisoners have agreed to leave Cuba for Spain, the church said.
Human rights groups believe that between 40 and 100 dissidents remain in jail on the island.
Human rights activists hope that the move to free the three men is the first in a big new round of political prisoner releases.
Earlier in the week there were reports that human rights and dissident groups in Cuba had been asked by the Catholic Church to help identify all remaining political prisoners on the island.
The move raised speculation that the government was considering to free all political prisoners.
Of the 52 men included in the July deal, 36 have been released and sent to Spain with their families.
