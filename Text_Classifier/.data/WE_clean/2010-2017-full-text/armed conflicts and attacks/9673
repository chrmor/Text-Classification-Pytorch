World powers demand ceasefire in Syria
World and Arab powers are urging Syria to immediately cease all violence and called for enforcing tighter restrictions and sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
The Friends of Syria conference, held on Friday in Tunisia, demanded Damascus to immediately permit humanitarian agencies to deliver aid goods and services to civilians affected by the bloodshed, but it ruled out any military intervention and preferred a peaceful transfer of power.
The group is modelled on the contact group of countries that supported the rebels who overthrew Muammar Gaddafi's regime last year.
Unlike Libya, however, the prospects of a military intervention in Syria are seen as slim.
"We want a democratic transfer of power in Syria without foreign military interference," Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem said following the meeting.
He said the countries in the meeting vowed support to the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), which they have recognised as "a legitimate representative of Syrians seeking peaceful democratic change," a step below full recognition.
