In his concession speech, he said despite his shortcomings, he always gave it his best."Faith and trust has been placed in me, and I've tried to honor that faith and trust. Whatever shortcomings I have, whatever faults I have, I can guarantee you one has never been a failure to give all I can every day I can for Hawaii," said Gov.

He says he will take some time to reflect on his past 40 years of public service.Ige and Shan Tsutsui will run together in high-profile general election that will feature former lieutenant governor Duke Aiona and Elwin Ahu on the Republican ticket, as well as Mufi Hannemann and Les Chang as Independents.
