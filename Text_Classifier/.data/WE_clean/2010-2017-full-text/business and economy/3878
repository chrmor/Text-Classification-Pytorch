New figures show US banks foreclosed on a record one million American homes in 2010.
Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate for the fourth year in a row, with one in 11 homes affected.
Among the worst-hit states was California which was once at the heart of the housing boom.
Now more than five million homeowners nationwide are at least two months behind in their mortgage payments.
Foreclosures had slowed amid revelations banks had based proceedings on improper documentation but they are expected to surge again this year.
