Popular file-sharing service LimeWire shut down
Popular online file-sharing service LimeWire was shut down by a US federal court today following a lawsuit filed by the music industry.
The move came a little more than five months after a US judge ruled in favor of 13 music companies in a copyright infringement and unfair competition case brought against LimeWire.
LimeWire.com featured a legal notice on its home page today stating it was "under a court-ordered injunction to stop distributing and supporting its file-sharing software".
The legal notice linked to the court order from US District Court Judge Kimba Wood ordering the closure of the service.
LimeWire chief executive George Searle said in a statement he was "disappointed with this turn of events".
