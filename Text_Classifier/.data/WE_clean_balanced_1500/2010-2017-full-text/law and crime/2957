Athens derby abandoned after fires started
The Athens derby between Panathinaikos and Olympiacos was abandoned on Sunday after home fans reportedly set fire to several parts of the stadium.
The Superleague encounter between the two arch-rivals was called off nine minutes before full-time after Panathinaikos fans lit fires around the stadium and threw missiles and flares at police.
Away fans were not in attendance at the Olympic Stadium due to league restrictions.
Initial crowd disturbances delayed the start of the second half by nearly an hour, and the mood in the stadium was not helped when Olympiacos took the lead through Djamel Abdoun's 51st-minute strike.
Referee Anastasio Kakos eventually called a halt to proceedings in the 81st minute after a number of explosions occurred close to the field of play.
''That was not football,'' he said. ''It is one of the worst moments in Greek football.''
