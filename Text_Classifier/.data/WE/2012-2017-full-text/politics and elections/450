US official detained at airport in Pakistan
An employee at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad was detained at the Peshawar airport in Pakistan on Tuesday after bullets were found in his luggage, police said
Authorities found 17 bullets in the luggage, said Shabeeh ul Hassan, a Peshawar police official.
The man was released after it was confirmed that he worked for the embassy, Hassan said.
Last year Raymond Davis, a U.S. official, was arrested in Pakistan in a incident that strained diplomtic relations.
Davis was charged with killing two men in Lahore, Pakistan, last January. He was released months later after compensation was paid to their families.
U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and tried to claim diplomatic immunity but then revealed that he was a CIA contractor.
Davis said he killed the two men in self-defense, though Lahore authorities called the case "clear-cut murder."
