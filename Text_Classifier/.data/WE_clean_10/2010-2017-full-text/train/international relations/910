Alleged Mossad spy granted bail in Germany, 'can return to Israel if he wants' -  Haaretz - Israel News
Prosecutors say an alleged Mossad spy wanted in connection with the slaying of a Hamas leader in Dubai earlier this year has been set free on bail by a German judge on Friday.
Cologne prosecutors' spokesman Rainer Wolf said after a closed-doors hearing that the suspect known as Uri Brodsky is free to travel wherever he wants to go while judicial proceedings against him in Germany will continue.
Wolf said Brodsky could "return to Israel today if he wants to."
Prosecutors accuse Brodsky of illegally helping to procure a German passport used in connection with the Jan. 19 slaying of Hamas commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai, allegedly by a Mossad hit squad.
Brodsky was arrested June 4 at Warsaw airport. He was extradited to Germany on Thursday.
Israel's suspected forgery of European passports allegedly used by members of a hit squad who took part in the killing of the Hamas leader in Dubai in January annoyed several European countries, including Britain, which expelled an Israeli diplomat over the matter in March.
Police in the United Arab Emirates said the elaborate hit squad linked to the Jan. 19 slaying of Mabhouh - one of the founders of Hamas' military wing - involved some 25 suspects, most of them carrying fake passports from European nations and Australia.
Among the faked passports, according to Dubai police, was one issued in 2009 by authorities in Cologne with Brodsky's alleged involvement. The passport was issued to a man named Michael Bodenheimer, who allegedly was part of the hit squad. Â
