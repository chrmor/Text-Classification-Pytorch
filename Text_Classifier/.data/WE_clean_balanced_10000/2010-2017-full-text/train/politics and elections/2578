Sydney set to be disrupted by mass protest
ROAD closures and public transport disruptions are set to plague Sydney today as police, firefighters, teachers and transport workers prepare for the biggest mass demonstration in two decades.
In what's been widely described as "a day of chaos", up to 20,000 workers are expected to gather in central Sydney from 11.30am (AEST) in protest at the public sector wage cap and job cuts.
They'll march from the Domain and St Mary's Cathedral to deliver their message against the measures to the NSW Parliament in Macquarie St.
To make way for the march, roads around The Domain and Parliament House will be closed from 12.30pm to 2.30pm. The closures include parts of Macquarie St, Hunter St, Prince Albert Rd, St James Rd and College St. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area or expect delays.
Sydneysiders can expect disruptions on public transport, with Route 441 bus services terminating and starting at the Queen Victoria Building from midday until 3pm.
The maritime union says some of its members will stop work to join the rally in protest at government plans to privatise Sydney Ferries.
Peak hour ferry services will not be affected but there will be some disruptions between 10am and 2pm.
At schools and TAFE colleges across NSW, about 750,000 students are expected to be affected as up to 67,000 teachers walk off the job in protest at the 2.5 per cent cap on public sector wages.
Their 24-hour strike action defies a ruling by the NSW Industrial Relations Commission yesterday ordering them not to strike.
In addition to the public sector wage cap, the government's plan to cut 5000 back-office jobs in the public service, which was unveiled in Tuesday's Budget, has galvanised union anger.
Unions NSW secretary Mark Lennon says if the expected 20,000 people turn up for the rally and march it will be the biggest mass protest in more than two decades.
These sorts of numbers would dwarf the 10,000 state, Catholic and TAFE teachers who marched on Parliament House in 1988, during the Greiner coalition government's first year in office.
In June, 12,000 unionists marched on State Parliament against Premier Barry O'Farrell's policy of capping public sector wages at 2.5 per cent.
NSW Labor leader John Robertson won't be taking part in the rally, despite being a former secretary of Unions NSW.
"It's not for me to endorse this rally," Mr Robertson said today.
"It's a matter for the unions - they've made a decision that they are going to have a protest, I'll be inside (Parliament House) delivering my budget reply."
His Budget reply speech is due to begin at 10am - 90 minutes before the rally begins behind the house.
