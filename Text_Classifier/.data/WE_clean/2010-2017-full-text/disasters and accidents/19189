Nicaragua mine collapse: 20 miners rescued alive, five still missing
Rescuers in north-eastern Nicaragua have saved 20 miners but five are still missing after a cave-in at an unlicensed gold mine in the village of El Comal, near the town of Bonanza.
The miners had been trapped deep underground for more than 24 hours but 20 were found alive.
"We give thanks to God our Lord and the Virgin Mary for having saved from death 20 artisanal miners," First Lady Rosario Murillo, the Nicaraguan government's official spokeswoman, told reporters.
She said five miners had "not surfaced" and rescue crews were still trying to locate them.
The miners were removed one at a time using a pulley system installed late on Friday near the pit where they had been trapped since early Thursday.
They were mostly younger than 30 and were "pretty tired, exhausted, dehydrated, muddy and dirty," an AFP photographer on the scene said.
The miners were embraced by family members, who had stayed nearby since the accident.
There had been 28 "guiriseros," or informal gold miners, working 800-metres underground in the shaft early Thursday when the mouth of the mine caved in because of a landslide triggered by heavy downpours.
Earlier reports said two of the miners made it out alive on their own by digging through the debris.
Footage broadcast by a local TV station appeared to show the body of one dead miner being recovered.
