Middle East protests: King steps in amid Bahrain unrest
The king of Bahrain has gone on television to announce an investigation into the deaths of two protesters killed in clashes with security forces on Monday.
On Tuesday, a mourner was shot dead at the funeral of a protester killed when police fired a barrage of tear gas and rubber bullets in the capital, Manama.
Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa offered his condolences to the men's families.
But thousands of protesters gathered in Manama's main square soon after.
