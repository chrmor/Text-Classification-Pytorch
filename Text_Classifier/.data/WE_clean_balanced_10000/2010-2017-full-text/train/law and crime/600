The premier of the Cayman Islands has been arrested as part of a corruption investigation, local police say.
The charges against McKeeva Bush, 57, include misuse of a government credit card and importing explosive materials.
Mr Bush has been in power since his United Democratic Party (UDP) won general elections in 2009.
The British overseas territory is one of the world's largest financial centres and a well-known tax haven.

Mr Bush previously held the post of leader of the islands' government between November 2001 and May 2005.
A member of the legislative assembly representing West Bay, he also holds the post of minister of finance, tourism and development.
