American Among Five Foreigners Killed in Attack on Kabul Guesthouse
Gunman stormed a guesthouse in Kabul, Afghanistan, during a party for foreigners on Wednesday, killing five, including an American citizen, officials said.
All three attackers were also killed, and more than 70 guests at the Park Palace Hotel were rescued, a police official said. Five other people were injured, officials said.
A State Department official confirmed the American's death, but would not provide any more details. "Our thoughts are with the families of the victims at this time," the official said.
Amin Habi, a U.S. citizen from Los Angeles, told The Associated Press that a party was going on at the hotel to honor a Canadian when the gunmen stormed the guesthouse.
The hotel has both guest rooms for visitors and a residential area for those who live full time in Kabul, including foreign aid workers, according to the AP.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, though the Taliban have attacked guesthouses before in Kabul, the AP reported.
