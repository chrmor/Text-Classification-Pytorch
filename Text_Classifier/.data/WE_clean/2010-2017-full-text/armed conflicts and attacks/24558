Islamic State vows to destroy Saudi prisons after executions
RIYADH, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Islamic State group pledged to destroy Saudi Arabian prisons holding jihadists after Riyadh's execution of 47 people including 43 convicted al Qaeda militants on Saturday.
An article in an online magazine posted on Tuesday singled out the al-Ha'ir and Tarfiya prisons where many al Qaeda and Islamic State militants have been detained. In July, an Islamic State supporter killed himself in a car bomb at a checkpoint outside Ha'ir prison near Riyadh.
