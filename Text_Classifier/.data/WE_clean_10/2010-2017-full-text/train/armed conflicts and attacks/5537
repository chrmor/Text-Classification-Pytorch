At least 20,000 flee violence in Sudan's Abyei-UN
KHARTOUM, May 24 (Reuters) - At least 20,000 people have fled Sudan’s Abyei region to Agok in the south after the northern army seized the disputed area, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
“We don’t know exact figures... Around 20,000 are in Agok,” said U.N. spokeswoman Hua Jiang, adding that a U.N. team was assessing the situation on the ground.
North Sudanese forces moved into Abyei town in the disputed border region over the weekend. Agok lies in south Sudan, which is due to become an independent state on July 9. (Reporting by Ulf Laessing, Khartoum newsroom)
