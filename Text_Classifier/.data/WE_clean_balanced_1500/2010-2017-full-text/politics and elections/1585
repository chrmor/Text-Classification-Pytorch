Egypt warns of crackdown on unrest
Egypt has warned of harsh measures to quell civil unrest after protesters stormed Israel's embassy, forcing the ambassador to flee and prompting Washington to say it was "deeply concerned".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the mob attack late on Friday in Cairo a "serious incident", but said his country was "committed to preserving peace with Egypt, which is in the interest of Egypt and Israel."
The United States, an ally of both countries, said it was doing all it could to keep ties from deteriorating further.
The embassy attack - which saw staff rescued by commandos - was the worst since Israel established its mission in Egypt after Cairo became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state, back in 1979.
After a meeting with the ruling military council, Information Minister Osama Heikal said Egyptian authorities would take all necessary steps to preserve order, including the protection of embassies.
Calling the unrest an "attack on Egypt's image", Heikal added: "It is clear that the behaviour of certain people menaces the Egyptian state in its entirety." And he warned: "Exceptional circumstances demand decisive judicial measures."
