Kazakh parliament adopts law on snap presidential elections
The Kazakh parliament adopted the law "On Amendments to the Constitution of the Kazakhstan Republic" today, which grants the president the right to declare snap presidential elections. "The law provides a constitutional basis for holding snap elections," Deputy Presidential Administration head Talgat Donakov said.
Donakov said the amendments will snap presidential elections to be held legally. "The draft law provides for empowering the head of state with the constitutional right to appoint a special presidential election, which, according to the project, will be conducted in a manner and within the deadlines established by constitutional law," Donakov said.
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Monday refused to hold a referendum to extend his presidential term until 2020 and offered to hold snap elections this year, thereby reducing his term by two years.
Nazarbayev made the decision after the Constitutional Council ruled the referendum legally incorrect and against the foundations of democracy.
A massive campaign to collect signatures in support of the referendum unfolded in Kazakhstan in recent weeks. The action group collected more than 5 million signatures.
