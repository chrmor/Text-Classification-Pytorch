FestPac welcomed with full day of celebration
For just a little while, the seafaring stories of old came to life: sails in the distance, growing larger and getting closer. They were coming to visit just as the traditional seafarers said they would; just as they have done for millennia.
Several hundred people — thousands, perhaps — stood in awe as a dozen hand-crafted vessels slowly made their way to shore. The traditional navigators (those who voyage without modern instruments) were greeted by a cheering, grateful audience that stood five people deep, lining the Hagåtña shore from the boat basin all the way to the last rock near the channel.
Though the Festival of Pacific Arts hadn’t yet had their opening ceremonies — scheduled for 10 hours later — the dawn arrival of the seafarers brought the festival to life.
After Sunday evening’s kickoff ceremony at the Paseo, FestPac 2016 goes full-bore for the next two weeks and comes to a close on June 4.
The throng of islanders stood in eager anticipation as the Guam canoes landed first, representing Guam’s various seafaring groups: TASI, TASA, Fa’ulosna, Ulitao and even Chelu Sakman from San Diego.
They welcomed visitors from Chuuk, Yap and Palau and as the last of the voyagers finally stood on solid ground, the crowd couldn’t wait — they erupted in unabashed cheers. Many smiles were also punctuated with tears of personal joy and island pride.
“Uno hit,” said Joseph Leon Guerrero, in Chamorro. The Inarajan resident made a sweeping gesture to the huge crowd that stuck around to watch various contingents sing, or dance for songs, random dances.
“Uno hit,” he repeated. “To actually see the visitors arrive, to walk amid this crowd that includes all our other island neighbors; even to watch them perform … there’s always some word, or dance, or song that sounds familiar. Because ‘uno hit.’ We are one.”
The arrival ceremony hit 29-year-old Satleen Lokopwe on so many levels, she could barely contain herself. She has roots from Chuuk and Yap, she said, and she felt her heart beating faster as her fellow countrymen appeared on the water. She danced and chanted with a local cultural group as part of the ceremony, but she was astonished to see her older brother arrive on one of the Chuuk vessels.
“I’m so proud of him. I was so excited to see him, I hadn’t seen him in more than four years,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting to see him at all.”
Ratu Epeli, a traditional dancer from Fiji, was busy getting his picture taken along with members of his fellow dance troupe. They were a popular attraction in their bright blue outfits, and people from various islands stood in line for a chance to take pictures with them.
“I’ve been here since the 18th and … I feel like I’m at home,” said Epili, beaming a toothy smile. “I’m looking forward to meeting other people, sharing culture with them and just enjoying this festival.”
Lea Torres, 17, of Umatac also took a turn getting a picture with the Fijian dancers. They were good-looking, she said, and was looking forward to meeting dancers from other island nations.
“Everyone here has really nice eyebrows,” she said, laughing along with her friend Courtney Villagomez, another Guam dancer who hails from San Diego as part of the Diaspora — Guam representatives who live abroad.
“It’s my first time to Guam in a long time, so I’m looking forward to learning a little more about my culture and especially my language,” said the 14-year-old. “I was a little intimidated at first to meet so many people but I’m making lots of friends. Like Lea!”
Lorenzo Reyes, 23, steered the Ulitao, one of his group’s three vessels, to shore. His muscular physique accented his traditional wear of a loincloth and not much else.
“Today was like taking me back to the old times. To see the ocean littered with sails as it was during the time of our ancestors … It was beautiful,” he said. “It’s overwhelming too, with all these cultures coming together. I would like to see some of the dancing, and I’m excited to see the other cultures. I want to share mine too.”
Sunday evening the Paseo Stadium filled to capacity as thousands gathered to witness the official opening ceremony of the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts.
The Guam flag was dropped down by parachute by Maj. Tim Ohno with loud cheers from the crowd. The parade of Nations saw each group present their cultural dance and chants for the opening. Each nation also gave a gift to Gov. Eddie Calvo representative of their culture.
Attendees continually cheered on the cultural exchange as each nation made their way to the front of the main stage.
The celebration will continue on through June 4.
