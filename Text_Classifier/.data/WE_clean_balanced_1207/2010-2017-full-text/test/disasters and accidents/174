Masai Mara: Four killed in plane crash
Two Kenyan pilots and two German tourists have been killed in a plane crash in Kenya's Masai Mara national park, Kenyan police said.
The aircraft was carrying 11 passengers, including five Germans, four Americans and two Czechs, the AFP news agency said.
Three other passengers were seriously injured, police said.
Propeller planes are often used to take tourists to the Masai Mara, one of Africa's most popular attractions.
A team from the Flying Doctors Service had been sent to the site and three critically injured passengers had been flown to the capital Nairobi, the AFP news agency said.
An official said the plane had crashed soon after taking off from the Ngerede airstrip close to midday.
The plane was a light aircraft owned by Mombasa Air Safari, according to Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper.
