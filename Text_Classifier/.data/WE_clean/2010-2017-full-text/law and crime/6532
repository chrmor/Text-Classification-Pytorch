Taiwan registered vessel fined for dumping pollutants off coast of Nfld.
ST. JOHN’S, N.L.—A Taiwan-registered vessel has been fined $80,000 for dumping pollutants in the ocean off the south coast of Newfoundland.
A lawyer for the MV HSIN entered a guilty plea on behalf of the owners of the vessel to a federal charge of discharging pollutants in the ocean.
Judge David Orr went along with a joint submission for the fine, which included an order to pay $20,000 to the court and $60,000 to Environment Canada’s damage fund.
The vessel was leaving Canada and heading to Dunkirk in January 2009 when two spills happened — oily bilge water was discharged when the engine room was being cleaned.
On Jan. 30, 2009 a Transport Canada satellite detected 220 litres of the substance in the ocean.
The following day there was a spill between the amounts of 400 and 2,118 litres.
