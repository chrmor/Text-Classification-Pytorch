Chilean president appoints new cabinet
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet has appointed a new cabinet as she seeks to overcome a fall in popularity and a series of political scandals.
Jorge Burgos, the current defence minister, has been made interior minister, replacing Rodrigo Penailillo.
It is the first time a Chilean finance minister has been replaced mid-term since the return of democracy in 1990.
Ms Bachelet also changed the ministers of justice, labour, culture and social development and appointed a new presidential spokesman.
"This new, inspiring and demanding phase requires renewed energies and new faces," she said in a statement at the presidential palace.
Ms Bachelet asked all her ministers to resign as a poll last week put her approval rating at 29% - the lowest for her current administration as well as for her previous presidency between 2006 and 2010.
Correspondents say Ms Bachelet's popularity has been hit a series of political scandals, a slowing economy and disillusion with her campaign of reforms.
Trust in Chile's politicians and the business elite was eroded by a campaign-financing scandal involving right-wing politicians and a prominent financial company.
Also, Ms Bachelet's son resigned in February as head of a government charity over allegations of influence-peddling.
Although Chile's national bank regulator cleared Sebastian Davalos of any wrongdoing, the issue became a scandal.
Economists welcomed the appointment of Mr Valdes, who is currently chairman of state bank Banco del Estado and a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund.
His predecessor, Mr Arenas, had a strained relationship with the business community following unpopular reforms.
