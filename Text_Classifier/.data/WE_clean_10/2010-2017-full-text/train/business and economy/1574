Delta fuel costs may rise by $1 billion in 2011
NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- At today's fuel prices, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -0.90% could see its annual fuel costs rise by $1 billion in 2011, said Chief Financial Officer Hank Halter, in a Tuesday memo to employees. "As we move into 2011, the biggest issue we face is the recent steep run-up in fuel prices," Halter said. "Recent fare increases, combined with revenue growth from our ancillary products and services, will provide a more long-term, revenue-based solution to addressing the high fuel environment." Delta expects its average fuel price in 2011 to rise by 5.3% to $2.60 a gallon from $2.47 a gallon last year, including taxes and hedges. Delta shares fell nearly 2% premarket to $12.50.
