Ex-mayor of Colombia's capital jailed 18 years for graft
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) â€” The former leftist mayor of Colombia's capital was sentenced on Tuesday to 18 years in jail for taking bribes in the awarding of ambulance contracts
Former Bogota Mayor Samuel Moreno was removed from office in 2011 and then jailed on corruption charges.
The grandson of a popular mid-century president, Moreno was found guilty this month of benefiting from almost $2 million in kickbacks paid by ambulance companies hired by the city. He still faces charges of even larger graft tied to the awarding of infrastructure projects that were left unfinished.
In reading the sentence Tuesday, a judge who previously accused Moreno of "looting" the city's coffers also banned the politician from holding public office ever again.
Moreno denies any wrongdoing and has said that if necessary he will appeal his conviction to an international tribunal.
