Protestors throw eggs and cheese at Harney
Protestors have thrown eggs and cheese at a car carrying the Health Minister Mary Harney in Co Tipperary.
It is understood the incident happened this afternoon as she was arriving at the Mid Western Regional Hospital in Nenagh to open a new unit.
It comes after red paint was thrown at the minister during an event in Dublin two weeks ago.
