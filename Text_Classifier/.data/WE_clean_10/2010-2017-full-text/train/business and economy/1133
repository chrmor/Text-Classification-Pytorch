Skip Yowell, JanSport Co-Founder Who Blazed Trail for Backpacks, Dies at 69
Skip Yowell, a passionate outdoorsman who helped found JanSport, a leading producer of backpacks, died on Wednesday in St. Peter, Kan. He was 69.
His sister, Diana Crouch, confirmed his death and said that he had battled lung cancer.
Fueled by a 1960s back-to-nature craze and a love of the outdoors, Mr. Yowell and a cousin, Murray Pletz, started JanSport in 1967 in a spare room above a Seattle office belonging to Mr. Yowell’s uncle. The company was named after Mr. Pletz’s girlfriend, who became his wife.
“His whole life was outdoors and introducing it to generations of people. That was so important to him,” Ms. Crouch said.
Mr. Yowell never lost his passion for nature, but when America’s love of camping cooled in the 1980s, companies making outdoor goods had to adapt.
