Romania's prime minister says to scrap graft decree on Sunday
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania’s government will scrap a decree decriminalizing some graft offences on Sunday, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu said on Saturday, as some 140,000 demonstrators protested against the law a stone’s throw from his office.
“We’ll hold an extraordinary meeting on Sunday to repeal the decree, withdrawn, cancel it ... you understand, and find a legal way to make sure it does not take effect,” Grindeanu said in televised speech from the cabinet’s headquarters.
