Sea Shepherd finds key whaling ship
After a marathon pursuit, Sea Shepherd says it has found and shut down Japan's key whaling factory ship, Nisshin Maru, deep inside Australian Antarctic waters.
The conservation group's long range ship Bob Barker located the Nisshin Maru late last night about 60 nautical miles offshore at Commonwealth Bay, due south of Tasmania.
Two harpoon ships accompanying the Nisshin Maru were said to have been in pursuit of whales when the Bob Barker arrived, but immediately halted their work when the Nisshin Maru steamed away.
"We have kept them running for two months and that has disrupted their operations considerably," the ship's captain, Peter Hammarstedt, said.
