Some South African miners freed; others won't leave for fear of arrest
More miners were freed Monday after being trapped for two days in an illegal gold mine in South Africa, authorities said.
After some miners surfaced, authorities said a total of 24 had been freed, according to rescuers from ER24 emergency medical service. The miners said they were trapped on Saturday, and the rescue effort began on Sunday.
But a handful of others still underground were refusing to come out because they feared being arrested, the rescuers said.
One miner was trying to persuade the approximately sixminers who were still underground to come up, ER24 said.
The mine is an abandoned gold mine in Benoni, just outside Johannesburg.
Those who have surfaced were taken to a medical station and checked for injuries, and once they cleared, were taken into custody by local police, ER24 said.
Initially ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said that a rockslide trapped the miners. But Govan Whittles, a reporter for South Africa Eyewitness News at the scene, said the miners told rescuers that a rival group dropped boulders down the shaft to trap them.
Gold-rich South Africa has repeatedly warned its citizens against trying to dig into old mines. Illegal mining "poses a danger not only to the miners themselves, but to the communities, as well as the economy and existing mines," Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu said in September.
South Africa's Parliament has discussed legalizing the illegal mines to allow the miners to earn a living, but the cost of bringing the mines up to modern safety codes could be prohibitive.
