2 Palestinians Killed in West Bank Clashes
JERUSALEM — Two Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli security forces during clashes in the West Bank on Friday, according to the Palestinian news media.
The two Palestinians, killed in separate episodes, were identified as Tamer Faraj Sammur, 22, from Tulkarm, and Adi Nafez Jabar, 19, from the Ramallah area.
Hamas had called for a “day of rage” on Friday in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza. An Israeli military spokeswoman, speaking on the condition of anonymity under army rules, said that more than 1,000 Palestinians participated in a violent protest in Tulkarm, hurling rocks and firebombs at troops and a nearby industrial center, and that a similar clash took place in Safa, near Ramallah.
After “exhausting” other means to disperse the protesters, she said, Israeli troops fired live bullets toward the main instigators. Last Friday eight Palestinians were killed during clashes with Israeli forces.
