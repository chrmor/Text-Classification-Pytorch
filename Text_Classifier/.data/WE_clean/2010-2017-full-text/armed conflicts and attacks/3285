A student suffered bleeding to the brain when he was struck by a police truncheon during the tuition fees protest, his mother has alleged.
Alfie Meadows, 20, of Middlesex University, was hit on the head as he tried to leave the area of Westminster Abbey, his mother Susan Matthews said.
Alfie underwent a three-hour operation and is now recovering in hospital.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has begun an independent investigation after it was informed by the Met Police about the allegation.
