Azeri security forces kill four men suspected of terror plot
BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s security forces killed four members of a group that had been planning to carry out terror acts in the country, the state security service said on Wednesday.
Ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, a majority Muslim country with a population of about 10 million, is a major energy producer in the Caspian Sea region.
The group, which was eliminated during a special operation, was “loyal to a number of terrorist organizations operating in foreign countries and had been planning to carry out terrorist acts in Azerbaijan,” the security service said in a statement.
