Le Mans 24 Hours 2015 Porsche wins, one-two result
Hulkenberg was one of the three drivers in the No. 19 car, which finished ahead of No. 17 Porsche, featuring former F1 driver Mark Webber and Audi’s No. 7 car.
Audi had won seven of the past eight races, with Porsche’s last win coming in 1998.
Returning to Le Mans after a 16-year absence in the top category, Porsche missed out last year because of a mechanical problem as Marcel Fassler, Andre Lotterer, and Benoit Treluye drove Audi to its fifth straight title.
This time, Porsche overcame an early crash in a dominant win.
