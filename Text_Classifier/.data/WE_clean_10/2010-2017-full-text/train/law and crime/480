Daughter 'devastated' after rapist father released on bail
The daughter of a 72-year-old man has said that she is "devastated" after he was released on bail today, despite pleading guilty to raping her for several years.
Patrick O'Brien from Old Court Avenue, Bray, Co Wicklow pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to 16 charges of the rape and indecent assault of Fiona Doyle at Mackintosh Park, Pottery Road, Dun Laoghaire from 1973 to 1982.
O'Brien raped his daughter so often it became for her "as frequent as having dinner", the trial heard.
He received a 12-year sentence, with nine years suspended.
Mr Justice Paul Carney branded these "heinous crimes", and said it was one of the worst cases of abuse of a daughter one can possibly find.
However he gave consideration to the serious ill health of the accused and suspended most of the sentence.
He said that it was a case fit for an appeal and that such a hearing should be expedited, releasing O'Brien on bail.
Ms Doyle, who has waived her right to anonymity, spoke out after the sentence hearing.
"Devastated," she said. "Just totally devastated.
"I don't know what [message] this gives out to the world or to Ireland, but he raped me for 10 years, and he walks out of here today.
"I just feel that the system has done it to me too."
