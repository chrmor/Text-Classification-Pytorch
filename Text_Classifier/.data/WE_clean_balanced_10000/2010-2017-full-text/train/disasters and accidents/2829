Italy says 3,700 boat migrants rescued, operations ongoing
ROME, May 3 (Reuters) - Nearly 3,700 migrants were rescued from boats near the coast of Libya on Saturday and early Sunday and more rescue operations were expected during the day as people smugglers took advantage of calm seas, Italy's coast guard said.
All of those rescued were being brought back to Italian shores, a spokesman for the coast guard said, and some reached Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost island, during the night.
The nationalities of those rescued had not yet been determined, he said.
