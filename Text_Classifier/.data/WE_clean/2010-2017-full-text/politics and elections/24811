Italy Same-Sex Union Opponents Hold 'Family Day' Protest in Rome
Italy is the only Western European nation that doesn’t recognize same-sex civil unions or gay marriage, in part because of the heavy influence of the Catholic Church on government and public opinion.
Pope Francis last week warned that “there can be no confusion between the family willed by God and any other type of union.”
Many of those opposed to the change fear the law is a Trojan horse that would lead to full legalization of gay marriage. Some fear it could also open the way to loosening laws on surrogate motherhood, which is illegal in Italy.
Saturday's protest was billed by supporters as a "Family Day" in the name of traditional marriage. It has been backed by Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, president of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, The Tablet reported.
Upwards of an estimated half-million people filled Rome's Circus Maximus venue, although organizers said as many as 2 million supporters attended the rally. That number could not immediately be verified by NBC News.
Rally-goers opposing the same-sex unions bill were adamant about their positions.
"We are against this law because children are not a given right," said Stefano Mariani. "Since the beginning of time, children have come from a mother, and a father."
"Two men can’t give birth to life, so you can’t call that a family. It’s selfish of them to want children just to satisfy their desires," added Pamela Burattini.
But last weekend, hundreds of thousands of supporters of the bill flooded more than 100 cities with rainbow flags.
A smaller group of supporters gathered in front of Senate in Rome on Thursday while the bill was being debated. Many held ringing alarm clocks, chanting: “Wake up Italy.”
