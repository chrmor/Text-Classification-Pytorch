Carrie Lam Wins Vote to Become Hong Kong’s Next Leader
“When the No. 2 official becomes the No. 1, there isn’t going to be much change,” said Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of those protests. “ ‘One country, two systems’ is going down the drain, and our high degree of autonomy will exist in name only,” he said.
The protests in 2014 were a response to Beijing’s plan to let Hong Kong choose the chief executive this year by direct popular vote. Under that plan, China would have screened the candidates — a restriction that made the so-called reform a sham, in the view of the student-led protesters who occupied the streets for months.
The local legislature rejected the proposal, meaning that a small committee again chose the city’s leader this year. But pro-democracy politicians have said they have no regrets, arguing that the plan would have bolstered Beijing’s grip on Hong Kong by giving the chief executive a false public mandate.
Since the Umbrella Movement protests, young people in particular have become even more resentful of the Chinese government, calling in growing numbers for Hong Kong’s self-determination and even independence from China. In the first major legislative elections after the protests, voters turned out in record numbers and elected for the first time two young, openly pro-independence politicians.
But in November, Beijing took the extraordinary step of intervening in a Hong Kong court case to prevent them from taking their seats, after they pledged allegiance to the “Hong Kong nation” during their swearing-in ceremony and inserted an anti-China snub into their oaths of office.
Fears of increasing interference from Beijing were also worsened when a bookseller and, later, a billionaire businessman disappeared from Hong Kong, later to re-emerge in police custody in mainland China. Such developments have alarmed many residents, but others are loyal to China and regard pro-democracy activists as a disruptive force.
