U.S. Orders Family Members to Leave Consulate in Istanbul
The U.S. Consulate in Istanbul remains open. The order does not apply to other U.S. diplomatic posts in the country.
Turkey has been on edge since a failed coup carried out by a faction of the armed forces on July 15. The terror group ISIS has also carried out attacks in Istanbul and other parts of the country. ISIS is suspected of carrying out the deadly suicide attack on Istanbul's airport in June.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed the coup on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania and has requested that the U.S. extradite him on unrelated issues. Gulen has denied having any rolein the attempted coup. The U.S. has not announced a decision in the matter.
