Mexican marines free 104 kidnapped migrants
MEXICO CITY (AP) â€” Authorities say Mexican marines have freed 104 kidnapped Central American migrants who were being held in a house in the border city of Nuevo Leon.
A statement from the Secretary of the Marines says the 102 Hondurans and two Salvadorans, including 13 women, had been held captive for four days.
It said the rescue operation came after authorities received a tip that vehicles were seen arriving at the house in Tamaulipas state and armed men were then seen violently unloading people from them.
The statement didn't say if the migrants were trying to cross Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States, but it is common for Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. to be kidnapped and ransoms demanded from their families.
