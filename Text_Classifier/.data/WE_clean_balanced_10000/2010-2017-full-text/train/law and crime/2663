Inmate gets one more day to pick fatal drug
A federal judge gave condemned murderer Albert Greenwood Brown another day to decide whether to be put to death with a single drug rather than the standard three-drug combination, but refused a renewed request late Saturday to examine the procedures for California's first scheduled execution in nearly five years.
U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel of San Jose, who had halted executions in the state in 2006, denied Brown's request for a stay on Friday and gave him a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline to choose the method of lethal injection - a heavy dose of a sedative or the sequence of three chemicals used in California and most other states.
After one of Brown's lawyers described a visit to his befuddled client at San Quentin State Prison on Saturday, Fogel extended the deadline to noon today. But he denied defense lawyers' request to reopen the question of whether the state's revised and untested injection methods contain safeguards that were absent from the procedures he rejected in 2006.
Brown is "a simple man with obvious neuropsychological deficits," attorney John Grele said in a court filing. He said Brown was unprepared to discuss his options and apparently had not thought about them in any detail.
Grele said he was unable to give Brown much information because state officials have provided few details of how they would conduct a one-drug execution.
Brown, 56, was convicted of raping and strangling 15-year-old Susan Jordan, who disappeared while walking to school in Riverside in 1980.
He had been convicted of raping another teenager in 1977.
