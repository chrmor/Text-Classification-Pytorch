The hurricane is expected to pass The Bahamas tomorrow, bringing tropical-storm-force winds, storm surges, coastal flooding, and 5-10 inches of rain. While the European forecast model suggests Joaquin will avoid the U.S. East Coast, the American model predicts it will ram into Virginia, Maryland, or North Carolina this weekend. (NBC News), (NHC)
