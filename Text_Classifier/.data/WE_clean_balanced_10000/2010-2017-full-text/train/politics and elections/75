What President Obama Will Focus on in His Democratic National Convention Speech
President Obama has been working on his speech for the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night for the past few weeks, including late into Monday night, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said at today’s White House briefing.
Wednesday also marks 12 years since Obama was introduced on the national stage in Boston, which he will reflect on, Schultz said.
“I think he will talk about what the country has accomplished together since then. What the grit, ingenuity and determination of the American people have achieved over the last eight years,” Schultz said. “Whether that's coming back from the brink of economic collapse to the longest stretch of private-sector job growth in the nation’s history, or whether that's changing the way the world views the United States for the better.”
“As you've heard from him over the past few weeks, the president has been candid on why he thinks electing the Republican nominee is a risky path for the United States. But I would suggest to you that I think tomorrow night’s speech will much more focus on how Secretary Clinton has the judgment the toughness and the intellect to succeed in the Oval Office,” he added.
Schultz said the president will also focus on a stark difference between the two candidates' messaging -- better united versus divided.
On topping First Lady Michelle Obama’s speech on Monday, Schultz acknowledged “she set the bar very high.”
“The president is aware of the importance of the speech. Obviously the national conventions come around once every four years. They are a high-profile moment. And the president believes, as he’s said, the stakes are high in this campaign,” Schultz said.
