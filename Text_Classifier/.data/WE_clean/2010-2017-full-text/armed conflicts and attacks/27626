10 civilians killed by roadside bombs
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) â€” An Afghan official says at least 10 people have been killed in two explosions in the eastern province of Paktia.
Naqib Ahmad Atal, spokesman for the provincial governor, says five members of one family died when their vehicle struck a hidden roadside bomb. He says another five people were killed when their tractor hit a similar devise an hour later on Friday afternoon.
Atal blamed Talban fighters who are active in the area and regularly seed the roads with bombs. The Taliban use such terrorizing tactics to intimidate local residents.
The United Nations says the Taliban are responsible for the vast majority of civilians killed and wounded in the war. The world body has said that 1,601 died in the first half of 2016.
