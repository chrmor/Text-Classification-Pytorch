Afghanistan to unblock Youtube
() is set to lift a block placed on Youtube more than two months ago over a controversial anti-Islamic video, a communication ministry official said on Wednesday.
The decision to lift the block, which takes effect on Saturday, came in response to a request by the Ministry of Information and Culture, said Emal Marjan, director of the Information Technology Department of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.
The Ministry of Communication has asked all Internet Service Providers in Afghanistan to unblock the site on Saturday, Marjan told Pajhwok Afghan News.
The government blocked Youtube and Google in September amid concern the US-made video, “Innocence of Muslims,” would spark violent protests in the country.
The block on Google, which owns Youtube, was later lifted but the popular video sharing website has remained shut.
