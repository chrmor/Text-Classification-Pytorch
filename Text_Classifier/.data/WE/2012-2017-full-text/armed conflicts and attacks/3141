Bahrain takes legal action against opposition over march
MANAMA - Bahraini authorities are taking legal action against the opposition Al Wefaq group for organizing a banned anti-government march in which six protesters were arrested, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday. It was not immediately clear what the action might entail, but the government has threatened to ban the group in the past and its statement comes despite calls from Washington for Bahraini leaders to pursue a meaningful dialogue with the opposition. Bahrain, where the US Fifth Fleet is based, has been in political turmoil since a protest movement dominated by majority Shi'ite Muslims erupted in February last year.
