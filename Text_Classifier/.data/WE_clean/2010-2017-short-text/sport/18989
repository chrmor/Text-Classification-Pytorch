In American football, Adrian Peterson, running back for the Minnesota Vikings, turns himself in to authorities in the Houston area. The day before, he had been indicted on child abuse charges stemming from an incident in which he spanked his 4-year-old son with a tree branch that he used as a switch. The Vikings have deactivated him from Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. (ESPN)
