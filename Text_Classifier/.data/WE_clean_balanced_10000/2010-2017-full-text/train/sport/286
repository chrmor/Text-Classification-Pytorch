Stoke's Robert Huth being tested for 'suspected meningitis'
Stoke revealed on Tuesday evening that defender Robert Huth "has suspected meningitis".
Huth, 27, went to hospital after reporting for training suffering from a mystery virus on Monday. The club later confirmed via its Twitter account that Huth is being tested for viral meningitis.
"The club can confirm that Robert Huth has suspected meningitis and that they are awaiting the outcome of further tests," the Stoke statement read.
Earlier, Stoke boss Tony Pulis expressed his fears for the Germany international after the club's pre-season draw at Torquay on Monday.
"It's a major concern so close to the start of the new season because Huthy is such an important figure for us," Pulis told the club's official website.
"It takes a lot to knock Huthy back, but he was clearly not well, so we have sent him to hospital and will hopefully have the results of the tests on him tomorrow. We're just hoping he will be okay and it's not too serious."
