Michael Schumacher apologises to Rubens Barrichello for dangerous move
Michael Schumacher has acknowledged that his controversial impeding manoeuvre against Rubens Barrichello at the Hungarian grand prix yesterday was too hard and has apologised to the Brazilian.
Schumacher said on his websitethat after reviewing the incident he agrees with the stewards that the move was too hard. The seven-time champion says he had no intention of endangering the Williams driver and that he was "sorry" if Barrichello had that feeling.
"Right after the race I was still in the heat of the action," he said. "But after watching the moment again, I must say the stewards were right in their assessment: the manoeuvre against Rubens was too dangerous. I wanted to make it hard for him to pass me but I didn't want to endanger him with my manoeuvre. If he has this feeling I am sorry, this was not my intention.
Barrichello described the move as "a go-kart manoeuvre", saying "it was the most dangerous manoeuvre against me I have ever known". Schumacher was penalised 10 places on the grid for the next Formula One race.
Earlier, Ross Brawn, the team principal at Mercedes, defended Schumacher, claiming the punishment was "pretty tough", and suggesting that Barrichello, as a former team-mate of Schumacher, perhaps had an axe to grind.
"I don't think for a moment Michael was trying to put Rubens in the wall," said Brawn. "He was trying to discourage him from coming down the inside as he thought that was where he would be vulnerable. So he moved across to the inside to try and encourage Rubens to go around the outside.
"At the end of the day he gave him enough space. You can argue it was marginal, but it was tough racing. F1 is a tough business and these things happen in a fraction of a second."
Asked whether the history between them had a bearing, Brawn added: "Certainly not from Michael's perspective. Michael didn't comment on that. I know Rubens has commented on the history between them, but Michael hasn't at all. It is obviously something that is paramount in Rubens' mind."
Brawn has vowed to take all reasonable steps to prevent a repeat of the other controversial incident in the race, when Nico Rosberg lost his right rear tyre as he emerged back on to the pit lane following a stop for fresh rubber. The runaway tyre then rolled and bounced through the pit crews from other teams, knocking unconscious one of Williams's mechanics, Nigel Hope. With three wheels on his car, Rosberg trundled his way to the end of the pit lane and had to retire for the first time this season.
Brawn said: "It appears as the guy came off with the wheel gun it spat the wheel nut, but he didn't see it disappear. The guns are so quick and powerful now you don't see the nut travelling at the speed of light. So when he went back on and fired the gun he realised the nut was no longer there.
"He then went to grab the other gun, but the rear-jack guy thought he had finished, so dropped the car and away Nico went. We will clearly look at how we can prevent it happening again."
