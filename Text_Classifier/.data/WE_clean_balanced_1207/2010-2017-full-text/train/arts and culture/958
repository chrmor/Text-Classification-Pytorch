Pope conducts mass in Croatia
ZAGREB, Croatia, June 5 (UPI) -- Pope Benedict XVI said a mass for an estimated 300,000 people at a Zagreb racetrack on the last day of his visit to Croatia, officials said.
Tanjug reported Sunday the pope would have lunch with bishops before holding an evening mass at St. Stephen's Cathedral.
"We have recently celebrated the Ascension of the Lord and we prepare ourselves to receive the great gift of the Holy Spirit," the pope said in his address, the text of which was released by Vatican Radio.
"Your daily labor for the faith formation of future generations, as well as for marriage preparation and for the accompaniment of families, is the fundamental path for regenerating the church anew and for giving life to the social fabric of the nation. May you remain dedicated to this important pastoral commitment," Benedict said.
Some 25,000 young people attended a mass Saturday evening at Ban Jelacic Square in downtown Zagreb.
