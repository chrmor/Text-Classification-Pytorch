Gunmen storm hotel in Mogadishu; 15 killed, police say
Gunmen stormed a hotel in the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Saturday after detonating a car filled with explosives at the hotel gate -- an attack that has left at least 15 people dead and 25 others injured, police said.
Following the car explosion, someone blew themselves up inside the Naso Hablod hotel as gunmen stormed the building, Somali police Capt. Aden Dahir said. Police responded and engaged in a gunbattle with the suspects for several hours, Dahir said.
The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack on its main broadcaster, Radio Andalus.
Most of those killed and injured were civilians who were passersby and customers of nearby shops and a gas station, police said.
The hotel is frequented by Somali government officials, lawmakers and security officers, Dahir said.
