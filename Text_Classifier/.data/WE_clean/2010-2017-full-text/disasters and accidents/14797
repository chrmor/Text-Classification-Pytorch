PELLA, Wis. (AP) -- A relative of some of the six victims killed in a Kentucky interstate crash says the Wisconsin couple who died was dedicated to raising foster children.
Barbara and James Gollnow, their daughter, two foster children and family friend died March 2 when their SUV was struck by a semi near Glendale, Ky.
Pat Pelkey checked for mail at the Gollnow's house in Pella, a small town in Shawano County. Pelkey says her sister and James were adamant that their foster children have a great life.
