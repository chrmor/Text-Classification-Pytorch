After five days of relentless protests in Tamil Nadu demanding that the ban on Jallikattu be lifted, an ordinance was cleared by the state government on Saturday, satisfying the demand of the protestors, and paving the way to hold the event on Sunday morning. Protestors in some places, however, amended their demand, now seeking what they believed would be a more permanent solution, and prevented Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam from inaugurating Madurai's iconic Alanganallur Jallikattu on Sunday morning.
Here are the latest updates:
Hiphop Tamizha, a pop figure who helped make the Jallikattu protest popular, distances himself from the protest. The popular music director in a Facebook live video on his page said that the protest has been hijacked by anti-social and anti-national elements. The demands have digressed to communal, anti-national, abusive slogans. He will address a press meet this evening in Chennai along with Dr P Rajasekaran of Jallikattu Peravai, Karthikeya Sivasenapathy of Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation, and Rajesh of Veeravilayattu Association.
