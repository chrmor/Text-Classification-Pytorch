Maoist rebels kill 15 police in ambush in central India
NEW DELHIâ€”Maoist rebels ambushed a patrol team in central India on Tuesday, killing at least 15 paramilitary policemen, a police official said.
The policemen were travelling through a densely forested area of Maharashtra state when the rebels set off a land mine, blowing up their vehicle, the official said.
Another 13 policemen were wounded in the powerful blast, he said.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting for more than three decades in several Indian states, demanding land and jobs for agricultural labourers and the poor. They frequently target police and government officials, whom they accuse of colluding with landlords and rich farmers to exploit the poor.
