Egypt kills African migrant trying to sneak into Israel -  Haaretz - Israel News
Egyptian security forces on Sunday shot and killed an African migrant trying to infiltrate the Israeli border from the Sinai Peninsula, news agencies reported.
Officers on patrol opened fire on the infiltrator after he refused orders to stop, hitting him twice in the stomach.
Egyptian police often shoot at African migrants attempting to cross the border illegally, and have killed some 30 attempted infiltrators.
Last week, Egyptian human rights organization criticized the government's response to reports that Bedouin in the Sinai desert had been holding hundreds of African migrants.
Every year thousands of people attempt to cross the border from Egypt into Israel, most often from African countries.
In November, the number of migrants coming from Egypt increased to a record high of 700 per week, according to Israel's Population and Immigration Authority. More than 10,000 people have illegally entered Israel so far this year.
Israel began construction last month on a 240-kilometer barrier along its south-western border with Egypt, mostly aimed at preventing the influx of illegal migrants.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the phenomenon a danger to Israel's Jewish character. Â
