Former Armenian Presidential Candidate Goes On Hunger Strike
Defeated Armenian presidential candidate Raffi Hovannisian has gone on a hunger strike to protest of the outcome of last month's election. Hovannisian, addressing hundreds of supporters in central Liberty Square in the heart of Yerevan, called for President Serzh Sarkisian to step down and accused him of winning last monthâ€™s vote by fraud. According to official results, Sarkisian won with more than 58 percent of the vote, while Hovannisian placed second with nearly 37 percent. Hovannisian's camp has alleged a range of electoral violations. He has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, which was scheduled to consider his complaint on March 11. Armenia's Central Election Commission said last month there were no legal violations during the vote that could have influenced the outcome. Since the election, the opposition has held several peaceful rallies to protest against alleged vote-rigging.
