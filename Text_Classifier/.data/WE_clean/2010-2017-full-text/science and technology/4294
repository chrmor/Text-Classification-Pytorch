Shinmoedake is one of 18 young, small stratovolcanoes that make up what is known as the Kirishima volcano group which straddles the boundary between the Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures. This 1421 m tall Japanese volcano, famous for its feature in James Bond film ‘You Only Live Twice’, erupted on Wednesday 27 June, 2018, at 15h34 local time, sending a plume of ash and gas 2200 m into the air. A similar event occurred on Friday 22 June, 2018, when at 9h09 local time an explosion spewed ash and smoke up to 2,600 meters in the air. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reports that large cinders were flung up to 1,100 meters from the center of the crater rim, flying in a ballistic path, and that resulting ash plume was blown east, carrying small cinders a long way by the wind.
