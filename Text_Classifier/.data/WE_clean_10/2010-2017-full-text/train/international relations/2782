Opposition Groups in Moldova Unite to Protest New Government
BUCHAREST, Romania — Frustration with the political establishment is boiling over again in Moldova, where more than 15,000 people took to the streets of the capital on Sunday to vent their anger at the new government that was sworn in just last week.
Opposition groups from both the pro-European and pro-Russian sides of the country’s political divide united in the frigid weather to shout antigovernment slogans and demand new elections. The protests in the capital, Chisinau, were the latest to rack Moldova, an impoverished former Soviet republic between Ukraine and Romania, since November 2014, when an immense bank fraud with political implications came to light.
The trigger for the latest wave of protests was the appointment of Pavel Filip as prime minister late Wednesday night, leading the country’s third government in less than a year.
The deeply divided Parliament had been wrangling for months over how to replace Valeriu Strelet, who lost a vote of no confidence and was forced to resign as prime minister in October after three months in office.
