Three constables arrested for �arms smuggling�
Uttar Pradesh Police special task force (STF) has arrested three police constables from Hamirpur for their alleged involvement in smuggling arms and ammunition.
Police arrested constable Satya Prakash Tiwari, who was posted in Kanpur Dehat district reserve police line as armourer; constable Jahan Singh, who was posted in Hamirpur district reserve police line as armourer, and constable Brijendra Singh, who was dismissed in 2005 but was reinstated in 2011 after a court order, also posted in Hamirpur.
STF Deputy Superintendent of Police Alok Singh said the constables were arrested on Saturday from near a petrol station opposite the office of Hamirpur Superintendent of Police. He said the STF had laid a trap by contacting the constables as buyers of the illegal firearms and later arrested them when they came to supply the same.
Police recovered two carbines, one rifle, a Maruti car, a motorcycle and more than five hundred cartridges from the constables. They told police that the cost of the two carbines was fixed at Rs 6 lakh, while 180 cartridges of 9 mm were to be sold at Rs 50,000, police claimed.
Singh said they were still examining if the recovered firearms were stolen from the police department's armouries as they have not yet come to know their source.
According to police, Brijendra had been booked in two cases earlier too � one of rape lodged at Mahila police station of Hamirpur and the other for criminal breach of trust lodged at Sumerpur police station. The cases are currently under investigation, they added.
