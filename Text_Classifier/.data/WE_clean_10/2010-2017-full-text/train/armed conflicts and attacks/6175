At least 105 people killed in Syria's Homs-rights group
BEIRUT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - More than 100 people have been killed in shelling by Syrian armed forces of the city of Homs, and hundreds more have been wounded, the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said on Friday, citing witnesses.
“At least 105 people were killed in a massacre in the Khalidya district of Homs, including women and children,” said Rami Abdulrahman, head of the British-based rights group. He said the shelling was continuing.
It is not possible to verify activist or state media reports as Syria restricts access for independent media. (Reporting by Mariam Karouny; Editing by Jon Boyle)
