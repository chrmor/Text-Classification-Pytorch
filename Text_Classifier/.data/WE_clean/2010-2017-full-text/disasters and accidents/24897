Taiwan quake death toll could top 100
The death toll in Taiwan’s earthquake could reach more than 100, a mayor warned, as rescuers said an 8-year-old girl was among four survivors pulled alive Monday from the ruble of an apartment building.
At least 38 people were killed in the southern coastal city of Tainan when the magnitude-6.4 quake struck on Saturday. It happened just before the Lunar New Year, one of China’s most important holidays. At least 170 people have been rescued.
The focus of the accident is a collapsed 17-story apartment building called Wei-guan Golden Dragon. Taiwan’s interior minister said an investigation would examine whether the developer had cut corners in constructing the building.
"There are more fatalities than those pulled out (alive), and the number of fatalities will probably exceed 100," Tainan’s Mayor William Lai said Monday during a visit to a funeral home, according to Reuters.
Taiwanese media named the rescued young girl  as Lin Su-Chin, and said two more survivors could still be in the building. More than 100 people remain missing.
