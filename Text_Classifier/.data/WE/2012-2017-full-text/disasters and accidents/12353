Bangladesh factory collapse kills at least seven workers, dozens feared trapped
At least seven workers have been killed and dozens more are feared trapped after the roof of a half-built cement factory collapsed in southern Bangladesh.
More than 90 staff were on the site in the port town of Mongla when the structure started to cave in on Thursday afternoon, trapping scores under a rubble of newly mixed concrete and steel, police and rescuers said.
Soldiers and emergency personnel used two massive cranes and steel cutters to clear some debris, rescuing about a dozen people, government administrator chief Shah Alam Sarder told AFP.
"The death toll is seven and the number of injured is 53, including at least six whose conditions are critical," he added.
There were conflicting reports of the number of workers trapped, with one saying 100 workers were feared stuck under the debris.
"There were about 150 people, including workers, inside the factory building when it collapsed," said Belayet Hossain, the officer in charge of the Mongla Port police station near the factory.
Soldiers and sailors were helping firemen to search for survivors, another official said.
"There are more bodies inside the debris. We're trying to recover the living people first," district administration official Mohammad Abdus Samad said.
Buildings frequently collapse in Bangladesh, owing largely to widespread use of shoddy building materials and a failure to abide by proper engineering and construction rules.
In April 2013 a nine-storey garment factory complex collapsed just outside the capital Dhaka leaving at least 1,138 people dead.
The collapse of Rana Plaza, built on swampy ground outside the capital, Dhaka, ranked among the world's worst industrial accidents and sparked a global outcry for improved safety in the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments.
