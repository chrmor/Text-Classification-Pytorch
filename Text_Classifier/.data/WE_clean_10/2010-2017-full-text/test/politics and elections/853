Tunisia's Salem Labyedh resigns after Brahmi's murder
Tunisia's Education Minister Salem Labyedh has resigned following last week's assassination of opposition MP Mohamed Brahmi, the prime minister's office has said.
The secular politician's decision came amid growing pressure from opposition groups on the Islamist-led government to step down.
He is the first minister to quit the fractious coalition since the killing.
Tunisia is the birthplace of the Arab Spring, but it has been in turmoil since the overthrow of long-serving ruler President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.
The resignation is further evidence of the increasing pressure on Tunisia's Islamist-led government. The culture and interior ministers have also championed calls for the resignation of the incumbent government and the formation of a national unity cabinet to defuse the worst political crisis facing post-revolutionary Tunisia. Tensions on the streets of the capital have been running high. A central square outside the Constituent Assembly has turned into an open sit-in for both supporters and opponents of the government. Barbed wire separates the anti-government protesters from the pro-government camp. Not since the uprising that toppled longstanding President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has Tunisia faced a political crisis so serious.
The BBC's Sihem Hassaini in Tunis says the resignation of Mr Labyedh is a major blow to the government, led by the Islamist Ennahda party.
Mr Labyedh, an independent, joined the government in March following the assassination of another leftwing politician Chokri Belaid.
It would not be surprising if more ministers quit, as the government comes under pressure to create a new unity government, our reporter in Tunis adds.
On Tuesday, Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou raised the possibility of resigning following the killing of at least eight soldiers by suspected al-Qaeda-linked militants near the Algerian border.
A junior secular party in the coalition, Ettakatol, has also warned it will withdraw from the Constituent Assembly (CA) if a new unity government is not formed.
The CA is weeks away from drafting a new constitution that will be put to a referendum.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh said the government would fulfil its mandate and hold elections in December.
A roadside bomb exploded on Wednesday south of Tunis as a police patrol passed, but no injuries or damage were reported, Reuters news agency reports.
"We are facing two choices. Either we confront terrorism together, or we will distract the army and security forces with political battles that are much less dangerous than terrorism," said Noureddine Bhiri, the prime minister's spokesman.
