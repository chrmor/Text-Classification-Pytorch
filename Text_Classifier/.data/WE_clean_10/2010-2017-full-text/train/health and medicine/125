Cholera deaths in South Sudan rise, thousands at risk: UN
At least 29 people have died in a cholera outbreak in war-torn South Sudan with thousands more at risk of infection, the United Nations said Friday. A total of 484 cholera cases, including 29 deaths -- six of them children under five -- had been reported by the end of June, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Over 140,000 people have sought shelter in U.N. camps across the country during 18 months of civil war. All the cholera cases reported have been in Juba, although tests are being conducted on six suspected cases in areas outside the city.
