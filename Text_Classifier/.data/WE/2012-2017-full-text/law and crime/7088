3 alleged kidnappers killed in Davao shootout
MANILA -- Three suspected members of a kidnap-for-ransom group were killed in a shootout with police authorities in Davao City Thursday afternoon. Two of the fatalities died on the spot while the other died at the hospital. Police said the shootout occurred at a bank in Claveria where the kidnap victim, who was accompanied by her abductors, was supposed to withdraw the P15 million ransom at around 12:30 p.m. Policemen in civilian clothing were about to arrest the suspects when they were suddenly fired upon by the abductors, resulting in a firefight. No one from the police force was hurt. Meanwhile, one of the 14 alleged abductors was arrested. High-powered firearms were also recovered from a vehicle left by the kidnapping group. The victim, who was abducted in Quezon City last July 5, was rescued and is now safe. No ransom was paid. Manhunt operations against the 10 other suspects who escaped on board two vehicles are still ongoing. Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte has issued a shoot-to-kill order against the suspects. -- Reports from May May Benedicto, dzMM; Hernel Tocmo, ABS-CBN News Davao
