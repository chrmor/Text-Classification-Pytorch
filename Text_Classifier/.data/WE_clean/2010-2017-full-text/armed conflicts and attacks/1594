Italian pedophile victims seek support
Italian victims of pedophile priests want such sexual abuse declared a crime against humanity, and have launched an international appeal.
The organiser of the first public gathering of such victims in Italy on Saturday, Salvatore Domolo, a former victim and an ex-priest, said the group is looking abroad for solidarity because justice for pedophile victims is hard to come by in Italy with a statue of limitations of 10 years.
"Here there is no hope. By the time a victim arrives at the awareness of having been a victim, legal intervention is not possible," Domolo said in a country that has long been reluctant to confront the Vatican in its own backyard.
"The complicity of the hierarchy, together with the enormity of the numbers and vast geography of these crimes, should lead us to consider that we are facing a crime against humanity carried out by a political-religious organisation," Domolo told a news conference before the victims met.
"With this gathering, we want to ask civilian justice to do its duty in full freedom and truth, without being intimidated by the clerical culture."
In all, several dozen victims and family members came to the Verona gathering, which organisers hope will help isolated victims to know they are not alone and persuade an Italian public reluctant to believe priests and nuns could have committed such crimes.
