Honda recalls 384,000 US vehicles
Honda is recalling more than 384,000 vehicles in the US because of problems with the ignition interlock mechanism.
The recall involves about 197,000 Accord and 117,000 Civic models from the 2003 model year, as well as 69,000 Element vehicles from 2003 and 2004.
The fault could allow the ignition key to be removed without the vehicle being shifted into "Park" and could cause a car to roll away, Honda said.
Honda said it had received several complaints about the failure of the ignition interlock mechanism.
It said it was aware of "a small number of incidents, including one that resulted in a minor injury".
Honda said customers would be notified from late September.
This is the third recall Honda has issued over the same problem. The previous two were in 2003 and 2005.
