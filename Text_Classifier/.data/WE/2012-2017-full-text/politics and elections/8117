Maldives to inaugurate new president after Mohamed Nasheed's shock run-off defeat
Abdulla Yameen will be sworn in as the Maldives new president today after his surprise win over former leader Mohamed Nasheed in the election run-off.
Mr Yameen secured 51.3 percent of the popular vote compared to 48.6 percent for Mr Nasheed in Saturday's poll.
Despite the acrimonious campaign, Mr Nasheed conceded defeat and said he would not challenge the results of an election monitored by international observers.
"I graciously accept defeat," Mr Nasheed told reporters in the capital Male in a late night address.
"We lost by a very small margin. Democracy is a process. It is up to us to make it work."
He added: "The MDP (Mr Nasheed's Maldives Democratic Party) has always asked for a government elected by the people. Today is a happy day for the Maldives. We now have an elected government."
The election commission said an inauguration ceremony would take place on Sunday and a special session of parliament had also been organised.
Mr Yameen is the half-brother of former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the archipelago for 30 years.
Mr Nasheed won a first vote on September 7 with 45 per cent, but the result was scrapped by the Supreme Court which upheld a complaint about voter list irregularities.
After another attempt to hold the poll was blocked, a re-run of the first round took place on November 9.
Mr Nasheed won by a larger margin of nearly 47 per cent, but still not enough for an outright victory.
A run-off election announced for the day after by the independent Election Commission was again cancelled by the Supreme Court, which is dominated by judges named during Mr Gayoom's three-decade rule.
