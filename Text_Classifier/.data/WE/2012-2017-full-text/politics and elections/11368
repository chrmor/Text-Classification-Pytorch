Pro-government Sunnis dominate Bahrain vote
Pro-government Sunni candidates including Islamists have won the most seats in parliamentary elections in Bahrain boycotted by the main opposition Shiite majority, officials said on Sunday. Results from Saturday's second and final round of voting showed 27 of the parliament's 40 seats won by Sunnis, with the remaining 13 taken by Shiites including three women. The main Shiite opposition Al-Wefaq group -- which withdrew its 18 lawmakers from parliament in protest in 2011 -- denounced the vote as a "farce" and called for a boycott. It claimed the boycott was a success, saying that only 30 percent of voters had cast their ballots, despite the electoral commission putting turnout at 52.6 percent.
