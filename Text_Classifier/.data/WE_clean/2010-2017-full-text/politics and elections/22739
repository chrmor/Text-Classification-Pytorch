Alexis Tsipras had allegedly a phone talk with the ANEL party leader while discussing a possible coalition and future of the country.
ATHENS (Sputnik) — Head of the Syriza party, leading in the Greek snap elections, Alexis Tsipras, discussed a possible coalition with Panos Kammenos, the conservative Independent Greeks (ANEL) party president in a phone conversation, the Athens News Agency reported.
The previous Syriza government created a coalition with ANEL after the January snap elections. The scenario could repeat, if ANEL passes the 3-percent threshold in the elections.

"We continue our negotiations on forming a coalition government," Kammenos said, according to the media.
