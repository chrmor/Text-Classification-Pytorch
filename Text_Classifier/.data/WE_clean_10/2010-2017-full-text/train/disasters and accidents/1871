Seven children die in China fire
A fire at a private shelter for orphans and abandoned children in central China has killed at least seven youngsters and left an unknown number of others injured.
The official website China.org.cn said today the fire broke out at the shelter that was being run from a womanâ€™s home in Lankao county of Henan province. The website cites police at the site as saying that many children had been hurt in the fire, though the specific number was not yet available. The woman who owned the home, Yuan Lihai, had for years been a street vendor in Lankao when she became locally known for sheltering abandoned children, the website said. Another report said she had taken in more than 100 children over the past 20 years.
