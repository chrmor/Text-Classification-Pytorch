Bomb hits Iraqi minister's convoy
At least one person has been killed in the Iraqi capital in a roadside bombing targeting a deputy minister in Iraq's government, Iraqi officials say.
Iraqi security officials said the bomb struck a convoy transporting Fouad Al-Moussawi, a deputy minister of science and technology, in the neighbourhood of Jadriyah, in Baghdad on Monday.
The minister escaped unharmed, but one of his bodyguards was killed in the attack. At least four other bodyguards were injured in the blast as well as three civilians.
Elsewhere in Baghdad, an employee of a telephone exchange was killed and another person wounded in a bombing near the al-Alwiyah communications centre in Karrada, the AFP news agency reported.
Baghdad has been hit by a wave of recent attacks against security personnel and government workers. 
Meanwhile, in Diyala province, north of the capital, three people were killed in a bomb attack on Monday in the ethnically mixed town of Jalawlah.
