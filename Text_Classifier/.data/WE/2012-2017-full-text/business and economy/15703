Photos: Boeing rolls out new 737 MAX 8 airplane
Boeing Tuesday debuted for employees the first fully assembled new 737 MAX 8 airplane, named the "Spirit of Renton."
The new plane was rolled out in a teal paint scheme and celebrated by thousands of employees, Boeing said in a news release.
The latest in the 737 line, the MAX 8 will have 20 percent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation 737s and the lowest operating costs, Boeing said.
"With the rollout of the new 737 MAX – the first new airplane of Boeing's second century – our team is upholding an incredible legacy while taking the 737 to the next level of performance," said Keith Leverkuhn, vice president and general manager, 737 MAX, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the release.
Boeing will ready the plane for test flights in early 2016 and plans to deliver the first planes to Southwest Airlines in the third quarter of 2017.
The 737 MAX 8 is just the first of several new single-aisle planes that will begin production soon, Boeing said. Boeing already has nearly 3,000 orders for planes in the 737 MAX group.
