Flood deaths climb in Thailand
BANGKOK, Oct. 27 (UPI) -- The death toll from October floods in 18 Thai provinces has climbed to 59, Thailand's Emergency Medical Institute said Wednesday.
Lopburi had the greatest number of deaths with 10 followed by Nakhon Ratchasima with nine and Nakhon Sawan with eight, Thai media conglomerate MCOT reported.
The Emergency Medical Institute said 46 of the flood victims were male and 13 were female.
So far, there have been no flood deaths in the capital of Bangkok where flood prevention dikes are due to be completed by 2012.
Officials said flooding continues in central provinces along the Chao Phraya River.
Homes, temples, schools and government offices are under water in the provincial seat of Ang Thong after the Chao Phraya spilled over sandbags.
Those living in Uthai Thani were evacuated when officials determined the flood situation there to be critical.
Floodwaters have begun to recede in the northeastern province of Ubon Ratchathani after reaching a peak Tuesday.
