2015 Super Bowl: Patriots QB Tom Brady named MVP
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has been named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLIX. 
Brady completed 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions in leading the Patriots to a 28-24 win over the Seattle Seahawks. The 37 completions set a Super Bowl record.
• The end of the Super Bowl had everyone flipping out
Brady is now a three-time Super Bowl MVP, also collecting the honor in 2001 and 2003. With Sunday's win, he joined Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw as the only quarterbacks to win four Super Bowls. Brady is 4-2 overall in the Super Bowl in his career.
The Patriots won the game after Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was intercepted at the goal line with less than 25 seconds remaining. New England took the lead late in the fourth quarter after Brady threw a three-yard touchdown to Julian Edelman.
Following Seattle's 43-8 win over the Broncos last season in Super Bowl XLVIII, linebacker Malcolm Smith was named MVP. You can see all previous Super Bowl MVPs here.
