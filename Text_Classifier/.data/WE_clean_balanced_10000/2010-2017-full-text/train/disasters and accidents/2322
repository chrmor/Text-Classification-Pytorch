Russian pilgrims killed in bus crash in Ukraine
At least 14 Russian pilgrims have been killed in a bus crash in north-eastern Ukraine, officials say.
The bus, with more than 40 people on board, came off the Kiev-Chernihiv motorway and rolled over at about 0530 local time (0230 GMT), Ukraine's emergencies ministry said.
The pilgrims were reportedly travelling from the Pskov region in Russia to the Pochaiv monastery in western Ukraine. A police investigation is now under way.
Russia's emergencies ministry later said it was sending a plane to evacuate the injured.
