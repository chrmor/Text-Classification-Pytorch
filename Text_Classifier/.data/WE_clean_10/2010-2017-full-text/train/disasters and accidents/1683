Pakistan mine gas explosion 'kills 52'
Inspector says there is '0% chance' of survivors after blast in Sorange mine, Baluchistan province
Rescuers used shovels and bare hands to dig out miners buried after a gas explosion in a coal mine in south-western Pakistan. Fifty-two were feared dead but only 27 bodies have been recovered since the explosion on Sunday.
"We have yet to dig out and search the remaining two wings, but there is 0% chance we can get anybody alive," said Iftikhar Ahmed, a government mine inspector.
Ahmed said the mine, owned by the state-run Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, was declared dangerous two weeks ago because of methane gas, but the warning was ignored by the contractor.
