Barnes & Noble fires CEO, labeling him 'not a good fit'
The board of book store chain Barnes & Noble announced Tuesday that it has ousted CEO Ronald D. Boire, saying he “was not a good fit for the organization."
Boire, who had been on the job less than a year, will be replaced by Executive Chairman Leonard Riggio, the company announced. Riggio formerly served as Barnes & Noble CEO and had planned to stay until Sept. 14, but he has now postponed retirement until a permanent successor can be found. The company said the search for a replacement will begin immediately.
Barnes and Noble's board didn't give a more specific reason for Boire's departure, adding only that "it was in the best interests of all parties for him to leave the company.”
Boire became CEO of Barnes & Noble last year, replacing Michael Huseby, and had vowed to expand the book retailer’s electronics product marketing. Boire’s prior experience included CEO of Sears Canada and senior roles at Brookstone, Best Buy, and Sony Electronics.
In the company's most recent quarter, Barnes & Noble reported that it lost $30.6 million, compared to $19.4 million for the same period a year ago. It came on sales of $876.6 million, down from $910 million a year ago. Boire said at the time, "We believe our marketing, merchandising and membership initiatives will lead to increased traffic and conversion in our stores."
Barnes & Noble has 640 stores across the country, and been seeking for ways to better compete against online seller Amazon by expanding into a wider variety of music, art supplies and toys in addition to books and stationary.
