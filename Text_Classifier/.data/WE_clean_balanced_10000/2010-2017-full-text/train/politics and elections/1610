Romney Wins Maine Caucuses
Mitt Romney averted embarrassment Saturday when he was declared the winner of a presidential straw poll in Maine’s nonbinding caucuses.
He won 39 percent of the vote, barely edging out Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the only other Republican candidate to campaign actively in the state. Mr. Paul drew 36 percent.
Mr. Romney’s victory came hours after he won a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, an annual meeting of conservative activists.
Although the vote in Maine had no substantive meaning in terms of delegates, losing it could have created a political headache for Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and extended a negative storyline that had been building since last week when he lost Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri to Rick Santorum. Those losses suddenly increased the symbolic importance of Maine’s all-but-ignored caucuses, and an additional loss Saturday in his own backyard would have magnified concerns that he could not seal the deal with voters.
Mr. Romney scraped by Mr. Paul by just 194 votes. But the total number cast was less than 6,000 — about 2 percent of registered Republicans in the state.
Mr. Paul was unbowed, and gave no indication that he would drop out.
“We’re not going away,” he told his supporters at an event in Portland, Me.
