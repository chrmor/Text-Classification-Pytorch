Uefa demands evidence in Euro 2012 corruption claim
European football's governing body, Uefa, has called for proof in response to allegations of corruption in the bidding race for Euro 2012.
Former Cyprus football official, Spyros Marangos, has claimed that money changed hands before Ukraine and Poland were awarded the championship.
Uefa says the claims are unsubstantiated but will be investigated if evidence is provided.
It has given Mr Marangos two days to provide "tangible elements of proof".
Lawyers for Mr Marangos, a former treasurer of the Cyprus Football Association, told the BBC that he had tried for the past two years to draw Uefa's attention to the allegations for which he had witnesses.
They said that Mr Marangos had been due to meet the head of Uefa's disciplinary committee in August, but the meeting had been cancelled by Uefa four days beforehand.
The allegations come at an unfortunate moment for Uefa, as world football's governing body, Fifa, is investigating allegations of vote selling in the race to host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022.
In a statement, Uefa said it took the fight against corruption very seriously and threatened to start legal proceedings if evidence was not submitted by 27 October at the latest.
Mr Marangos' lawyers said he wanted the truth to come out and would decide how to respond.
