Authorities in the Czech Republic have outlawed hard liquor sales after at least 23 deaths from bootleg alcohol poisoning. But the ban is stirring the ire of bar and restaurant owners in the tourism-dependent country and raising fears it will only drive more drinkers to buy suspect spirits on the black market.
The action announced Friday on sales of beverages with 20% or higher alcohol content has swept more than 20 million bottles of alcohol off store shelves in the Eastern European state renowned for its beer but also a major producer and consumer of stronger drinks.
On Wednesday, President Vaclav Klaus called the ban "an unreasonable and exaggerated solution" to the rash of poisonings and likened it to Prohibition, according to the Ceske Noviny  website. During a visit to Italy, Klaus in part blamed the poisoning crisis on what he called "absurdly high taxes" imposed by the government and said the known deaths and dozens of nonfatal cases of methanol poisoning demonstrated "a fundamental failure of the state" to ensure safe spirits production.
A nationwide search for the source of the toxic spirits has led to the seizure of large barrels of alcohol with methanol content over 30%, as well as 94,000 government stamps from an unlicensed bottling plant that had been issued for an authorized producer, Deputy Interior Minister Jaroslav Hruska told a news conference in Prague on Wednesday, Ceske Noviny reported.
The tainted drink that was the source of some of the poisoning deaths was sold under counterfeit labels of legitimate Czech distillers, Hruska said.
