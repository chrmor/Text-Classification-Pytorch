BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's meteorological authority on Sunday downgraded the alert for Typhoon Chan-Hom from red to orange as it is set to weaken on its way to move northeast.
As of 5:00 a.m. Sunday, Chan-Hom was located at the northern area of the east China sea, packing winds of up to 35 meters per second, according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC).
The center forecast the typhoon to move northeast at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour to reach the Yellow sea. Its forces will gradually weaken along the way.
From Sunday to Monday, the provinces of Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang will be hit by rainstorms, while strong gales of up to level 13 is forecast in the Yellow sea, prompting the NMC to issue a blue rainstorm alert.
China has a four-tier color-coded weather warning system, with red representing the most severe weather, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
Chan-Hom, the ninth typhoon this year, made landfall on Saturday afternoon in east China's Zhejiang province, affecting more than 710,000 people and 81,460 hectares of farmland, according to the provincial flood control and drought prevention headquarters.
So far, no casualties have been reported.
