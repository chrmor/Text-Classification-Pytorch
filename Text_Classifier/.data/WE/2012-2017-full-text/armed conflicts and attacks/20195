Assam: Army convoy ambushed in Assam, 3 soldiers killed
DIBRUGARH/GUWAHATI: In one of the biggest attacks on security forces in Assam in two decades, three Army jawans were killed and four seriously injured when suspected Ulfa (Independent) and NSCN(K) militants ambushed their convoy after triggering an IED blast in Pengeri area in Tinsukia district on Saturday. The convoy of 15 Kumaon Regiment was returning from Pengeri to Digboi at 5.30am after a counter-insurgency operation when the militants struck. The blast sent the 2.5-tonne truck flying in the air before it landed several metres away. The militants then began firing at the security personnel using automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. A gypsy transporting six soldiers bore the brunt of the firing as it stood exposed in the middle of the road. While Havildar Multan Singh was killed on the spot, Havildar Rishipal Singh and Naik Narpat Singh died on the way to Dinjan Army Hospital in Tinsukia. Four other jawans -- Manoj Singh, Virendra Singh, Bikram Chand and Satyendra Pratap Singh -- who were injured, were first taken to Assam Oil Division Hospital in Digboi and then airlifted to the military hospital. "In three decades of counter-insurgency operations, we had almost reined in Ulfa-I. The recent incidents are temporary setbacks," said Assam DGP Mukesh Sahay. Home minister Rajnath Singh spoke to CM Sarbananda Sonowal . Singh said the ministry was monitoring the situation. Sonowal told reporters that the attackers would get a befitting reply. Army spokesperson Lt Col Suneet Newton said the Army has launched a massive combing operation to nab the militants. " We believe no less than 15 ultras were involved," Tinsukia SP Mugdhajyoti Mahanta said. Four rocket-propelled grenade shells, IED splinters and countless empty AK-47 cartridges were found at the ambush site.
