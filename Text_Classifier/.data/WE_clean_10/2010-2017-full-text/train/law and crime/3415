Two Chinese consulate staff killed at Philippine restaurant shooting
Two Chinese consulate staff were killed in a shooting at a Philippine restaurant that also injured the consul general of the country’s second biggest city, local reports said, adding that a Chinese couple have been arrested.
The shooting happened at the Lighthouse restaurant in the central city of Cebu at lunchtime on Wednesday after waiters heard an argument among nine Chinese who were celebrating a birthday party, reports said.
“A clip of the restaurant’s CCTV footage shows the shooter in a striped blue shirt approach the female victim, Hui Li, from behind and firing,” the Cebu Daily News website said.
“Another fatality, Sun Shan, deputy consul, was shot in the neck,” the report added, citing police.
The Chinese envoy to Cebu, Song Ronghua, was injured in the shooting, but there were conflicting reports on his condition, with some saying he was shot in the neck and was stable, while others said he was in a more serious condition.
Various reports named the gunman as Chinese national Li Qingliang. His wife Gou Jing was also held by police, according to reports.
Li was said to be aged 60 and his wife 57. The Philippine Star newspaper said they were “employees of the Chinese consulate office”.
Online reports showed pictures of one of the victims being rushed away from the scene on a stretcher, while others showed police searching for evidence at the restaurant, which was said to be upmarket and popular with local politicians.
Lighthouse manager Stephen John Patero told the AFP news agency that staff did not see the shooting because the guests were in a private room.
But he said waiters had heard them shouting at each other.
“They are all friends who apparently figured in an argument,” he said.
Restaurant cashier Remedios Rivalde told the news agency: “They ordered a lot of food, but no liquor.”
