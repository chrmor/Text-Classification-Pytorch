Kenny, who turned 65 this week, will be presenting his first 'Late Late Show' since 2009. The late Gerry Ryan hosted the show in 2008 following the passing of Kenny's mother Connie.
Former consultant psychiatrist Dr Patrick Tubridy (76) passed away peacefully yesterday in St Vincent's Private Hospital after a short illness. RTE released a statement expressing its "sincere sympathies" to Ryan Tubridy and his family on their loss. The funeral will be held on Friday.
It also issued a message from the broadcaster himself expressing his "sincere thanks" for the support and messages the family had received, and requesting privacy. "Ryan was extremely close to his dad and very upset losing him," said a friend of the broadcaster. Dr Tubridy was born in Galway in 1936, and had seven children from two marriages. The eminent Blackrock-based psychiatrist worked for 30 years as a medical director at St John of God's Treatment Centre before his retirement in 2001.
Ryan Tubridy was absent from his morning radio programme yesterday. His agent Noel Kelly said he had been in contact with the Tubridy family to offer his "deepest sympathies, and said he was "saddened to hear the news of Dr Tubridy's passing".
"It is a really difficult time for the family and Ryan is really thankful for all of the support he has been receiving" said Mr Kelly.
Dr Patrick Tubridy's removal will take place tomorrow to St John the Baptist Church, Blackrock, arriving at 9.50am for the 10am funeral Mass followed by a private cremation.
