95 defendants pack into court for one of Spain's biggest corruption trials
The scandal, which broke in March 2006, centres on the alleged payment of millions of euros in bribes to city officials in the mid-1990s by property developers in return for planning permission.
Among the 95 defendants are former mayors of the nearby Spanish resort town of Marbella on the Costa del Sol, Julian Munoz and Marisol Yague, and the ex-chief of urban planning Juan Antonio Roca, suspected to have been the mastermind behind the operations.
If convicted, they face sentences of up to 30 years for corruption, money-laundering and misuse of public funds.
Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government dissolved the Marbella town council in April 2006 in the wake of the scandal and appointed an auditors' commission to take over administration of the tourism hot spot until local elections in 2007.
Others on trial include town councillors, lawyers and building contractors. The trial is expected to last a year.
