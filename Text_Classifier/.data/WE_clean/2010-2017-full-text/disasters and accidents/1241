Heavy rainfall across Victoria has caused landslides, flash flooding and the evacuation of homes.
The central and western areas bore the bront of the heavy rain earlier today, with flash flooding in Ballarat, Maryborough and Bendigo.
Now the state's north-east is bracing for potential floods, with more than 140 millimetres of rain already recorded at Mount Buffalo.
Keith O'Brien from the SES says crews are keeping a close watch on towns in Victoria's north-east and may need to evacuate 100 homes in Euroa.
"During the night, with the peak of the flood there, there's about 100 houses that certainly their properties will be inundated," he said.
"There's a risk of floor level inundation and we will be advising them shortly once we've managed to track the actual houses on our projection that they may need to consider evacuating before dark."
SES spokesman Tim Wiebusch says rivers are starting to rise in the north-east and wind gusts of up to 110 kilometres are expected today.
"The north-east is still continuing to see that rainfall and so we've got alerts out now for communities on the Seven and Castles Creek which runs into Euroa and Violet Town," he said.
"We also have warnings out for communities on the Broken River running into Benalla and also the Ovens and King River catchments."
The weather bureau's Peter Blake says the peak of the rainfall in Victoria's north-east is expected tonight and people should be prepared for potential floods.
"The timing of the flooding is I suppose the key thing, rain is falling now and has been falling for hours," he said.
Emergency crews evacuated homes in and around Ballarat earlier today.
Downpours in the state also triggered landslides, with one blocking the road to Falls Creek.
Another landslide forced the closure of the Mount Hotham Ski Resort after a ticket office was destroyed and left a staff member with minor injuries.
