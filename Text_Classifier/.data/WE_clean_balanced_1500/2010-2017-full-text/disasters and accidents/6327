Seven dead in Bangladesh ferry sinking
At least seven people have died and about 150 people are missing after a ferry sank in Bangladesh.
Officials said 35 survivors had been found after the sinking early on Tuesday morning.
Rescue workers began recovering bodies from the double-decker Shariatpur 1 ferry, which was hit by another vessel in the middle of the Meghna river just southeast of the capital, Dhaka.
"The divers have brought seven dead bodies from the sunken vessel," Azizul Islam, the district administrator, told AFP by telephone.
He said 150 people were still unaccounted for.
Local police chief Shahidul Islam added that 35 passengers had been rescued by another ferry soon after the accident.
