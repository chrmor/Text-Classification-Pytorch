Jordanian UN peacekeepers freed in Darfur
Two kidnapped peacekeepers from the joint UN-African Union force in the western Sudanese region of Darfur have been released unharmed, three days after they were seized.
The Jordanian police advisers were freed in Kass, and later flown to a hospital in Nyala for check-ups. They were in good health, the UN said.
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen yards from their accommodation.
There has been a spate of kidnappings in recent years targeting foreigners.
Nineteen aid workers and members of the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (Unamid) have been seized since March 2009. All but one have been released.
Jordan's King Abdullah has ordered a military plane be sent to fly home the two peacekeepers released on Tuesday, reports say.
The UN says that about 300,000 people have been killed in Darfur and more than 2.6 million displaced since rebels took up arms in 2003.
