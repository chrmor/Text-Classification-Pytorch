Hurling star Lar Corbett denies rumours he's a €10.6m Lotto winner
ALL-Ireland winner Lar Corbett has finally denied he scooped the €10.6m jackpot of the National Lottery draw this week.
ALL-Ireland winner Lar Corbett has finally denied he scooped the €10.6m jackpot of the National Lottery draw this week.
Within hours of Wednesday evening's draw, when it was revealed that the winning Lotto ticket was bought in Thurles, word had spread that the Tipperary star had won.
The Irish Independent contacted Corbett as he touched down in New York last night, and when asked if he was indeed the winner, he replied: "I have been on a flight to New York all day, I don't know anything." However, the hurling star took to Twitter this morning to pour cold water on the theory.
"I would like to put a stop to all the story's about the €10,6 million it is not TRUE," he tweeted from his account @larcorbett. It is still unknown whether Lar's business partner Kevin Coppinger, with whom he co-owns a bar, was the lucky winner.
Mr Coppinger was unavailable to comment after some locals insisted that the pair owned the winning ticket. The Lotto quick-pick ticket worth €10.6m was sold in Scanlon's Newsagents shop on Liberty Square in the town. A Lotto spokeswoman said nobody had claimed the prize yet.
When asked if the pair had bought a ticket together on Wednesday, Corbett said: "Yeah, sure sometimes we might. We're in it together – when we play, we play it together." But he also said: "I don't know, you'd have to ring the bar to find out. Kevin Coppinger back in the bar looks after all that."
Pub manager John Lawlor insisted that he was in the dark. "We've been hearing these rumours all day." Barman Jaime Lennon was envious of whoever won the prize. "I'm going to Australia later this year so I could do with a few quid."
Vincent Scanlon, the owner of the shop where the winning €6 quick-pick was sold, was also remaining tight-lipped but he said he was delighted. "It is great news, a great day for someone in the town," he said. The winning numbers were 3, 8, 11, 23, 27 and 33. The bonus number was 36.
There were no winners of either of the two other draws. The Lotto Plus 1 numbers were 4, 17, 19, 23, 25 and 29 with a bonus number 3. In the Lotto Plus 2, the numbers were 7, 18, 20, 27, 37 and 38 with the bonus 29.
