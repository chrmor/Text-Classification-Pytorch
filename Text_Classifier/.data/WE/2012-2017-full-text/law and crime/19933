Cyberattack Knocks Out Access to Websites
The cyberattack that knocked out access to more than 1,200 websites including Netflix on Friday was launched with tactics used in past years by gamers looking to slow their opponents. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains.
Attackers controlling a vast collection of internet devices unleashed several massive attacks on Friday that left dozens of popular websites, including Twitter Inc. and Netflix Inc., unreachable for parts of the day.
Web-technology provider Dynamic Network Services Inc., known as Dyn, said its domain-name-system services were subject to a massive denial-of-service attack starting at 7:10 a.m. EDT on Friday. After the first onslaught was resolved, Dyn reported another wave of attacks that caused disruptions through the day.
