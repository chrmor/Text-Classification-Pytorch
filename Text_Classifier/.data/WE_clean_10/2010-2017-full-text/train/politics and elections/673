Moldova has new government: PM Chiril Gaburici received the vote of confidence
The Republic of Moldova’s appointed Prime Minister Chiril Gaburici received on Wednesday the vote of confidence from the deputies in Parliament of Moldova, informs Publika.md, noting that former PM Iurie Leanca did not vote for the new government.
According to the Constitution, if the Parliament gives its vote of confidence, president Nicolae Timofti appoints the new Executive.
In maximum three days, the ministers’ cabinet members will take the oath of allegiance to the President.
A first attempt of Government appointment, with Iurie Leanca as prime minister designate, has failed, writes Publika.md.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta greeted the election of a new government in Moldova. “Good luck to the new PM Gaburici and congratulations from the heart to Iurie Leanca for all the courageous reforms and projects carried out so far! I wish to work together for the welfare of citizens on both sides of the Prut, at least as well as I worked in 2014 with Leanca government,” Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also informed that “it took note of Moldova’s new Government swearing-in”. “The strict pursuing of the European integration’s goal, of reform achievement complying with the European standards will represent a confidence test for the political forces which voted for the new Government’s swearing-in,” reads a press statement issued by MFA.
