Yemens Saleh accepts Gulf peace plan
Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh has welcomed a Gulf Arab mediation plan that would see him hand power to his vice-president and create a new opposition-led government, a statement from his office said on Monday.
"The presidency welcomes the efforts of our brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council to solve the current crisis in Yemen," the statement said. "He (Saleh) has no reservations about transferring power peacefully within the framework of the constitution." (Reuters)
