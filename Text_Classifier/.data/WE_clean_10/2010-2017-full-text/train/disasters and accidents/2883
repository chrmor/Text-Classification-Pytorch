Qantas, Virgin cancel New Zealand flights
SYDNEY (MarketWatch) -- Australian airlines cancelled flights to and from New Zealand and postponed some to Argentina as a dust cloud from a Chilean volcano continues to throw travel plans into disarray.
Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN.AU) said it has cancelled all New Zealand flights for Thursday and postponed Wednesday's Buenos Aires flights until Friday.
"All Australian domestic services are operating normally," a spokesman said.
Virgin Australia Ltd. (VBA.AU) said it has suspended Auckland and Hamilton flights and others to Honiara and Tonga. It said these are in addition to the six Wellington and Christchurch flights cancelled Wednesday but didn't say whether flights to these cities have been reinstated.
