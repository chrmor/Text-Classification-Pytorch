Air Force to conduct aerial refueling drills with U.S.
SEOUL, July 11 (Yonhap) -- The Air Force will carry out aerial refueling drills with the U.S. on a regular basis starting later this year, a military official said Monday. "The F-15K and KF-16, our two main Air Force fighters, are capable of refueling in midair, but have never completed air-to-air refueling in our skies," the official said. "We will conduct the refueling exercise with a U.S. tanker every six months."   The official said a KC-135 Stratotanker, a U.S. Air Force jet stationed in Okinawa, Japan, will be dispatched for the first drill sometime in August or September.
