Boo Weekley triumphs at Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial
Boo Weekley claimed a maiden Crowne Plaza Invitational at Fort Worth after the American kept his cool to seal a one-shot victory ahead of Matt Kuchar.
Weekley was in contention for the win heading into the final round as a score of 66 on Saturday saw him finish tied for second, and on Sunday the 39-year-old hit the ball cleanly around the course to seal a deserved triumph with a four-under 66.
Weekley kicked off with a birdie on the first hole, and then made his second of the day in fine style, chipping a shot from 72 feet on the par-4 third to gain plenty of confidence.
A great tee shot on the eighth hole enabled Weekley to sink a birdie from three feet after two bogeys in the previous three holes.
The birdie on the eighth was one of three on the spin as Weekley impressed on the ninth and tenth holes, and then a 21-foot birdie on the par-3 13th put him on the verge of the victory as Kuchar required birdies to close the two-shot lead.
Weekley could have sealed the deal earlier on the 17th, but he failed to make birdie with the ball edging the rim. Kuchar on the same hole did not make birdie to stay in contention after almost putting from 20 feet, leaving Weekley to complete the victory on the 18th to a chorus of Boos around Colonial.
Last year's champion Zach Johnson had fired a final round of 66 to finish on 12-under and third in the standings well before Weekley and Kuchar signed off their rounds.
Johnson made five birdies in the day but a bogey on the 15th saw his slim hopes of retaining his title slip away.
