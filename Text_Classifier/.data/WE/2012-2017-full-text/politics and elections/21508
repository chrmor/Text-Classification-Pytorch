Donna Brazile finally admits giving debate questions to Clinton
Donna Brazile has finally come clean: Yes, the fix was in for Hillary Clinton during last year’s Democratic primary.
The former Democratic National Committee chair and ex-CNN contributor, in a piece published this weekend in Time magazine, acknowledged funneling inside info to the Clinton camp before two debates with Bernie Sanders.
“Among the many things I did in my role as Democratic operative and DNC vice chair ... was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign,” writes Brazile.
Emails published by WikiLeaks in October exposed the correspondence where Brazile tipped the Hillary camp about questions before the two Democratic Party showdowns.
“My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen,” she wrote. “But sending those emails was a mistake I will forever regret.”
A pair of emails from March 2016 showed Brazile advising Clinton’s communications director that Hillary would get questions about the death penalty at one debate and the Flint, Mich., water crisis at a second.
The leaks occurred while Brazile was working for the cable news station, which immediately cut ties with her when the scandal broke. CNN sponsored the debates.
Brazile, while insisting no one at CNN shared the questions in advance, refused to confirm her role in the mess.
Last October, Brazile said only that she would not “verify, deny, confirm or even try to make sense out of stolen emails that were hacked.”
