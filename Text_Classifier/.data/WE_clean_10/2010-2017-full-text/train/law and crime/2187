Filipino President: There’s No Genocide Here
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, whose drug war has killed nearly 2,000 alleged dealers without trial, denied Monday that his campaign is akin to genocide. In fact, Duterte told reporters, he would be willing to go to jail to defend his government’s efforts. Human-rights groups the world over have voiced concern about the state-sanctioned killings. “Genocide? Who did I kill? I did not kill any child. I did not drop barrel [bombs] like Assad,” Duterte said, pointing to Syria’s brutal leader. “I’m fighting ... criminals.” Duterte went on to call Islamic State terror group militants “idiots,” adding, “I do not burn women because they refuse to have sex.”
