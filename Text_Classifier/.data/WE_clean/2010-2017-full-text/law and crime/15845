Who were the three women set free from captivity in Cleveland?
Local police efforts are in question after calls were made by several neighbours over the past years, and was the suspect deliberately trawling for younger and younger girls? Fox News reports
THREE women have emerged from a house in Cleveland, Ohio, claiming to have spent years in captivity.
Amanda Berry, 27, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, were freed when a neighbour heard them screaming.
Police have a man, 52, identified as Ariel Castro, and two of his brothers, in custody in connection with the case.
"I am thankful that Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michele Knight have been found alive," proclaimed Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson.
"We have many unanswered questions regarding this case and the investigation will be ongoing."
As investigations continue, what do we know about these three young women and their abductions?
Ms Berry was last seen on April 21, 2003 when she was 16, near West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue in downtown Cleveland, Ohio.
She was leaving her job at Burger King and was walking home to a birthday party. She turned 17 the next day.
This morning, Ms Berry emerged from the house frantic and holding a child. "Help me!" she screamed. She told police the child was hers.
In 2006, three years after she went missing, Ms Berry's mother died of heart failure. Her family and friends say she died of a broken heart.
Ms DeJesus went missing on April 2, 2004 while she was walking home from school. She was 14.
Her mother, Ruiz DeJesus, had long been convinced her daughter was a victim of human trafficking.
"I always said it from the beginning; she was sold to the highest bidder," Ruiz DeJesus said last year.
The third girl found at the home in Cleveland, Michele Knight, was the first to disappear, in 2002 at age 20, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. She is now 32.
