MASSIVE PILEUP: Major pileup closes stretch of I-75, at least three people confirmed dead
Michigan State Police confirm three fatalities following a massive pileup on I-75.
Southbound I-75 at Springwells in southwest Detroit was closed for much of Thursday. Northbound I-75 was also closed at Schaefer, but reopened in the afternoon. Fifteen to 20 people have been transported to nearby hospitals.
Rob Morosi from MDOT tells 7 Action News the accident happened just after 9:00 a.m. over the Rouge River bridge. Semi trucks are involved and there are reports that at least one truck lost its load.
MDOT is reporting that at least 30 vehicles were involved in the pileup. Witnesses say there were white-out conditions at the time of the crash. The view from Chopper 7 shows the devastation. Dozens of smashed-up vehicles are all over the freeway.
The scene is also considered a HAZMAT Level 3 due to a fuel spill.

The freeway is expected to be closed for hours. Drivers are asked to avoid the area at this time. The actual accident scene stretches over a mile long.
The American Red Cross will head to the scene to aid accident victims and first responders.
An earlier article reported that the Michigan State Police confirmed four people had died in the accident. The police have since revised that fatality number to three.
