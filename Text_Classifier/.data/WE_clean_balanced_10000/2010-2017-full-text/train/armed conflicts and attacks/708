Somali militants launch deadly Kenya raid
At least six people have been killed in an attack by Somali militants on police posts over the Kenyan border, the Kenyan police have said.
At least two of the victims of the attack on the Abdisugow and Damajale posts were policemen.
A spokesman for the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab said it carried out the attack and that eight people had been killed.
An African Union force has weakened al-Shabab's power in Somalia in recent years but it still mounts border raids.
Al-Shabab, or "The Youth" in Arabic, has imposed a strict version of Sharia law in areas under its control in Somalia. It has been forced from towns and cities but still runs many rural areas.
David Kimaiyo, inspector general of Kenyan police, told the Associated Press news agency that six people were still missing after the attack on Saturday night.
Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, told Reuters news agency: "We have gone 35km (21 miles) into Kenya and burnt their base, Damajale, last night."
An al-Shabab social media posting said two people had been captured and taken into Somalia.
Albert Kimathi, district commissioner for the Dadaab area, confirmed the two attacks on police posts.
Mr Kimaiyo said: "We will pursue the attackers to the end."
Militants have staged numerous cross-border attacks since Kenya decided in October 2011 to send troops into Somalia to confront them.
The Kenyans form part of the African Union peacekeeping force that has weakened al-Shabab's power bases.
