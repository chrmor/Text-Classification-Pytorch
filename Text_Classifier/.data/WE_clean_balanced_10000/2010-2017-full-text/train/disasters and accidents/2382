Singapore Airlines Boeing in flames at Changi after turnback from flight to Milan
A Singapore Airlines plane erupted in flames shortly after making an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi Airport early on Monday, the airline has confirmed.
The plane had been flying from Singapore to Milan in Italy when it was forced to turn back due to engine trouble.
Footage taken by a witness shows the Boeing 777-300ER sitting on the tarmac as fierce flames and thick black smoke billow from its right wing.
Another video, obtained by The Straits Times, was shot out of the plane's window by one of the passengers on board.
