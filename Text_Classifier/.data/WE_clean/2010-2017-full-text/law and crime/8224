Unruly Crowd Vandalizes Police Cars At Hollywood Movie Premiere « CBS Los Angeles
HOLLYWOOD (CBS) — Police were unable to control an unruly crowd of roughly 2,000 people in Hollywood Wednesday night, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Karen Rayner said.
The crowd gathered at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre for the premiere of a documentary about the Electric Daisy Carnival, a rave that is now banned at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after a 15-year-old girl died from a drug overdose last summer. A party hosted by DJ Kaskade was scheduled to follow the film, Rayner said.
People refused to disperse and some began throwing bottles at officers. Two people were arrested for felony vandalism after three patrol cars were damaged.
Insomniac Inc., the organizers of the movie screening, issued a statement saying they were “disappointed that a small group of people would try to mar a private documentary screening,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
