Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, when discussing management of the flow of migrants with the press, talks about "technical security" measures but insists there will be "no fence" at the Slovenian border. This, in contrast to Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner who earlier spoke of plans for a "fence" on the border to Slovenia. Austria has been one of the more vocal countries criticizing Hungary's decision to build a fence along its border with Serbia. (AP) (BBC)
