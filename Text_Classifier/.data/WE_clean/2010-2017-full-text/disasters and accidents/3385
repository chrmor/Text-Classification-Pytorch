Asylum seekers 'feared dead' in Australia boat tragedy
Dozens of asylum seekers, including children, were feared dead after a boat sank in violent seas off Australia's Christmas Island, in what witnesses described as a "major tragedy".
Witness Phillip Stewart said on Wednesday he saw people drowning and others smashed against floating debris after their boat broke up against the limestone cliffs of the remote island off western Australia.
"The tragedy continued for some time and we witnessed people actually drowning.... Unfortunately (they) were hit against the rocks," he told Sky News.
Australian police confirmed that a suspected asylum seeker boat had been involved in an accident off Christmas Island.
"This response is ongoing and the AFP's (Australian Federal Police) priority is the safety of all involved in the incident," police said in a statement.
Stewart said he saw at least one person rescued by navy personnel, while others clung to bits of flotsam and jetsam from the boat.
