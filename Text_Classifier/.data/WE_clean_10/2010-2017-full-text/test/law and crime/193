Court bars US access to army bases
BOGOTA: Colombia's constitutional court has declared a US-Colombian agreement that gave the American military access to at least seven Colombian bases to be unconstitutional.
The court ordered the government to submit the agreement to the Colombian Congress, arguing it should be executed in the form of a treaty, subject to congressional approval to comply with constitutional norms.
The court's 6-3 decision said the ruling did not affect US military personnel and contractors working from Colombian bases covered by earlier accords.
This means any US personnel at the seven bases included in the pact could shift to bases permitted by previous agreements while the government decides whether to put the latest accord before Congress, where the new President, Juan Manuel Santos, has a big majority.
Last year's agreement with Washington intensified frictions with neighbouring Venezuela, whose President, Hugo Chavez, is a strong critic of US influence in Latin America. Brazil and Bolivia also criticised the deal, saying it would unsettle the balance of power in the region.
Mr Santos has defended the agreement on the grounds it ''improves our ability to combat drug trafficking and terrorism''.
