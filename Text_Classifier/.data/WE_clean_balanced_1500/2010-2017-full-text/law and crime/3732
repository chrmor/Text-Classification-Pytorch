In Iran, arrests made in attacks on scientists
Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Police have arrested several suspects allegedly connected to three spy agencies who were behind "recent terrorist attacks" targeting Iranian nuclear scientists, Iranian media reported Thursday.
"The three spy agencies of Mossad, CIA and M-I6 played a role in these attacks," the Iranian Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi said Thursday in interviews, referring to the Israeli, U.S., and British intelligence agencies.
Professor Majid Shahriari was killed but Professor Fereydoun Abbasi escaped with only minor wounds in two attacks Monday. Both were on the faculty of Shahid Beheshti University. Assailants on motorcycles attached bombs to cars carrying the professors at separate locations.
"With the arrest of these people, we have found new clues to arrest other elements," Moslehi said.
He said the people who worked with these agencies "were part an extensive organization and were planning more attacks but were stopped."
