Euro 2012: Uefa fine Germany and Portugal over missiles and delay
Germany and Portugal have been fined by Uefa following events during their Euro 2012 match on Saturday night.
The German Football Association was docked 10,000 euros (£8,000) after supporters threw missiles on to the pitch during the Group B game.
German fans threw screwed-up paper at Portugal players and were repeatedly warned through speaker announcements.
The Portuguese FA was fined 5,000 euros (£4,000) after players returned late for the second half, delaying kick-off.
Manchester City received a 30,000 euro fine for the same offence during a Europa League match at Sporting Lisbon in March.
Authorities told German supporters several times during the game that their behaviour could result in their ejection, sanctions for their team or even abandonment of the match.
