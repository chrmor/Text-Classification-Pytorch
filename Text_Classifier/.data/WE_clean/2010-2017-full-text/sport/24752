Sumo-Kotoshogiku ends Japan's long wait for home grown champion
Jan 24 (Reuters) - Kotoshogiku became Japan's first sumo champion in a decade after victory in the New Year Grand Tournament on Sunday.
The 31-year-old overpowered fellow Goeido to become the first Japanese wrestler to win an Emperor's Cup since Tochiazuma's 2006 triumph, Kyodo news agency reported.
Kotoshogiku went into the final day of the 15-day contest needing a win to secure his victory over Mongolian Hakuho, a 35-times champion, and long-time friend Toyonoshima.
The wrestler from Fukuoka achieved that in style, thrusting Goeido down at Ryogoku Kokugikan to clinch the title with a 14-1 record.
Sumo was practiced by only Japanese competitors from its first organised basho (tournament) in the 17th century until a little more than a hundred years ago, when foreign-born wrestlers began to participate.
