Military transport plane crashes in Morocco
A Moroccan military transport aircraft has crashed in the south of the country, the official MAP news agency said. The plane, a Hercules C-130, crashed into a mountain near the town of Guelmin, but the exact number of casualties was not yet known, MAP said. "This is a military plane that is used for the transport of troops, but also of their families. It is widely used in the Sahara," an interior ministry official told the AFP news agency. "Above all, it was the fog and bad weather conditions that are believed to be behind this accident. But for the moment, we don't have enough information". Citing unnamed sources, independent news portal Lakome.com said at least 20 of an estimated 70 passengers aboard the aircraft had died.
