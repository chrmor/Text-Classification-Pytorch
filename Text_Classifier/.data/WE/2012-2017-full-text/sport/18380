Mutko says no link between violence, World Cup
PARIS (AP) â€” The Latest from soccer's European Championship (all times local):
Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko spoke to The Associated Press as he left the stadium in Marseille, saying there were no comparisons between the violence in southern France and the 2018 World Cup.
Mutko says "what's the 2018 World Cup got to do with it?"
Russian fans clashed with England supporters and the police before and after Saturday's match at the Stade Velodrome.
Mutko is also the head of the Russian Football Union and has senior roles in FIFA and with World Cup organization.
World Cup organizing committee CEO Alexei Sorokin told reporters "the World Cup is in two years, this is a different tournament."
Fighting broke out in the southern city of Nice the night before the European Championship match between Poland and Northern Ireland.
It was not immediately clear who was involved in the fighting, but internet footage showed several fans wearing the dark green jersey of Northern Ireland trading punches with other fans.
The footage also showed riot police intervening quickly to stop the fighting, which appeared to involve about 20 people.
Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi condemned the fighting on his Twitter page, saying "the behavior of these hooligans is unacceptable and must be severely punished."
Estrosi added at about 11:30 p.m. that one person had been arrested in Nice's old town and that "the situation is calmer now." He then thanked the police force.
The teams play at 6 p.m. local time on Sunday.
The English Football Association has called on England fans "to act in a respectful manner and support England the right way" after a third day of violence in Marseille.
English and Russian fans clashed with each other and the French police, who deployed tear gas and water cannons both in the city's Old Port and near the Stade Velodrome ahead of England's game with Russia, which finished 1-1.
FA spokesman Mark Whittle says "the FA is very disappointed by the terrible scenes that we saw there and of course condemns such behavior." He called on French authorities "to identify those involved in the troubles and deal with them appropriately and quickly."
England coach Roy Hodgson refused to comment in detail on the incidents, but said the players "weren't particularly aware (of what happened) and it certainly had no effect on our preparation for the game and our performance in the game."
Eric Dier says England's emotions took a dive after Russia scored a late equalizer in Saturday's 1-1 draw.
Dier gave England the lead with a 73rd-minute curling free kick but says "our emotions went from a high to a low pretty quickly" when Vasily Berezutsky scored for Russia.
Asked if his free kick echoed those of David Beckham, Dier said "he was one of the best at it, and I've seen lots of his free kicks."
UEFA will open disciplinary proceedings over the violence in Marseille, with Russia facing the stronger sanctions after its fans attacked England supporters in the stadium.
After a third straight day of fighting in the Mediterranean port city, violence spread to the Stade Velodrome at Saturday's game.
After the 1-1 draw, a large group of Russian fans in one of the stands behind the goal advanced on England supporters in the neighboring area, throwing objects and breaking through a line of stewards. England fans fled for the exits.
When UEFA's disciplinary panel judges the latest incident in Marseille, it could take Russian fans' track record of violence into account, including at Euro 2012 when stadium security staff were attacked in Poland.
UEFA has changed the scorer of Russia's equalizer against England from Denis Glushakov to Vasily Berezutsky.
The match finished 1-1 after Berezutsky's header in injury time was judged by UEFA to have crossed the line before Glushakov provided the final touch.
Fans in the stadium starting fighting just as the final whistle blew after Russia came back to earn a 1-1 draw with England at the European Championship.

England and Russia won't receive UEFA sanctions because the disorder among fans at the European Championship has unfolded away from the stadium in Marseille.
European soccer's governing body tells The Associated Press "UEFA can only take disciplinary action for incidents which happen within the stadium perimeter."
