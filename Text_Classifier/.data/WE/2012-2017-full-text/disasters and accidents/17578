Former NTSB investigator was pilot in crash that killed 4 near Chugiak
The aircraft was registered to Kobelnyk, based on a tail number provided by National Transportation Safety Board investigator Shaun Williams. Kobelnyk had worked for both the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration in Alaska, according to his wife. According to the FAA database, Bohrer had a commercial pilot certificate issued in May 2015 and a flight instructor certificate issued in September 2015.

"No two airplanes come apart the same way. So that's a challenge. We have to sit there and go through every single piece, look at every break, every bend in the metal to determine exactly what caused this unfortunate event," he said.
