Free Syrian Army 'regrouping'
It is a ceasefire that few expect will last.
Under a UN-backed peace plan - the Syrian army and opposition fighters have laid down their weapons, but both sides know it is only a matter of time before the fighting resumes.
Al Jazeera has been speaking to the Free Syrian Army, which says it is using this lull to regroup and "strengthen their hand".
In this exclusive report, Al Jazeera's correspondent James Bays and cameraman Tom Nicholson report from al-Qusayr in the south of Syria.
