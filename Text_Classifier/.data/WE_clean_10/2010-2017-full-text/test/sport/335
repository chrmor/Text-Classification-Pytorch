Ayoub charged
Leading rugby league player-manager Sam Ayoub, 49, has been charged in connection with the police investigation into suspicious betting activity on a game last August.
Former rugby league player John Elias, 48, was arrested by detectives from the Casino and Racing Investigation Unit about 9.45am at a home in Punchbowl before being taken to Bankstown police station and later charged, like Ayoub, with attempting to defraud a number of betting agencies.
Detectives also executed a search warrant at a business premises on Hay Street in Leichhardt.
Additional charges were also laid against Bulldogs prop Ryan Tandy in court this morning, to do with his allegedly having provided false and misleading evidence to a NSW Crime Commission hearing.
