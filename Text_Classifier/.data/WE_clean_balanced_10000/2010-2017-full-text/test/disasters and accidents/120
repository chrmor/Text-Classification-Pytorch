Cargo plane crashes after take off in Colombia, killing five and injuring one
A cargo plane has crashed shortly after take-off from the southern Colombian city of Puerto Carreno, reportedly killing five and injuring one crew member.
The AeroSucre Boeing 727-200 aircraft crashed about 8 kilometres from Puerto Carreno's German Olano Airport on a flight bound for the Colombian capital.
The crash occurred at 5:23pm local time, about three minutes after take-off, the local Civil Aviation authority said in a statement.
The plane was carrying six crew members, five of which were killed, the authority said.
Eyewitness video appears to indicate the aircraft overshot the runway on takeoff.
The dramatic vision from Puerto Carreno resident Yurlan Falla shows the plane skimming the fence surrounding the airfield.
The cause of the crash is under investigation.
