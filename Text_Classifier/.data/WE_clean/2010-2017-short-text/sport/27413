Mo Farah of Great Britain wins the men's 5,000 metres to go along with his earlier gold medal in the 10,000 metres. By successfully defending his golds from the 2012 Games in both events, he becomes only the second man to win these two events at consecutive Olympics, alongside Lasse Vir√©n of Finland (1972 and 1976).
