Crowd fired upon in Toulouse
AT least one person is dead and six others injured in a shooting in the French city of Toulouse.
Local media report the shooting took place around 9pm, local time, (5am AEST) in the Abbal Square in the Reynerie district of the city, which lies in the south of France.
According to reports assailants riding a scooter and a motorcycle opened fired on a crowd in the square before fleeing.
Police cordoned off the area and confirmed one death.
Police have dismissed terrorism as a motive behind the incident, indicating it was more likely drug related.
Reports said the dead victim was known to the police.
“No possibilities are ruled out, but there is at this stage no indication of any terrorist element” connected to the incident,” a local official said, AFP reported.
The favoured theory is that the shooting was some revenge killing, a source close to the enquiry said.
Local officials, meanwhile, said extra security had been deployed to the area.
Last year the La Reynerie district, in the southwest of Toulouse, was the scene of two shooting incidents, both believed to be a settling of scores.
In one incident last July a Russian man of Chechen origin was shot dead by an unknown gunman on a scooter.`
Yesterday two hooded gunmen opened fire on a crowd outside a mosque in Avignon, also in the south of France.
Witnesses say the men arrived at Arrahma mosque in a Renault Clio around 10.30pm local time (6.30am AEST), leapt out and began firing at random.
One was armed with a handgun and the other with a rifle, local newspaper La Provence reports.
