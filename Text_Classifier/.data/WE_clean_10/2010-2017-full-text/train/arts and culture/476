What time are the 2012 Grammy Awards? It's a seemingly simple question, since the show starts at 5 p.m. Pacific on Sunday at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. But unless you have a ticket to the show or access to the East Coast feed, if you live in Southern California, you'll have to wait till 8 p.m. to see the Grammys on TV. Just like the East Coast, which gets to see the show live on CBS.
Regardless of the time, Adele, Kanye West, Foo Fighters, Bruno Mars, Lil Wayne and Skrillex are among the nominees, and country music legend Glen Campbell is being honored with a lifetime achievement award.
LL Cool J will host the 54th Grammy Awards, the first time in seven years that the Grammys have opted to have a host.
But there's more to the Grammys than the telecast itself, including a ceremony in the afternoon in which most of the awards are handed out, which you can follow live on the Pop & Hiss blog.
On TV, coverage and related programming begin early on CMT and pick up on E! and TV Guide Channel. See the list below.
“CMT Celebrates: Country Music at the Grammys,” 8 a.m. Sunday, CMT (5 a.m. on satellite systems): CMT takes a look at the country categories for this year's Grammy Awards. Included are videos for nominated country songs and artists.
