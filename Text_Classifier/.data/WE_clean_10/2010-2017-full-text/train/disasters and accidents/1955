UN plane crashes in DRC; at least 10 killed
At least 10 people are believed to have died when a UN plane with over 30 persons onboard crashed while attempting to land amid torrential rain in the DR Congo capital Kinhasa today.
The United Nations' office here said that it feared the fate of the 33 persons -- 29 passengers and four crew members after the plane crashed in Kinhasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
While CNN said at least 10 are believed to have died in the mishap, some media reports put the figure at more than 15.
The plane had been travelling from the north-eastern city of Kisangani and was trying to land in Kinshasa, Pelle Kipela Mondo, deputy editor-in-chief of Radio Okapi, which is co-managed by the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC (known as MONUSCO), said.
The crash occurred at around 1 p m (local time) when the pane attempted to land in the midst of torrential rain in Kinshasa.
The Kinshasa airport reported strong thunderstorms and sustained winds of 37 kph at the time.
MONUSCO staff rushed to the scene to help in the rescue efforts.
