Indonesia plane crash: death toll rises to 141 as investigation begins
Rescue workers still searching for victims on the ground after Hercules military aircraft crashed into Sumatran city of Medan
The death toll from the crash of an Indonesian military transport plane that careered into the side of a building in Medan on Tuesday has risen to 141.
Names of the 12 crew on board the C-130 Hercules plane have been released and authorities have confirmed that more than 100 passengers were also on board.
Search and rescue team resumed activities at the site on Wednesday morning and have confirmed that at least three people were killed on the ground, although that number is expected to rise.
The official numbers of people on the Hercules flight has fluctuated, with Indonesian air force spokesperson Dwi Bandarmanto confirming on Wednesday morning that 122 passengers, in addition to the 12 crew, had been on board.
“We had the list of the manifest and it was changing a lot. There was some children who were not named on the manifest, maybe five to eight children,” he explained.
The spokesperson said the majority of those on board were relatives of members of the military, but confirmed an investigation into whether the flight was also carrying paying passengers – which is prohibited – is underway.
Hitching rides on military planes to reach remote destinations is common in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago that spans three time zones. It is also common practice for government officials and relatives of military servicemen to take military flights, with permission from the base commander.
The plane had reportedly travelled from the capital, Jakarta, and stopped at two locations before arriving at Medan.
It is still unclear how many people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed into houses and a hotel in the densely populated city of Medan. Access to one of the buildings damaged by the crash remained blocked on Wednesday morning.
Search and rescue teams have so far pulled dozens of bodies from the rubble and 142 body bags have been sent to Adam Malik general hospital, where distraught relatives have gathered to identify the remains.
Several rows of wooden coffins were seen lying outside the hospital in Medan, Indonesia’s third-largest city. Officers wearing face masks and white gloves carried the coffins of those bodies that have been identified into trucks for transport to families.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo told reporters on Wednesday morning that the crash had provided the necessary “momentum” to update the country’s existing military hardware. The president has instructed authorities to conduct an in-depth investigation into what caused Tuesday’s crash. “I have also instructed the Minister of Defence and Commander in Chief (TNI) to undertake a fundamental overhaul of the management of military defense equipment, defense procurement system must be changed, this is the momentum,” he said.
“The most important procurement should be directed to the independence of the defense industry so that we can fully control the readiness of defense equipment.”
Widodo had earlier offered his condolences to the victims and their families, before called for the military’s ageing hardware to be examined.
“The evacuation of victims from the Hercules plane must be prioritised. Then there must be an evaluation of the age of planes and defence systems,” the president tweeted on Tuesday evening.
“Hopefully, we can stay away from disasters.”
The Hercules C-130 that crashed on Tuesday was produced in 1964, but authorities have maintained that it was fit to fly and regularly transported military personnel.
It is unclear what led to the crash, although local residents who witnessed the plane as it went down said they saw smoke before it crashed, which could indicate engine failure.
“The pilot requested to turn back, there must have been some damage,” the chief of staff of the air force, Marshal Agus Supriyatna, told Tribunnews in Medan on Tuesday. “But at the time of the handle back there were not able to make it.”
Speculation the Hercules plane crashed due to mechanical error will not be confirmed until further investigations are complete, he said. “I have not been able to confirm them [the parties involved]. However, usually, it can be a malfunction in one of the engines or the hydraulics.”
Indonesia has a chequered air safety history, with 10 fatal crashes involving Indonesian military or police aircraft in the last decade, according to the Aviation Safety Network.
In 2009, an Indonesian air force Hercules hit four houses before skidding into a rice field, killing 95 people on board and two on the ground.
In December, an Airbus A320 run by AirAsia crashed on a flight from Indonesia to Singapore, killing all 162 people on board.
