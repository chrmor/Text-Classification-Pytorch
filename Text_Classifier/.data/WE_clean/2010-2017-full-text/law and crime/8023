World Service reporter freed on bail
BBC World Service reporter Urunboy Usmonov has been released from prison in Tajikistan on bail. I reported yesterdaythat he was said to be "frail and frightened" after spending more than a month in jail.
Usmonov, pictured here, was reportedly held on accusations that he was a member of Hizbut-Tahrir, an extreme Islamic organisation. This was strenuously denied by his family and the BBC. Peter Horrocks, the director BBC global news, said: "We are encouraged that Tajik authorities have considered our appeals.
"As we have said all along, we believe Urunboy is innocent and all he was doing was his journalistic work for the BBC. "We know that his family and friends are delighted to have Urunboy back and are appreciative of the support from colleagues at the BBC and around the world."
