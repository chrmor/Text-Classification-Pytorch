8 babies saved, 3 people dead in Mexico City hospital blast
Eight babies were recovered from the rubble of an explosion near a children's hospital in Mexico City that killed three people and injured dozens Thursday morning.
A gas tank exploded outside a maternity and children's hospital, destroying most of the medical center, officials said. A leak in a hose carrying the gas caused the explosion, near the hospital's loading dock. 
The blast injured more than 70 people, including nearly two dozen children. It also killed a nurse and two children. Around 100 people were in the hospital when the explosion happened.
“There was a super explosion and everything caught on fire,” said Ismael Garcia, who lives just a block from the hospital.
The 27-year-old rushed to the scene, where he and others made their way to the nursery.
“Fortunately, we were able to get eight babies out,” he said.
