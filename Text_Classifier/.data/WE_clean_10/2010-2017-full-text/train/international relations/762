Tuvalu to support Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia
Tuvalu has become the latest Pacific Islands country to recognise the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia.
Last week the Tuvalu prime minister, Willy Telavi, was in Sukhumi in Abkhazia to sign an agreement to establish diplomatic relations.
They have committed to a relationship based on friendship and a spirit of close cooperation in the political, cultural and educational spheres.
Russia recognises Abkhazia and South Ossetia and last year Nauru committed to back both territories and received a substantial commitment in aid from Moscow.
In July, Vanuatu came out in support of Abkhazia but amid confusion within the Port Vila government this was later withdrawn.
