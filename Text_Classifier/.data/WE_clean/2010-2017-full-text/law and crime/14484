India executes parliament attack planner
India Saturday executed a man convicted of plotting a militant raid on the nation's parliament in 2001.
The man, Mohammed Afzal Guru, was hanged to death Saturday morning, said R.K. Singh, the federal home secretary.
Guru was executed after the Indian president had rejected the condemned prisoner's clemency petition, Singh said.
The convict had denied role in the December 13, 2001 assault that had left nine people dead. All five militants were also killed by Indian security forces deployed on the parliament compound.
India rarely executes its death row convicts. But Guru's hanging came on the heels of the execution last year of Pakistani Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving gunman in the 2008 terror siege of Mumbai.
Authorities in India have blamed Pakistani-backed militants for the attack on their parliament that then led to massive mobilization of troops by the the two nuclear neighbors along their tense borders. Pakistan denied involvement.
India's Hindu nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been demanding hanging of Guru, welcomed the execution.
