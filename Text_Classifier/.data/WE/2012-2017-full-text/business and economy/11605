Putin calls for cheaper vodka as Russian economy stumbles
That’s the message Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Wednesday when he ordered vodka prices reined in.
The nation’s economy, saddled with sanctions and sagging oil prices, is more wobbly than a drunken pensioner. Adding to the woes, Russia’s currency has plunged; the ruble is down 40 percent against the dollar and euro in 2014.
"The overshoot of vodka prices leads only to increasing consumption of bootleg (spirits)," said Putin, according to The Moscow Times. "I think the relevant structures (government bodies) should think of that.”
Putin’s point highlights a stark fact about Russian men: A quarter of the nation’s men die by their 50s, according to a university study, Reuters reported.
Skyrocketing government-regulated vodka prices – up 30 percent in the last year to $4.10 for a half-liter bottle — means more bootleg alcohol will reach market. Unregulated vodka made by unscrupulous producers poses a potential health threat.
Russia is in the grips of its most critical economic crisis since the county defaulted on its debt in 1998. And inflation is expected to top 10 percent this year, the Times reported.
For now: Let the vodka flow.
