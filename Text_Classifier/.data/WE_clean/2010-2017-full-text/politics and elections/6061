China arrests dissident as crackdown continues
Zhu Yufu was detained on March 5 for writing a poem in support of the online calls for demonstrations that have been circulating in China in the wake of pro-democracy protests in the Middle East. His arrest follows the detention of the artist Ai Weiwei on April 3rd.
Mr Zhu's ex-wife Jiang Hangli said that police told her he has now been accused of 'inciting subversion of state power', a catch-all charge frequently used against anyone who challenges the ruling communist party.
His arrest follows that of three other dissidents on the same charge. It indicates how determined Beijing is to stamp out any expression of public discontent.
Mrs Jiang, though, denied that Mr Zhu had been involved in organising the calls for a 'Jasmine Revolution'.
"Before he was detained, he'd been followed everywhere he went, 24 hours a day, for 20 days by the security people, so he never had a chance to participate in any political activities," said Mrs Jiang.
But the 58-year-old, from Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province near Shanghai, had written a poem suggesting people go for a stroll in the streets.
'Going for a stroll' has become a euphemism for demonstrations by supporters of political change.
While not as prominent a figure as Ai Weiwei, Mr Zhu is a long-time pro-democracy activist. A former magazine editor, he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1999 for his part in founding the banned China Democracy Party, and served a further two years after being rearrested a year after his release in 2006.
