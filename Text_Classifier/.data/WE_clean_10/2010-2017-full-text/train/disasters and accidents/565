Benin receives UN flood aid amidst cholera outbreak
The UN refugee agency is to start an emergency airlift of tents to the West African nation of Benin which has seen its worst flooding in decades.
Around 3,000 tents will be flown in from Denmark to provide shelter for some of the estimated 680,000 people affected.
Much of the country has suffered from months of heavy rain, and now hundreds of cases of cholera are being reported.
