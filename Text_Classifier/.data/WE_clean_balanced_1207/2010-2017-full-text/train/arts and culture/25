Original Godzilla actor Haruo Nakajima dies aged 88
Haruo Nakajima, the actor who played movie monster Godzilla over two decades of Japanese cinema, died at 88.
The Yamagata, Japannative first wore the famed bodysuit of the movie monster in the 1954 film Godzilla, which was released stateside as Godzilla, King of the Monsters.
Nakajima was featured in movies such as Eagle of the Pacific and Seven Samurai prior to landing the career-defining part, for which he had to don a 100-plus pound suit that was made of concrete.
Speaking with Great Big Story in March, he revealed that the reason the heavy concrete was used instead of rubber was because of a shortage of the latter stemming from World War II.
'It was so heavy and hot, and with the lighting, it was even hot to touch it,' he told Great Big Story. 'I was sweating all over my face, but I did the best I could.'
He said he visited the zoo in Tokyo to get a feel for how to move around like the monster by observing 'big animals, like elephants and gorillas.'
Nakajima subsequently went on to play Godzilla a series of sequels, including 1955's Godzilla Raids Again, 1962's King Kong vs. Godzilla, 1954's Mothra vs. Godzilla, 1969's All Monsters Attack and 1972's Godzilla vs. Gigan, his last film in the role. He also worked as a stunt choreographer on many of the franchise films.
In addition to his efforts in the role of Godzilla, Nakajima was featured as King Kong in 1967's King Kong Escapes. Nakajima, a regular on the monster convention circuit, released his memoirs, Monster Life: Haruo Nakajima, the Original Godzilla Actor, in 2010.
'In the end, the Godzilla I played remains on film forever,' he told Great Big Story. 'It remains in people's memory and for that I feel really grateful.'Â
