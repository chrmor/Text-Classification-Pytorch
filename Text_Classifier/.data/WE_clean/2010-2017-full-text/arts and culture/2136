Vatican full for making of Aussie, Canadian saints
Tens of thousands of people have packed St. Peter's Square for the canonization of Australia's first saint and that of a Canadian brother considered by the faithful a "miracle worker."
Four other people, from Poland, Italy and Spain, were also being declared saints Sunday during a Mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI. (AP)
