Over 500,000 people took part in Europride 2011 gay festival in Italy's Rome, RIA Novosti correspondent said on Saturday.
The participants of the parade urge to respect their rights, stop discrimination and permit the single-sex marriages. They carry the slogans, reading "Equal in love, unequal in rights. Let's defend them together."
"We should live in a country where those different from the others are respected. We do not pose a threat..." the head of Italy's eastern Apulia region, Nichi Vendola said.
In late May over 30 gay parade supporters and opponents were arrested in Moscow after staging an unsanctioned rally.
Moscow continues to stand against gay parades with the police enforcing the city's ban on a protest by gay rights campaigners in the Russian capital.
