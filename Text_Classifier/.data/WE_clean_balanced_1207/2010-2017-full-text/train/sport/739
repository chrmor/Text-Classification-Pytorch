NBC Wins TV Rights to 4 Olympics for $4.38 Billion
“We’ve said all along that we’d take a disciplined approach, where we could take a path to profitability,” Roberts said in a conference call. “It was responsible.”
Still, Comcast is paying considerably more than Fox to keep the Olympics in the NBC family than General Electric did for the Vancouver and the Games. Neal Pilson, a former CBS Sports president, said, “I think Brian felt some pressure to validate the merger, and I think this also establishes that, as everyone felt, the Olympics were more important to NBC than they were to any other network.”
ESPN and Fox bid as if they did not feel they had to win the auction. In a statement, ESPN said: “We made a disciplined bid that would have brought tremendous value to the Olympics and would have been profitable for our company. To go any further would not have made good business sense for us.”
Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Comcast’s winning bid was out of character for a company that has been “relatively cautious.” But, he added: “I think it’s fair to say that at this price, the Olympics are going to be a loss leader for Comcast and they will have a negative effect on short-term earnings. Still, strategically, it’s possible they can pay for themselves.”
By combining NBC’s broadcast and cable networks with Comcast’s sports assets, which include the Versus sports channel, the Golf Channel and 11 regional sports networks, Roberts said he believed his Olympic could turn a profit. Mark Lazarus, the chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said that there were more ways to make an Olympic profit “than the old NBC was capable of doing.”
NBC’s Olympic cable coverage has in the past been on the USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and Oxygen channels. The old NBC was personalized by , who ran the network’s sports division for nearly 22 years until resigning last month in a salary dispute that was the climax of a power struggle with Comcast executives. Ebersol had been critical to every Olympic bid since the acquisition of the rights to the 1996 Summer Games; he also engineered two pre-emptive bids within a few months in 1995 that brought NBC the rights to every Olympics from 2000 to 2008, at a cost of $3.5 billion to General Electric.
The timing of Ebersol’s departure puzzled Barry Frank, an executive vice president of I.M.G. and a former Olympic negotiator. “Why would you let Dick Ebersol go, and a month later, buy four Olympic Games, when what Dick did best, better than anyone else, is produce the Olympics?” he said Tuesday.
Clearly, Comcast felt it could could replace Ebersol in NBC’s executive suite with Lazarus, and replace Ebersol in the Olympic production control room with some of his disciples. Comcast is also ending Ebersol’s practice of tape-delaying many sports, especially the most popular ones, like and gymnastics, and more recently, , to build a four- or five-hour prime-time program.
Even as NBC introduced online streaming, Ebersol nonetheless delayed showing some events during the 2008 Summer Games in and even more last year in Vancouver.
But fans grew angry with NBC’s ways as they found it increasingly easy to learn the results of Olympic events, or watch events live on pirate Web sites. Lazarus said NBC felt it was time to make all events available live, to all coasts, on television, on broadband, and perhaps through other technologies.
“We have a smart plan to let the superfan watch events live and not detract from prime time,” Lazarus said. “We don’t think that streaming will affect the shared experience of families watching together at night.”
NBC will still have a traditional package in prime time, with taped and live coverage.
Comcast did not reveal any production plans, but one addition to the lineup of networks, probably in time for London next year, will be Versus. Comcast’s hope is to use the Olympics as a way to raise its number of subscribers and the monthly fees they pay. “If you can add 20 or 30 million subscribers,” Pilson said, “and raise fees by 30 or 40 cents a sub, that’s significant money.”
The auction began Monday with Fox’s presentation, which was followed Tuesday by ESPN’s and NBC’s pitches. After NBC’s presentation, all three networks deposited sealed bids in a plexiglass box. Fox dropped in four envelopes, ESPN put in two and NBC dropped in a thin envelope and a noticeably thicker one. The I.O.C. deliberated for several hours and did not tell ESPN and Fox they had lost until well after informing NBC of its victory.
What I.O.C. officials saw inside the envelopes were the details of the Comcast/NBC bid: $775 million for Sochi, below the $820 million paid for the money-losing Vancouver Games; $1.22 billion for Rio de Janeiro in 2016; $963 million for the 2018 Winter Games — which will be in ; Pyeongchang, , or , — and $1.41 billion for the 2020 Summer Games.
“We were blown away by the NBC presentation and the passion the team has for the Olympics” Richard Carrion, the I.O.C. member in charge of the auction, said in the conference call.
But he added, “I’d be less than honest if I said the dollars didn’t come into play.”
