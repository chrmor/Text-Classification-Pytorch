Ready Steady Cook gets the chop
Ready Steady Cook, one of the shows that kickstarted UK TV's lifestyle programming boom in the mid 1990s, is being axed by the BBC after nearly 16 years.
The show is being dropped as part of a move by the BBC to reinvigorate its daytime programming.
The show, which has been fronted by Ainsley Harriott since 2000, began in 1994 and is thought to be the longest-running cookery show currently on TV. Ready Steady Cook was originally launched with Fern Britton as host.
No more new series of the show are to be made and the final episodes, a run of repeats, will disappear from screens at some point next year. A total of 21 series and almost 2,000 episodes of the Endemol-produced UK show have been made to date. The format has been sold to more than 20 countries around the world.
"BBC Daytime is constantly looking at ways to innovate and refresh our programme formats and, while the series has been hugely popular on BBC2, it was felt that Ready Steady Cook has been taken as far as it could," said the BBC head of daytime, Liam Keelan.
The programme will be replaced by other cooking shows featuring stars such as the Hairy Bikers, David Myers and Simon King. Keelan is also looking to introduce more drama to the daytime schedule, with shows such as Moving On and the forthcoming series The Indian Doctor set to run on BBC1 in the afternoon.
Harriott said: "I feel privileged to have been part of the Ready Steady Cook family for the past 15 years. I am immensely proud of its success as the longest running cookery show on British television and will always look back on it with the fondest of memories."
