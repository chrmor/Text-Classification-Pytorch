US ambassador to Russia steps down
Michael McFaul scored successes with arms treaty and Afghanistan but also witnessed growth of anti-Americanism
The US ambassador to Russia has announced he is stepping down after two turbulent years in Moscow.
Michael McFaul is considered the architect of President Barack Obama's effort to improve relations with Russia.
McFaul can point to many successes in US-Russian relations, including the negotiation of a new strategic arms treaty and co-operation on the Nato-led military campaign in Afghanistan. But his tenure also has brought disappointments in the face of the rising anti-Americanism in Russia that accompanied Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.
The ambassador announced his departure in a blogpost on Tuesday, saying he would leave after the Sochi Winter Olympics. He explained that, having lived apart from his wife for seven months, "it is time for the family to be reunited".
"I love my job here. It has been a tremendous honour to represent my country in Russia and I made this decision with a heavy heart," McFaul said. "I will greatly miss interacting with my partners in the Russian government and with Russians from all sectors of society and business. I also will miss being part of a fantastic team at Embassy Moscow."
A longtime Stanford University professor, McFaul said he would be returning to California. His wife and two sons had returned home last year.
