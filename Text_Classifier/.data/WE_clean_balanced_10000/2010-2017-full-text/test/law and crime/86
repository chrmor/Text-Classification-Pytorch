About 100 people, several of them armed with non-lethal weapons, were detained near the All-Russian Exhibition Center (VVTs) in northeastern Moscow on Saturday, a police source told RIA Novosti.
"Several groups of youth, each containing from ten to twenty people, were detained near the central entrance to [the park surrounding] VVTs and in close vicinity to the exhibition center. These citizens were detained in order to prevent and suppress unlawful acts," the source said.
Earlier in the day, the National Democratic Alliance movement held a sanctioned rally in front of the Moscow's Ostankino TV center, which is located not far from VVTs. The participants of the rally protested the "incorrect" media coverage of a range of events.
Policemen cordoned off the territory around the TV center and did not interfere into the rally. However, the protesters headed to the park nearby with a view to continue the meeting in an other place.
Police blocked the exits from the park and begun to detain the rioters. The majority of those detained in the park are teenagers, police spokesman Viktor Biruykov said, without defining exactly how many had been detained.
The Russian capital saw its biggest public disturbances for almost a decade when a 5,000-strong crowd of nationalists and football hooligans clashed with police at central Manezh Square last Saturday, December 11. The fans were protesting police negligence over the death of Yegor Sviridov, 28, who was killed in a brawl with migrants from Russia's North Caucasus region earlier in November.
The clash was followed on Wednesday by further disturbances as ethnic Russians and internal migrants gathered for a confrontation near a major train terminus in Moscow. Race-hate riots also occurred in St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
New race-related riots may be held in Moscow on Saturday RosBusinessConsulting (RBC) news service said on its website citing Internet bloggers.
According to unofficial information on the Internet, retaliatory riots may be organized by ethnic Russians and internal migrants on Manezh Square, where mass disturbances occurred last week. Police beef up security regime in the city. So far, the situation there is calm.
