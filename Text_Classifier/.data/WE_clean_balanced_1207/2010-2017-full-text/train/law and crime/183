Assange moved to isolation
Police moved WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange to the segregation unit of a London jail for his safety, his lawyer said on Friday as new cables showed the US suspects Burma has a secret nuclear program.
The 39-year-old Australian has been moved from the main part of Wandsworth prison to an isolation unit, said Jennifer Robinson, one of Assange's legal team.
"The prison authorities are doing it for his own safety, presumably," she told AFP.
Assange is due to appear in a London court for a second time on Tuesday after being arrested on a warrant issued by Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women.
WikiLeaks insists the allegations are politically motivated because the whistleblowing website has enraged Washington and governments around the world by releasing thousands of US diplomatic cables.
Robinson complained that Assange "does not get any recreation" in the prison and "has difficulties getting phone calls out... he is on his own."
