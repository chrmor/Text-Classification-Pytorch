Spalding shooting: Recap after man kills wife and daughter with shotgun then kills himself outside swimming pool
A husband shot dead his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself in a suspected murder-suicide in a swimming pool car park.
Lance Hart, 57, is said to have used a shotgun to kill wife Claire, 50, and their 19-year-old daughter Charlotte in the Castle Sports Complex swimming pool in Spalding, Lincolnshire, at about 9am today.
Emergency services desperately attempted to save Claire and Charlotte but the father-of-three, said to be a delivery driver for a builders' merchants, was already dead.
The family had recently sold their Â£240,000 four-bed detached house in the nearby village of Moulton but still lived there.
Charlotte was believed to be studying at the University of Northampton but was home for the summer holidays while mum Claire worked at the local Morrisons.
