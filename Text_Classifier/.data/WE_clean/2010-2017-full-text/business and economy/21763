People’s Bank of China Cuts Interest Rates
BEIJING—After more than a week of a brutal selloff in Chinese stocks, the country’s central bank on Saturday took a rare easing step, cutting both its benchmark interest rates and the amount of reserves certain banks are required to hold.
In a statement, the People’s Bank of China said both steps were aimed at lowering borrowing costs and “stabilizing growth” in the world’s second-largest economy.
