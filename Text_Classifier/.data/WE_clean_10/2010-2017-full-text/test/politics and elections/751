German chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party has suffered a major setback in a crucial state vote ahead of national elections next year.
Preliminary results indicate the Christian Democratic Union took just over 25 per cent of the vote in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
It is the party's worst ever showing in the country's most populous state, and could embolden the left opposition to step up its criticism of her European austerity policies.
The vote in North Rhine-Westphalia was held 18 months before a national election in which Ms Merkel is expected to fight for a third term.
She remains popular in Germany for her steady handling of the eurozone debt crisis, but the sheer scale of her party's defeat leaves her vulnerable at a time when a backlash against her insistence on fiscal discipline is building across Europe.
According to first projections, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) won 38.8 per cent of the vote and will have enough to form a stable majority with the Greens, who scored 12.2 per cent.
The two left-leaning parties had run a fragile minority government for the past two years under popular SPD leader Hannelore Kraft, whose decisive victory on Sunday could propel her to national prominence.
Ms Merkel's party saw their support plunge to just 25.8 per cent, down from nearly 35 per cent in 2010.
The blow comes only two days before France's new president, Socialist Francois Hollande, is due to visit Berlin and press Ms Merkel for a shift away from austerity and more emphasis on growth-oriented measures in Europe.
Other big countries like Italy also want Ms Merkel to take a more balanced approach to the debt crisis and an election in Greece last week showed massive public resistance to tough austerity.
