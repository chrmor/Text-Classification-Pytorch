Eggs thrown at Bank of Ireland CEO, Chairman
Eggs have been thrown at Bank of Irelandâ€™s Chairman Pat Molloy and CEO Richie Boucher at the Annual General Meeting.
The rotten eggs missed the two executives.
They were thrown by shareholder Gary Keogh from Blackrock, Co Dublin.
Mr Keogh, who also threw eggs at AIB's AGM in 2009, was escorted from the meeting by security.
Speaking afterwards, he said throwing the eggs had helped 'bring his blood pressure down'.
Shareholder Mary Farrell told Bank of Ireland governor Patrick Molloy that she had been robbed and that the group is robbing shareholders again this year. She said the board is guilty of elder abuse.
Mr Molloy said the environment for the group remained difficult, but he said there were indications the economy has stabilised.
He said progress has been made to make BoI more focused, but factors outside its control had affected the bank.
He added that losses on loans transferred to the National Asset Management Agency were higher than anticipated.
Mr Molloy said the bank's costs had been reduced by 17% since 2008, with staff numbers down by 2,400 or 14% and further redundancy programmes under way.
He said the group's total loan book has been reduced by 20% since September 2008 and its strategy was to return to a more traditional retail structure.
The AGM also heard that Bank of Ireland wanted to retain its College Green branch despite a desire by the State to acquire it.
Mr Molloy said the branch had 30,000 customers and was an important part of Bank of Ireland's bottom line.
