Brilliant Bolt blows away the sceptics along with 100m field
Why did we ever doubt him? The imperiousness with which Usain Bolt demolished the questions over his own fallibility on Sunday night in London made fools of us all. For now we know what we should have known then: that Usain Bolt is not only the Olympic 100m champion again, he is what he has long professed he will become – a legend and probably the greatest athlete ever.
Bolt did not only win comfortably, he also scotched the very idea of loss and dragged forward the idea of what was possible. He won the Olympic 100m final in a time quicker than any had ever done before and in the second fastest time he has ever run, just 0.05 seconds outside his own world record. But in going so fast, he also carried with him a field of runners who all – save for Asafa Powell, who suffered an injury mid-race – ran under 10 seconds.
It was the fastest race ever and one of the greatest. It was great because it was quick, but to Bolt it was the sweetest victory of all because it came at a time when the world was asking questions about him. Was he still the best? Were his best years behind him? Was he lazy?
‘‘It means more because people doubted me, saying that a lot of people could have beat me and I was not looking good,’’ Bolt said. ‘‘They were saying things of me. It means more because I have shown the world that without a doubt I am the best. And this is where I wanted to become – a legend, and this is one step in the door.
