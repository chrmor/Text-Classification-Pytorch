Janet Yellen Says Economy Is Ripe for Fed Interest Rate Increase
WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that economic conditions were ripe for the Fed to start raising its benchmark interest rate this month, a move that appears all but inevitable barring a sharp change in the economic weather.
“I think the economy is on the road to recovery,” Ms. Yellen said. “We’re doing well.”
While insisting the Fed’s policy-making committee would not make a final decision until its meeting Dec. 15 and 16, Ms. Yellen said raising rates would be “a testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession.”
“It is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to,” she said.
The remarks by Ms. Yellen, before the Economic Club of Washington, and by other Fed officials in separate appearances on Wednesday, suggested that Fed officials had concluded that the economy was strong enough to keep growing with less support from the central bank.
The Fed has held short-term rates near zero for seven years, seeking to stimulate the economy by pushing lenders to take larger risks and encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow. When the Fed begins to raise interest rates, it will reduce those incentives.
