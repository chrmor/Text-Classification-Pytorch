Two police officers were killed and one injured when their car came under fire in Russia’s North Caucasus Republic of Dagestan on Monday, a spokesman for the region’s investigative committee said.
Unidentified gunmen hiding in a forest opened fire at a police car with four officers in the republic’s Tsuntinsky District at about 1:00 p.m. Moscow time [09:00 GMT].
“Two police died as a result, and one officer was hospitalized with various injuries,” the spokesman said.
The troubled region sees frequent attacks on law enforcement officers and government officials as Moscow continues to battle an Islamist insurgency there. At least 12 militant groups made up of about 300 people are believed to be operating in Dagestan.
Poor economic conditions and unemployment are thought to be the main factors driving local residents to join militant groups.
