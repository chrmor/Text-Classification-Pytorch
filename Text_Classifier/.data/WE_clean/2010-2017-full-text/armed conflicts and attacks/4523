Gunfire kills three people in Cairo
At least three people have been killed in pre-dawn gunfire in Cairo's Tahrir Square, witnesses say.
Protest organiser Mustafa el-Naggar said he saw the bodies of three dead protesters being carried toward an ambulance, after bursts of heavy gunfire rained into Tahrir Square early on Thursday.
Sustained bursts of automatic weapons fire and powerful single shots rattled into the square starting about 4am (1300 AEDT), and were continuing more than an hour later.
The protesters were among crowds still trying to hold the site after an assault by supporters of President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday.
El-Naggar said the gunfire came from at least three locations off in the distance and that the Egyptian military, which has ringed the square with tank squads for days to try to keep some order, did not intervene.
Footage from AP Television News showed two bodies being dragged from the scene.
