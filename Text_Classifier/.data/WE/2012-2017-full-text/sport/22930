P.G.A. Championship Will Move from August to May in 2019
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The P.G.A. Championship will move from August to May, starting in 2019, the P.G.A. of America announced on Tuesday.
Instead of being the final major of the year, the P.G.A. Championship will become the second, after the Masters in April. The United States Open is held in June, followed by the British Open in July.
The reintroduction of golf at the Olympics was a major reason for moving the P.G.A. Championship, said Pete Bevacqua, the chief executive of the P.G.A. of America.
Bevacqua, speaking at a joint news conference with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan at Quail Hollow Club, said it was important for his organization to seize the moment.
“The landscape of golf is changing and it’s changing because of the Olympics,” he said. “We think that this is in the best interests of the P.G.A. of America and the P.G.A. Championship to make this move to position us for the next hundred years of the P.G.A. Championship.
