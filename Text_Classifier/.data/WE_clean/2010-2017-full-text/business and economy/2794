BHP Billiton abandons Potash fertiliser bid
Mining giant BHP Billiton Monday abandoned its 39 billion US dollar takeover bid for fertiliser-maker Potash Corp after it was rejected by Canada, acknowledging its second major failure in recent weeks.
The world's biggest miner, whose 116 billion US dollar iron ore merger with Rio Tinto collapsed last month, said its "unparalleled" pledges on jobs and investment could not convince the country's government of the deal's merits.
"Unfortunately, despite having received all required anti-trust clearances for the offer, we have not been able to obtain clearance under the Investment Canada Act and have accordingly decided to withdraw the offer," chief executive Marius Kloppers said.
Canada's Potash said BHP's offer "substantially undervalued" the world-leading manufacturer of fertiliser, considered strategically important as global food security worries mount.
The bid "failed to reflect both the value of our premier position in a strategically vital industry and our future growth prospects", Potash said in a statement.
The deal's formal demise comes shortly after BHP's iron ore joint venture with arch-rival Rio was shelved in October after opposition from a swathe of foreign regulators on anti-competition grounds.
