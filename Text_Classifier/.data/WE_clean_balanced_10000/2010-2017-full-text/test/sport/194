Australia regained the Cormac McAnallen trophy with a thrilling three-point win in the second and final match of the International Rules series in Dublin.
The 0.14.13 (55) to 1.11.13 (52) victory at Croke Park in front of 61,000 fans handed Australia a 2-0 series win following their seven-point triumph in the series opener in Limerick.
The Irish again produced a storming finish with 14 unanswered points to lead by four points more than halfway through the final term before the tourists rallied on a cool, clear night.
In the dying seconds, goalkeeper Dustin Fletcher managed to scramble back in front of goal to save a low shot from Goulding before getting the ball to safety.
Dane Swan was awarded the Jim Stynes Medal after being named player of the series for the Australian side just four weeks after lifting the AFL premiership cup for Collingwood at the MCG.
The Magpies ball magnet was relentless with 24 touches, 11 marks and kicked 10 points for the Australian team, including the three-pointer that tied the scores late in the match.
Brad Green responded from a quiet opening match with four overs in a busy performance, including the match-winning three pointer with only a minute on the clock.
Bryce Gibbs was also one of Australia's best while former AFL player Colm Begley was named the best on the pitch during the two contests for the Irish.
The result also ended a memorable year for Australian coach Mick Malthouse.
The Magpies boss, who was in charge when the national team lost the previous series in 2008 in Australia, added an International Rules series triumph less than a month after his third premiership as coach.
" ... I won't name this player but a young man came up to me and he said 'that was right up there even with a premiership'.
"Well I thought you are representing your country and that means so much."
Ireland manager Anthony Tohill said his players were shattered after the defeat.
"The lads gave everything, just gave everything we were probably coming from too far back but even with that we got four up and we walked away with nothing," he said.
"I felt we were going to win the game but you have to be proud of the players.
"They exhausted themselves late in the game and they came up short."
"But that is life, that is football. Australia played some fantastic football tonight and we could not do anymore."
Australia dominated for much of the night and even when the Irish had an extra player on the pitch in the second term, it appeared to make little difference.
The tourists held an 11-point lead at half-time but failed to take their chances to bury the home side in the third term.
James Kavanagh's goal in the 14th minute lifted the home crowd but the Irish still had a deficit of 10 points heading into the final term.
With deafening chants of 'Ireland, Ireland' from the crowd, the home side hit the lead at the halfway mark and minutes later Michael Murphy stretched the lead to four points.
Australia responded with Swan levelling the scores at 52-52 before Green kicked the winning three pointer before a dramatic finish.
With just seconds to go, it looked like a Fletcher fumble could cost Australia the game but he managed to put his body in the way of Goulding's shot.
If the series had been locked at 1-1, the winner would have been decided on for and against.
The 2011 International Rules series will be held in Australia with matches on October 21 and 28.
The series is then due for a break in 2012 before recommencing in 2013 in Ireland and 2014 in Australia.
