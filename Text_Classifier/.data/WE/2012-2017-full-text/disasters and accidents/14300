Utah Flash Flood Kills 12, Search on for 1 Missing
"Unbeknownst to them, a flash flood had developed up in the canyon and it came rushing down, and it actually came around behind the vehicles and engulfed the vehicles," the mayor said. "I've lived here all my life, and I've never seen anything like this," he said.
Three children were found alive. The names of those killed were not released Tuesday by officials.
Joseph Jessop said the victims included members of his family.
"My family and my friend's family were swept away in this flash flood. We express our sincere gratitude for the kindness and assistance in this inexpressible time of sorrow," Jessop said at an afternoon news conference.
Jessop said his family was part of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Texas in 2008 when it wasraided by the government. He said his family recently lost another home, which he blamed on religious persecution.
"We survived the FLDS raid in Texas in 2008, have been forced to find a home and have our appeals for redress unanswered," Jessop said in a statement. "But now in an instant our families are gone."
"We know God is guiding in all things, and trust in him to heal our wounded hearts at this time." Jessop said.
