France carnival explosion injures many
At least 18 people were injured when a bonfire exploded at a carnival held in northern France.
The blast occurred at the end of the Yellow Carnaval in Villepinte, north-east of Paris, on Saturday afternoon.
Video posted on social media showed the bonfire blowing up seconds after being ignited, sending debris flying.
A mother and her child are among those seriously injured and the town's mayor was also hurt, Le Parisien newspaper reported.
Agence France-Presse said an initial investigation had been opened by prosecutors, but the cause of the explosion was not yet known.
A police source told the BFM news network that the explosion may have been caused by the petrol used to help start the fire.
