Egypt: Hosni Mubarak fined for cutting internet
Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been fined $34m (Â£20m) for cutting off communications services during the uprising that ousted him.
The fine of 200m Egyptian pounds is the first clear ruling against Mr Mubarak since he left office in February. Two other senior officials were also fined.
The 83-year-old is currently under arrest in hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh after being taken ill in detention.
He has been charged over the deaths of anti-government protesters.
Mr Mubarak is also being questioned over charges that he and his family made huge profits during the three decades he spent as Egyptian president.
More than 20 Mubarak-era ministers and businessmen linked to the regime have been detained since his departure.
Last week, former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly was sentenced to 12 years in jail on charges of money-laundering and profiteering.
On Saturday, he was also fined over the disruption to telephone and internet services during the Egyptian revolution, along with Mr Mubarak and his former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif.
Adly also faces separate charges of ordering troops to fire on demonstrators. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr Mubarak and his sons Alaa and Gamal have been charged with "premeditated murder" of some participants in the protests, the country's state news agency reported.
