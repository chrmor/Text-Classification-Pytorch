Samantha Cameron gives birth to baby girl
Downing Street said both the baby, born weighing 6lb 1oz, and the Prime Minister's wife were ''doing very well''.
''The Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron are delighted to announce the birth of their fourth child, a baby girl,'' a spokesman said.
''Both the baby – who was born weighing 6lb 1oz – and Mrs Cameron are doing very well.
''The PM and Mrs Cameron would like to thank the doctors and nurses at the hospital for their help and kindness.''
The couple had been enjoying a 'staycation' holiday in Cornwall, with children Nancy, 6, and Arthur Elwen, 4 when Mrs Cameron went into labour.
Delivered at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, the baby, was a month early.
No name has yet been announced.
The news that Mrs Cameron was pregnant broke in March, just ahead of the General Election campaign and a year after the death of their six-year-old son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy.
In May 2000, Leo Blair became the first child to be born to a serving prime minister.
