Johannesburg - Rescuers are still trying to retrieve a body trapped under the collapsed temporary bridge along the M1 highway in Sandton.
News24 reporter on the scene, Lizeka Tandwa, said City of Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi confirmed that rescuers were attempting to retrieve the body from the debris.
But the precarious operation is likely to be complicated as rescuers figure out the best way to go about it.
Meanwhile Uber in Johannesburg, in partnership with the City of Johannesburg, said it would offer free rides to and from Gauteng stations until 21:00 in light of the incident.
Paramedics confirmed earlier that two people were dead and 23 were injured following the collapse.
Murray & Roberts, the company responsible for the construction, said it was probing the incident.
Company spokesperson Ed Jardim said they did not immediately have all the details of the incident, but they had sent people to the scene.
