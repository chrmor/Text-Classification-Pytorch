Operation KKK, an Anonymous-led effort to shut down the Ku Klux Klan, has begun early. The hacktivist collective, who had promised to reveal the identities of up to 1,000 KKK members on the first anniversary of the Ferguson protests, has published dozens of phone numbers and email addresses belonging to members of the Ku Klux Klan.
Tillis, who is listed as a member of the United Northern and Southern Knights of the KKK in Thornton, was North Carolina’s Speaker of the House before being elected to the US Senate in 2014. Cornyn, who Anonymous claims is affiliated with the United White Knights of the KKK, is the current Majority Whip, making him one of the most powerful members of the US Senate. Coats is Indiana’s senior US Senator, and is listed as a member of the United Northern and Southern Knights of the KKK. Isakson, listed as a member of the Original Knight Riders of the KKK, serves as Georgia’s senior US Senator.
In its statement addressed to the members of the KKK, Anonymous warned:
Today we have shut down servers, gotten personal information on members of the KKK, and infiltrated your twitters and websites. And this is just the beginning. On November the 4th we will be having a twitter storm, spreading awareness about the operation. And on the 5th we shall release more than 1000 Ku Klux Klan members Names and websites, new and old.
This is what Anonymous promised last week:
The group has vowed to reveal the full identities of up to 1,000 members of the KKK on November 5 to coincide with the Million Mask March.
