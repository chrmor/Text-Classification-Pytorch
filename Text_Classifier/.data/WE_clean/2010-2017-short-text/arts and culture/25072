Britain's Information Commissioner's Office orders Google, Inc. to remove, from its search engines, links to news stories about Google's implementation of a "right to be forgotten" request, that include identifying information about a decade-old shoplifting conviction, which the Information Commission's Office considers as being no longer relevant. The order applies only in the United Kingdom. (Irish Examiner)
