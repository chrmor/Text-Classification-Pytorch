Questions and Answers on the New Study Linking Cellphones and Cancer in Rats
Do cellphones cause cancer? Most health authorities do not think so, but a new federal study could reignite the controversy over this issue.
The preliminary study, released Friday, found that radiation from cellphones appears to have increased the risks that male rats developed tumors in their brains and hearts. But there are many caveats and some experts are debunking the study.
Who conducted the study? Are they credible?
The study is from the National Toxicology Program, an interagency group in the Department of Health and Human Services whose job it is to assess the possible risks of chemicals.
How was the study done?
Rats lived in special chambers where they were exposed to different levels of radiation of the type emitted by cellphones for nine hours a day, every day. The exposure started before they were born and continued until they were about 2 years old.
