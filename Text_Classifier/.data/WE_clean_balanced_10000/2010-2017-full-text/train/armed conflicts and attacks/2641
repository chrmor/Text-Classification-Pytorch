Priest Killed in ISIS-Linked Hostage Drama at French Church
An elderly priest was "assassinated" as he conducted Mass at a church in France early Tuesday when two knife-wielding attackers linked to ISIS took several nuns and worshippers hostage.
The siege ended when the hostage-takers were "neutralized" at the church in the town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, police said. Another hostage was critically injured.
The victim was named by Archbishop of Rouen Dominique Lebrun as Rev. Jacques Hamel, 86. "I cry out to God," Lebrun said in a statement.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he was horrified by the "barbaric" attack.
The killing is being investigated by anti-terrorism police, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters. "A person was assassinated and another seriously injured," he said.
French authorities said the hostage-taking began at 9:25 a.m., when the attackers barged into morning Mass, taking six people — three nuns, a priest and a couple — hostage.
Police SWAT teams arrived and tried to negotiate with the captors. They attempted to storm the church, but the assailants used three hostages as a "curtain" in front of the door, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said.
Then the door swung open, and the three hostages ran out, Molins said. The two attackers followed, shouting "Allahu Akbar," and were "neutralized" by police. Officials did not give details on exactly how the police killed the assailants.
