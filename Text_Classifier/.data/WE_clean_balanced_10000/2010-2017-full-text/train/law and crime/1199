UAE president's brother acquitted of attack on businessman
The failure to convict Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan will be a blow to the country's attempts to improve the image of its legal system.
A court in Al Ain, second city of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, acquitted the sheikh of rape, endangering a life and causing bodily harm against the after his lawyer claimed he had been drugged at the time of the incident and had no recollection of it.
Sheikh Issa is a half-brother of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, hereditary ruler of Abu Dhabi who is also head of the federal UAE state.
Sheikh Issa is a businessman with no government role, but there was an international outcry from human rights groups when the video surfaced, particularly as the authorities at first appeared to brush it off.
It purported to show the sheikh, a security guard and others lashing Mohammed Shapour's buttocks with a plank with nails in. They raped him with an electric baton, poured fuel on his genitals and set light to them.
Sheikh Issa then appeared to drive over him in his SUV.
The video was released in the United States by Bassam Nabulsi, a Lebanese-American businessman who is involved in court proceedings there against Sheikh Issa.
Mr Nabulsi and his brother Ghassan were convicted in absentia of drugging the sheikh and blackmailing him, and sentenced to five years' jail. Three other defendants were also convicted of various charges.
Sheikh Issa's laywer said his client had been taking prescription drugs, which caused anger, suicidal feelings and violence, as well as memory loss.
He also said the Nabulsi brothers had drugged the sheikh and set up the incident with a view to using it for blackmail.
