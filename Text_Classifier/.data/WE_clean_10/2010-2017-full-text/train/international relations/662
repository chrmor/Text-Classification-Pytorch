Breakings news and perspectives from around the globe
Corruption appears to be on the rise worldwide, according to the latest report released by Transparency International.
The increase was most evident in Europe, where 73 percent of people polled believed corruption had risen over the last three years. North America wasn't far behind - 67 percent of people there thought corruption was now more widespread.
The findings are outlined in Transparency International's (TI) 2010 Global Corruption Barometer, a public opinion survey released by the Berlin-based organization on Thursday to coincide with the United Nations' International Anti-Corruption Day.
Six out of 10 people surveyed around the world said corruption had increased in the last three years, with one in four people reporting that they had paid bribes in the last year.
EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstroem, said in an interview with German daily Die Welt that Europe would increase its efforts to combat corruption.
"The measures taken so far by the EU have not yet led to any conclusive results," she said.
The report also noted that bribery and corruption continues to disproportionally affect the poor and the young, with lower income earners twice as likely to pay bribes for basic services like utilities, education and medical services.
"Better whistle-blower protection and greater access to information are crucial," said Labelle. "Public engagement in the fight against corruption will force those in authority to act, and will give people further courage to speak out and stand up for a cleaner, more transparent world."
The annual report, now in its seventh year, surveyed more than 91,000 people in 86 countries, including for the first time China, Bangladesh and the Palestinian territories. Polling, mostly by the Gallup Institute, was carried out between June 1 and September 30.
