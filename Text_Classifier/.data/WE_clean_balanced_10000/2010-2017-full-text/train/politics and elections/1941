Margaret Thatcher's funeral -Tuesday 16 April
• Lady Thatcher's coffin has arrived at a crematorium in Mortlake for a private cremation aftera ceremonial funeral in London that saw thousands of people line the streets to pay tribute. More than 2,000 people attended the service in St Paul's Cathedral. Although David Cameron described it as having elements of a state funeral, Conservatives and US Republicans were predominant among the political guests. Few Labour politicians attended, and no one senior from President Obama's administration. At one point George Osborne was seen crying, and he later tweeted that it had been an "almost overwhelming day". But the most memorable moment may have been the reading from Amanda Thatcher, 19, Thatcher's granddaughter. Britons know almost nothing about her, but she delivered her reading with great poise and confidence, provoking inevitable comparisons with what her grandmother may have been like at that age.
• Many people have marked the funeral with protests or celebrations. In London the protesters were clearly vastly outnumbered by the Thatcher supporters along the funeral route, although colleagues who were on the streets think the protests were more substantial than some of the broadcast reports suggests. But outside London, particularly in mining areas and in the north of England, people have used the funeral as a reason for holding a party. The Press Association has reported from several of these events, including one where an effigy of Thatcher was burnt, but it is quite possible that many more are happening beyond the gaze on the national media. There seems to be a vast gulf between the way Thatcher is perceived in London and the south of England (where the national newspapers and broadcasters are based) and how she is perceived in the industrial north. Nigel Bunyan's report from Knowlsey illustrates this vividly. There have also been celebrations in Derry in Northern Ireland which have been followed by youths throwing petrol bombs.
• David Cameron has sought to elevate Thatcher above party politics by saying: "We're all Thatcherites now." This is what he told the Today programme.
He also claimed that Thatcher was a Tory moderniser.
• Richard Chartres, the bishop of London, has insisted that Thatcher did believe in society. In his address during the funeral service, he said the funeral was not a time for political debate. But he also sought to rebut one of the most controversial claims about Thatcher, that she did not believe in society.
Here's the full "no such thing as society" quote.Thatcher definitely said this, but, as is clear from the context, she was not advocating brash, you're-on-your-own individualism. She made it clear she did think people have obligations to each other.
That's all from Paul and me. Thanks for the comments. AS
