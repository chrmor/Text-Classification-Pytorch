Jersey stabbings: Damian Rzeszowski sentenced to 30 years
A man who killed six people, including his wife and children, in Jersey has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by Jersey's Royal Court.
Damian Rzeszowski, 32, stabbed Izabela Rzeszowska, 30, Kinga, five, and Kacper, two, in St Helier on 14 August last year.
He also killed his father-in-law, his wife's friend and her daughter.
After five hours of legal arguments earlier, the Jurats took two hours to consider their verdict.
Rzeszowski was sentenced to 30 years for each victim, the sentences to run concurrently in a UK prison.
Judge Sir Michael Birt said: "The horror and brutality of these killings is hard to believe.
"Within a quarter of an hour or so six people had their lives cruelly cut short at the hands of this defendant."
Earlier in court, the prosecution called for a 30-year sentence for Rzeszowski.
He had been cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.
As well as his wife and children, Rzeszowski also killed Marek Garstka, 56, Marta De La Haye, 34, and Julia De La Haye, aged five after a summer barbecue at his St Helier home.
During the trial in August, the court heard that Rzeszowski's marriage had been under strain after his wife confessed to a two-month affair.
It also heard he had threatened to commit suicide and had been suffering moderate to severe depression, which had caused an onset of psychotic symptoms.
Rzeszowski and Izabela Rzeszowska moved to Jersey from Poland in 2004 and built a new life on the island.
They married there in 2005 and had two children, Kinga and Kacper.
A Jersey Police spokesman said: "Today's sentencing is the conclusion to proceedings following the tragic events of August last year here in Jersey.
"No sentence will ever bring back the loved ones who tragically lost their lives on that Sunday afternoon.
"Our thoughts and support remain with the families who now continue to try and rebuild their lives."
