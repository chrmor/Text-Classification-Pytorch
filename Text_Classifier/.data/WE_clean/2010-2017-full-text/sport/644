Shooting in Venezuela suspends baseball
The Australian women's baseball team was caught up in a shooting incident that forced the suspension of the world championship in Caracas on Friday.
The Australian team was at the venue when a Hong Kong player was hit in the leg by a stray bullet during a match against the Netherlands in a stadium at the Fort Tiuna military base.
Venezuelan Vice-President Elias Jaua told state television the player was not seriously injured but that the day's games had been suspended while police investigated the incident.
It wasn't clear from where the bullet was fired.
Gun violence is common in the hillside slums near the base and is a serious problem in many areas of Venezuela, which is among the most violent countries in Latin America.
The Australian Baseball Federation on Saturday released a statement confirming the Australian team was at the facility preparing for their game - which was scheduled to commence on the same field after the Hong Kong match - when the shooting occurred.
