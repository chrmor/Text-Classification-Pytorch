Jordan probe as football stampede and clash injures 250
An investigation has been launched in Jordan after violence at a football match left 250 people injured.
Police said some fans were hit by stones as they tried to leave the Qawasmeh stadium in the capital, Amman, sparking a stampede that caused a metal rail to collapse.
The match was between fierce rivals al-Wehdat and al-Feisali.
Supporters of the latter mainly come from Bedouin clans, while the former is backed by Palestinian refugees.
Most of those hurt were injured when the metal fence separating them from the playing field collapsed.
Dozens of police were among the injured.
Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi said: "The government will monitor the results of the investigation and any legal action will be taken against those who broke the law and caused these unfortunate events."
One witness told Agence France-Presse news agency that police "intervened violently when some people threw stones at the stadium. They started to beat people left and right. Also some of the angry fans threw stones at cars and shops outside the stadium".
Some Jordanians feel Palestinian refugees have little allegiance to the nation.
Last year, Feisali fans chanted slogans attacking Queen Rania, who is of Palestinian origin.
Many refugees complain they are barred from leading positions in the security forces and government.
