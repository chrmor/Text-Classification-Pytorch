Gunmen attack religious gathering in Pakistani port city, killing 8
Officials say gunmen attacked an Islamic religious gathering in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi, killing eight people.
Aftab Chanur, an official at the hospital where the dead and wounded were taken, gave the death toll and also said eight people were wounded in the Sunday night attack.
A police official, Javed Odho, said the gunmen first threw grenades at the building where a Sufi cleric was receiving his followers, and then opened fire.
Pakistan is 95 percent Muslim, and the majority practice Sufi-influenced Islam.
But their shrines and followers have come under attack in Pakistan by Sunni Muslim militants who don't consider them to be true Muslims.
