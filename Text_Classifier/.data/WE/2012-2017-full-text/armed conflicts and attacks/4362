6 die in Syria car bombing; gunman slays state journalist
BEIRUT — A car bomb exploded in eastern Damascus on Saturday, an insurgent spokeswoman said, and the Syrian government reported that a gunman killed a state television journalist in the capital.
The car bomb exploded in the capital's Kaboun area and left six people dead and 10 wounded, an opposition spokeswoman in Damascus identified as Lena Shami said by Skype.
There was no way to independently confirm the death toll.
The official Syria Arab News Agency also reported the bombing, blaming terrorists, the government's usual description of rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar Assad. Shami blamed  the bombing on the government, which she said was targeting the area's Sunni residents. Sunnis make up a majority of the nation's population and also of the rebellion.
Meanwhile, a Syrian state television cameraman was slain outside his home in Damascus, SANA reported.
Haidar Smoudi was the ninth state-employed journalist killed by "armed terrorist groups," the news agency said. There was no claim of responsibility in the shooting, but anti-government groups have been suspected of carrying out attacks on state-employed journalists.
