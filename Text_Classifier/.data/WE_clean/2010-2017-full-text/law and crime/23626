US police officers arrested over fatal shooting of boy
The head of Louisiana's state police has announced that two law enforcement officers have been arrested over the fatal shooting of a six-year-old boy and the wounding of his father earlier this week.
Colonel Mike Edmonson said in a news conference on Friday that the two officers were being booked on charges of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder over Tuesday's shooting in Marksville.
Edmonson identified the two officers as Norris Greenhouse Jr and Derrick Stafford.
State police have been investigating the death of Jeremy Mardis, who was in a vehicle with his father when pursuing officers opened fire.
Edmonson gave few details of what happened but said the investigation was ongoing. Two other officers were involved in the incident.
"He didn't deserve to die like that, and that's what's important," Edmonson said at a news conference.
Citing camera footage of the incident, he said: "I can tell you, it is the most disturbing thing I've seen, and I'll leave it like that."
