Storms to batter flood-hit Britain
LARGE swathes of England and Wales are on flood alert as yet another storm with winds of up to 112km/h arrives to batter Britain.
The crisis-hit Somerset Levels where many residents have already been forced from their homes after weeks of heavy rain remain at the highest risk of continued flooding.
The Environment Agency (EA) also highlighted the coastline of Devon and Dorset as being at "significant risk" of new flooding as high tides and winds arrive.
There are more than 300 low-level flood alerts and nearly 200 medium-risk flood warnings in place across Wales and southern and central England as north as Hull.
The storm will move north-eastwards bringing with it winds of up to 112km/h and heavy showers throughout Saturday, weather forecasters MeteoGroup said.
The continued storms come after Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to do everything he could to help the flood-stricken communities of the Somerset Levels but warned solutions would take some time.
Mr Cameron travelled to the Somerset Levels via helicopter - meaning he was able to view the region's 168 square kilometres of submerged land first-hand.
"The scale of it here in Somerset is immense when you think of how many square miles are under water.
"Clearly people here have faced a very tough time and continue to face a tough time and that's why we have got to do everything we can to help."
More support from the emergency services, more pumps and more money will be available to help Somerset, he promised residents.
"Everything that can be done will be done and I'll make sure that happens," he added.
Around 5000 properties have been affected by flooding across the country, including 40 in Somerset.
