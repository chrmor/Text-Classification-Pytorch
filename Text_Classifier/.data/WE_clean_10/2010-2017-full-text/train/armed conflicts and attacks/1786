Turkey protests: second fatality reported as widespread civil unrest continues
"Abdullah Comert was seriously wounded ... after gunfire from an unidentified person," the NTV television station said, quoting a statement from the local governor's office in the Hatay province.
He died in hospital, the private station added.
With the latest casualty, the death toll rose to at least two in what has become a wave of protests against the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in cities across the country.
Hasan Akgol, a main opposition party lawmaker, said Comert was a member of the youth branch of the Republican People's Party (CHP).
Police have launched an investigation into the incident.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing down some of the fiercest protests in his decade-long rule.
His critics denounce what they say is his authoritarian approach to government, accusing him of trying to impose conservative Islamic reforms on secular Turkey.
The unrest, which began on Friday after police cracked down on a demonstration in Istanbul, quickly blew up into anti-government protests across the country.
The country is now posed for a two-day strike by public sector workers in support of the protesters.
Kesk trade union, a left-wing organisation of some 240,000 members, has accused the government of enacting "state terror."
Government offices, universities and schools are all expected to be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
"The state terror implemented against entirely peaceful protests is continuing in a way that threatens civilians' life safety," said Kesk in an official statement.
