SYDNEY (MarketWatch) -- Singapore's economy contracted at a sharper-than-expected rate in the second quarter, as manufacturing output slowed and service-sector growth eased, the government said Thursday. Gross domestic product for the three months to June 30 fell 7.8% on a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis, compared to a revised 27.2% increase in the first quarter, reports said, citing preliminary data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a contraction of 0.8%. Compared to the year-earlier period, Singapore's second-quarter GDP increased by 0.5%, reports said.
