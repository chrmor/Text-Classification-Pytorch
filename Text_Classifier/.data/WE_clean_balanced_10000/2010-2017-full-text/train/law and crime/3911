3 airplanes flying into Dallas airport hit by laser, FAA says
Three airplanes flying into a Dallas airport were hit by a laser coming from the same direction Wednesday night, according to the FAA.
Lynn Lunsford, an FAA spokeswoman, said a Southwest Airlines 737, a Virgin America A319 and a private plane were all struck between 7:30 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. CST as they were flying between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. All of the planes were about to land at Love Field.
The FAA and Dallas police are investigating the incident. KXAS-TV said a police helicopter was searching for the source of the laser, but it wasn’t immediately discovered.
It’s a federal crime to interfere with the operation of a jet and the offense is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000. The FBI has previously said it will pay up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest of someone who aimed a laser at a plane.
The Dallas Morning News reports Austin Lawrence Siferd, 23, was jailed in July after he pointed a green laser at seven different jets.
