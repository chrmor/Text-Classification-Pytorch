Ecuador issues warrant for ex-president
ECUADOR'S highest court has issued an international arrest warrant for a former president who settled in the United States more than a decade ago after being ousted in a popular revolt.
Judge Ximena Vintimilla of the National Court of Justice on Wednesday asked Interpol to arrest former president Jamil Mahuad on charges of embezzlement.
The judge also ordered the seizure of all of Mahuad's assets in Ecuador.
Mahuad was deposed in January 2000 amid a revolt by indigenous people angry over deeply entrenched poverty and marginalisation.
The embezzlement allegations against him stem from his decision to freeze bank deposits in Ecuador during a financial crisis that ultimately led to Ecuador's shifting to a dollar-based economy in March 2000.
After his ouster Mahuad fled to the United States and has ruled out returning home.
