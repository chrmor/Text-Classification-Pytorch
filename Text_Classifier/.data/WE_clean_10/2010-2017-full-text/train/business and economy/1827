Caesars' unit to file for bankruptcy Thursday in Chicago
Jan 14 (Reuters) - Caesars Entertainment Corp’s operating unit will file for bankruptcy on Thursday in Chicago, according to a Wednesday court filing by the largest U.S. casino company.
The bankruptcy filing has been anticipated since last month, although not the court and timing. Creditors opposed to the company’s $10 billion debt-cutting proposal filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the operating unit on Monday in Wilmington, Delaware.
