The Buggles reunite for one night only
One-hit wonders known for Video Killed the Radio Star to re-form for first – and last – ever full gig
The Buggles, the English band that launched MTV with their one and only hit, are reuniting. Thirty-one years after Video Killed the Radio Star signalled the dawn of music television, the group will play their "first ever full live gig" in London next month.
Trevor Horn announced his group's reunion on his website. The original Buggles trio – consisting of Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley – will come together for just one night, performing their debut album at an unnamed west London venue. The gig is a fundraiser for the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability.
Buoyed by its electro-pop pep and a silly, catchy chorus, Video Killed the Radio Star went to No 1 in 16 countries. As the first video to air on MTV in 1981, it has also become a fixture of pub quizzes from LA to London. But despite these victories, the Buggles have also come to epitomise the one-hit wonder. Woolley, who was the principal songwriter on Radio Star, left the band not long after its release, and subsequent collaborations between Horn and Downes failed to gain much traction. The Buggles dissolved into the prog band Yes, to mixed success, and the group's second and last album was essentially the work of Horn on his own.
The Buggles were pure flash-in-the-pan pop. The founding lineup had just one hit, never toured, and Woolley didn't even play on most of their debut. So it's pleasant to have them back after all these years, playing 1979's The Age of Plastic. Apart from a one-song reunion in 2004, this is essentially the band's live debut.
Last year, Horn brought his old band back into the spotlight, producing Robbie Williams's album Reality Killed the Video Star and duetting on a Buggles cover at the 2009 Electric Proms.
The Buggles reunion will take place on 28 September. Visit Trevor Horn's site to register for updates on tickets and the concert location.
