Wole Soyinka launches new Nigeria party
Lagos, Nigeria Nobel literature laureate and longtime activist Wole Soyinka launched a new political party in Nigeria today ahead of presidential elections set for early next year The Democratic Front for a People’s Federation says it aims to reduce corruption and improve conditions in health and education.
Soyinka, whose politically engaged plays and books have earned him wide acclaim, was elected chairman of the party, though it was unclear whether he would be a candidate for any office in next year’s ballot.
Nigeria will hold presidential, state and legislative elections early next year, but the dates are still being debated. Soyinka became Africa’s first Nobel laureate in literature when he won the prize in 1986.
His book “The Man Died” recounts his time in jail after being imprisoned following his attempt to broker talks during Nigeria’s 1967-1970 civil war.AFP
