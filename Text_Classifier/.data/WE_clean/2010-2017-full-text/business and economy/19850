Italian workers protest against labour reforms as unemployment reaches record levels
Thousands of Italians have taken to the streets as part of a general strike aimed at the government's labour law reforms.
The protests have disrupted transport across Italy, with rallies held in more than 50 cities, including the capital Rome.
In Turin and Milan scuffles broke out between the police and some of the protesters.
Italy's unemployment is currently at record levels and youth jobless rates have reached 40 per cent.
The rallies targeted the Jobs Act which loosens restrictions on firing employees when companies face a downturn and weakens unlawful dismissal rights.
One protester said the burden of the reforms was being placed unfairly on workers.
"We want jobs and you can't create jobs by cutting the rights of the workers," the protester said.
"We want to reclaim our rights. We want democracy, which they are stealing, together with the dignity of the Italian people and the workers."
In recent years, a series of Italian governments have tried and failed to reform the country's employment laws.
The country's economy has remained in recession.
Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said the planned reforms were essential for the government to lift the country's economy out of years of stagnation.
"We are taking part in this general strike against the government because there are no jobs in the publishing sector which we represent," the protester said.
"In the last four years 50 per cent of the positions in the sector have been lost and unfortunately these 50 per cent often end up doing 'black work' and therefore we are asking for legality and jobs."
