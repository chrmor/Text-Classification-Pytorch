20 prisoners killed in Yemen air strikes
Sanaa, Oct 12 (IANS) At least 20 prisoners were killed when warplanes of the Saudi-led coalition bombed a prison in Yemen's al-Bayda province on Sunday, medical sources and witnesses said.
The prison which held more than 100 prisoners was controlled by the Shia Houthi group, the sources said, adding that up to 30 others were wounded in the air raids, Xinhua reported.
The coalition warplanes also targeted several military posts on Sunday run by the Houthis and their allied forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in the capital Sanaa.
The Saudi-led coalition has carried out military operations, including air strikes on a daily basis, against the Houthis since late March in Yemen in an effort to restore the authority of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi who fled to the Saudi capital of Riyadh to take refuge.
Pro-government forces have retaken several southern provinces in recent months, however, the Houthis still controls the northern part of the country, including Sanaa.
The United Nations has called for peace talks to end the war, saying "there is no military solution to the conflict in Yemen", as more than 4,900 people have been killed in ground battles and air strikes, half of them civilians.
