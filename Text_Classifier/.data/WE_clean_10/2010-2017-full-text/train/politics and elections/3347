Dempsey's office vandalised
Gardaí are investigating an attack on the Minster for Transport Noel Dempsey’s constituency office in Trim, Co Meath last night.
The word "tratiors" (sic) was sprayed in large letters with red paint on the outside of the building and three windows were smashed.
A Department of Transport spokeswoman described the incident as “an act of mindless vandalism”.
A Garda spokesman said the attack happened sometime between 2.30am and 7.30am and nobody was in the building at the time.
The office is one of a number the Minister has in the constituency.
