A plaque will be placed at the site of the torpedoed wartime hospital ship, the Centaur, this week.
It was sunk by a Japanese submarine off south-east Queensland in 1943, killing 268 people.
The wreck was found on the ocean floor last month and a bronze plaque has been created to place beside it.
Project director David Mearns says it could be lowered today if he and his crew find a way to ensure it will not disappear into the seabed.
He says they have already experimented with a piece of metal.
"It buried itself quite deeply into the mud and if we did that with the plaque ... it would obscure half of the writing and the most important part, which is the memorial that the Centaur Association wanted to make to their relatives who were lost," he said.
The Caloundra RSL Centaur Committee says planning is underway for two memorial services to honour those who died onboard the ship.
Erica Costigan says the Centaur Taskforce is yet to set the dates for the services.
"There will be a shipboard ceremony over the site for families," she said.
"As well as that, there will be a land-based memorial service in Brisbane for families - perhaps some aren't able to or wish to go on the ship - for families, national and state dignitaries, politicians, organisations and the general public."
