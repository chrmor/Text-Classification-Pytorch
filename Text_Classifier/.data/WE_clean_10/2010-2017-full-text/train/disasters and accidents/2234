China's worst floods to weigh on food prices
By Kim Young-gyo HONG KONG, June 22 (Yonhap) -- China's worst floods in decades will likely add upward pressure to rising food prices, further fueling already high inflation in the world's No. 2 economy, government officials said Wednesday. China's consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier to a 34-month high due to soaring food costs, partly driven by unfavorable weather conditions across the country. China's inflation gauge grew more than 5 percent for the third straight month, higher than the government's annual target of 4 percent.
