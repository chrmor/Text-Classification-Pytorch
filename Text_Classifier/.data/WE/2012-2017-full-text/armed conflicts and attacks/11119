Air strikes kill 18 militants in Khyber district
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's military said on Sunday it had killed 18 militants in air attacks in tribal district near the Afghan border.
The strikes took place Saturday night in Khyber district, where the Taliban and other banned militant group have taken refuge, the military said in a statement.
It said a huge cache of arms and ammunition was also destroyed.
In June the army began an offensive against militant hideouts in the North Waziristan tribal agency after a bloody raid on Karachi Airport ended faltering peace talks between the government and the Taliban.
Pakistan's army says it has killed more than a thousand militants and lost 86 soldiers since the start of the operation.
