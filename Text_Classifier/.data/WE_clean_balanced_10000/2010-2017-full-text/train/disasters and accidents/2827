14 injured after TTC buses collide
Fourteen people were taken to hospital with minor injuries after two TTC buses collided head-on at Wilson Subway Station, police said.
Everyone has minor, non-life-threatening injuries, said Kim McKinnon, spokesperson for Toronto EMS.
“The patients were all walking,” she said.
The collision occurred near Wilson Ave. and Wilson Heights Blvd., north of Yorkdale Mall, on a TTC roadway, she said.
The buses were travelling in opposite directions under the subway underpass, Const. Hugh Smith said.
The westbound bus was coming down the ramp at 20 km/h when it straddled the centre line, hitting the eastbound bus, which was pulling out of the subway station.
The cause of the accident doesn’t appear to be speed but a wide turn taken by the westbound bus, Smith said.
Police from 32 Division responded to the scene at 11:18 a.m. Traffic Services is now in charge.
Toronto Fire was also on scene.
Subway service is running, although there are some other delays, said Danny Nicholson, TTC spokesperson.
