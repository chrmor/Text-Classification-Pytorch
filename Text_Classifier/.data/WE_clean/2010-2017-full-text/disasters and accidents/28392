Stampede Kills at Least 24 at Hindu Ceremony in India
LUCKNOW, India — At least 24 people were killed and 20 others were injured in a stampede that occurred Saturday as worshipers were crossing a crowded bridge to reach a Hindu religious ceremony in northern India, the police said.
The stampede took place on the outskirts of Varanasi, a city in Uttar Pradesh, a state known for its temples. Organizers were expecting 3,000 people at the ceremony, but more than 70,000 crowded into the ashram of a local Hindu leader on a bank of the Ganges River, a police officer, S. K. Bhagat, said.
“We were not prepared for such a large crowd,” said Raj Bahadur, a spokesman for the organizers.
The stampede happened as the police started turning people back from the overcrowded bridge, Mr. Bahadur said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. That set off a rumor that the bridge had collapsed, and people started running for safety, he said.
Nineteen people were killed at the scene, and five others died at a hospital, said Daljit Chaudhary, another police officer. Four of the 20 injured people were still in serious condition, he said.
