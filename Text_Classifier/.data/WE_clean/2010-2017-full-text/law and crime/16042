West Point staff member accused of spying on female cadets
A West Point Military Academy staff member has been accused of planting hidden cameras in the shower and locker room facilities of female cadets, U.S. military and Pentagon officials told NBC News.
Sgt. 1st Class Michael McClendon has been relieved of his duties at West Point. McClendon was charged with four counts of indecent acts, dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment and violations of good order and discipline. He has been transferred to Fort Drum in upstate New York.
McClendon, a decorated combat veteran of the war in Iraq, was a staff advisor responsible for the health, welfare and discipline of 125 cadets, defense officials said.
He received the Bronze Star and combat action badge during his combat tour in Iraq.
The story was first reported by the New York Times.
Separately, the Army on Tuesday said Brigadier General Bryan T. Roberts, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Training Center and Fort Jackson, was being investigated for adultery and for being involved in a physical altercation. Roberts was suspended from his duties.
A rash of recent incidents — including an annual report showing increased sex assaults in the military, and two separate cases of men tasked with stemming sexual assault being charged with sexual assault — has critics, lawmakers, and even President Barack Obama focused on the problem.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week ordered all branches to “retrain, recredential and rescreen all sexual assault prevention and response personnel and military recruiters.”
