Six people have died and thousands been left homeless in the Philippines after two fires struck Manila on Christmas Day, sparking riots as a slum went up in flames.
The casualties, all from one family, were trapped inside their two-storey flat after fire razed a row of old apartments in northern Manila at dawn.
"We retrieved six casualties already but, this six we could not determine who is this, because all bodies are burnt," bureau of fire senior superintendent, Agarson Omar, said.
Another victim is still missing, local media said.
Suspected arsonists set off a second blaze at a sprawling shantytown across the city, sparking rioting that left one man dead and two others arrested, Manila fire marshal, Santiago Laguna, said.
"They (residents) started grabbing hoses from our firefighters, who could not do anything as they feared for their own safety," he said.
A man was beaten up and later died from his injuries in the melee as the blaze consumed the shantytown in the San Juan district, he added.
"They mistook him for a fireman," he said of the victim, adding two suspected rioters were also arrested.
Mr Laguna said residents were apparently infuriated by the delayed arrival of firefighters and took it upon themselves to grab fire hoses to aim at their blazing houses.
However he said the residents were themselves to blame.
"Our fire trucks had difficulty entering the narrow streets that were blocked by parked cars and carts," he said.
"Our firefighters had to drag the hoses into the alleys, where they were attacked."
The shantytown blaze left some 2,000 families homeless, he said, a figure that equates to at least 8,000 people.
Mr Laguna said the cause of the apartment blaze was under investigation, though he added electrical circuits had probably overloaded from increased use during Christmas Eve parties across the metropolis of 14 million people.
