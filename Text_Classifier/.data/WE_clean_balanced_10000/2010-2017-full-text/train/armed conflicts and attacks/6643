No injuries in Argentina bomb blast
(CNN) -- A bomb exploded at the Greek Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, early Thursday, the state-run Telam news agency reported, citing federal police. No one was injured in the blast.
The explosion happened about 2 a.m. (midnight Wednesday ET), police said, according to Telam. The bomb was left at the entrance to the embassy. The blast broke some windows on the embassy building and other properties on the block, the news agency reported.
The Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement the blast caused minor damage to the building's facade. Embassy personnel were not in the building at the time, it said.
"According to the initial findings of the investigation being carried out by the Argentine police, the explosion was caused by a Molotov thrown by unidentified persons," the ministry statement said. "It is to be noted that last week the Foreign Ministry instructed all its missions abroad to take increased security measures."
The blast at the Greek Embassy coincided with a bomb blast at one of the main courthouse buildings in Athens, Greece. It was not known whether the explosions were linked.
