Anger as Mubarak announces September exit
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says he will not run for a new term in office in the country's September elections, but has rejected demands that he step down immediately and leave the country, vowing to die on Egypt's soil.
His announcement in a television address on Tuesday after a dramatic day in which a quarter-million protesters in Cairo called on him to go, received an angry response from those watching in Tahrir square.
Egyptians came from all over the country to join what became the culmination of a week-long uprising aimed at removing Egypt's long-time authoritarian ruler from power.
Mubarak, 82, said he would serve out the rest of his term working to ensure a "peaceful transfer of power" and carry out amendments to rules on presidential elections.
But the half-way concession - an end to his rule months down the road - was immediately derided by protesters massed in Cairo's main downtown square.
Opposition groups had set him a Friday deadline to quit to allow a clear break with his 30-year rule.
