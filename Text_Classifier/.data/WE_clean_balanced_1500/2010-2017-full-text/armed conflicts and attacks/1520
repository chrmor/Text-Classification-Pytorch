MANILA, Philippines - One trainee of the Philippine National Police (PNP) was killed while nine others were wounded in an ambush by suspected members of the New People's Army (NPA) in the Mountain Province Friday morning.
Supt. Davy Limmong of the Cordillera Police Public Information Office (PIO) said the trainees were on their regular morning jog when they were ambushed by about 15 to 20 NPA rebels in Sitio Cabunagan, Tadian at around 5:45 a.m.
The fatality was identified as PO1 Denver Balabag.
The wounded trainees were rushed to a hospital in Bauko, Mountain Province and are now in stable condition.
Sr. Supt. Oliver Enmodias, chief of the Regional Operations and Plans Division of the Cordillera Police, said 10 trainees who were earlier reported missing have been found.
He said the trainees just hid in the area until they were sure that the attackers were already gone.
PNP-PIO chief Sr. Supt. Ruben Theodore Sindac said the trainees were only around 3 to 4 kilometers away from their camp when they were ambushed.
Manhunt operations against the communist rebels are ongoing.
Vice President Jejomar Binay has condemned the ambush, which he called a "treacherous attack."
"The PNP should intensify its pursuit operations and bring the attackers to justice," he said. -- With report from Edwin Sevidal, dzMM; ANC
