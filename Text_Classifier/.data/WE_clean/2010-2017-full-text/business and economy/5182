52,000 Mazda 6s Recalled for Fuel-Line Restriction Caused by Spiders
Mazda has a new spider model, but the marketing team probably would have trouble selling it.
The Japanese automaker announced a recall Thursday of 52,000 Mazda 6 sedans from the 2009-10 model years after finding that a spider web could cause the fuel tank to crack and leak.
In a new filing, Mazda told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that “a certain type of spider may weave a web in the evaporative canister vent line and this may cause a restriction in the line.”
Mazda says the condition can allow the pressure in the fuel tank to become “excessively negative,” putting stress on the fuel tank that “may eventually result in a crack.” Mazda said it was not aware of fuel leaks related to the problem causing any fires.
The company began investigating the issue  in early 2009, but it was not until later in the year that a second fuel leak was identified, along with a telltale spider web in the canister. Last month, Mazda decided the issue constituted a safety problem requiring a recall.
In what seems to be a reassuring move both for spiders and Mazda 6 owners, dealers will install “a spring to prohibit spider intrusion.”
