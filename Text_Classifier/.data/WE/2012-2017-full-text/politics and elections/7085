Greenpeace protesters scale UK's tallest building
Greenpeace protesters have climbed to the summit of London's Shard, which is the tallest building in western Europe.
Once at the top, two of the campaigners unfurled a giant blue flag with "Save the Arctic" written in white across it.
The charity said it was protesting against plans to drill in the Arctic by the oil company Shell, although the firm said drilling there was "not new".
