MILF forms own political party
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front’s (MILF) United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP) has formally registered as a regional political party that intends to participate in the 2016 elections.
“The creation of a political party would allow the Bangsamoro to participate in a democratic and peaceful process to advance their legitimate causes,” UBJP said in the petition it filed with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) last Wednesday.
The petition was signed by UBJP president Yasser Ebrahim.
“Political exclusion has been one of the causes of the Mindanao conflict that stymied the progress and development, not only of the Bangsamoro but also of the Philippines,” said the petition.
According to the Omnibus Election Code, “any organized group of persons seeking registration as a national or regional political party may file with the Commission a verified petition attaching its constitution and by-laws, platform or program of government and such other relevant information as may be required by the Commission.”
However, “no religious sect or a political party that seeks to achieve its goal through violence shall be entitled to accreditation as a political party” as provided by Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.
Yesterday was the deadline set by the Comelec for party-list groups and political parties to register and file their manifestation of intent to participate in the May 2016 elections. The Comelec en banc will still have to approve petitions for participation.
“If there are those who are against (a group’s participation), they should come forward,” added Jimenez.
