S. Korea seeks bilateral nuclear talks with N. Korea at key ASEAN meeting
By Kim Deok-hyun BALI, Indonesia, July 22 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's chief envoy to six-country talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program is moving to hold an informal meeting with his potential North Korean counterpart, possibly in an attempt to reopen the long-stalled talks, Seoul's diplomats here said Friday. The South's chief negotiator Wi Sung-lac is proposing holding talks with Ri Yong-ho, a veteran North Korean diplomat who is widely expected to succeed Kim Kye-gwan as the North's top envoy to the multilateral talks, on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) here, according to the diplomats.
