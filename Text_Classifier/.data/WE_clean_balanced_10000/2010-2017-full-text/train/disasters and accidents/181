Officials in Brazil are now putting the death toll from floods and mudslides at 85 and warn that the figure is likely to rise as more bodies are found.
Most of the deaths have occurred in mudslides, including one that killed six tourists driving their car.
Another on New Year's Day wiped out a luxury hotel. The death toll there is 29, but rescue teams are still finding bodies in the mud.
The weather has cleared but forecasters warn the heavy rains that have plagued three of Brazil's states will return for several more days.
Most of the mudslides have happened in areas where the mountains have been stripped bare of protective vegetation by logging.
