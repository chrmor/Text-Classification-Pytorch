Extremely well-preserved baby dinosaur fossil unearthed in Alberta
A University of Alberta paleontologist is showing off a rare dinosaur fossil that could be the most significant find of his career, three years after unearthing it at Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park, one of the richest deposits of dinosaur fossils in the world.
Philip Currie’s discovery, a near-complete skeleton of a baby Chasmosaurus belli, is the first intact fossil of its kind.
“It’s pretty exciting. It’s a super specimen and I’m very lucky to be the guy that found it,” Philip Currie told the U of A. “There’s no question this is one of the very best ones I’ve ever found.”
His dinosaur, measuring 1.5 metres in length, was probably about three years old when it died 72 million years ago. What makes Currie’s discovery so rare is that smaller dinosaurs were usually eaten or destroyed by larger animals. It’s likely the Chasmosaurus drowned and was preserved in a river bed, away from predators.
The Chasmosaurus was a horned, plant-eating dinosaur related to the more famous Triceratops and grew to about 5 metres in length. Currie’s baby skeleton is fully intact but for the arms, which may have been eroded away by a sinkhole thousands years ago.
As one of the best-preserved fossils ever found, it will provide “an opportunity to learn something about a dinosaur that has broader implications for the whole scientific community worldwide,” Currie said.
“There’s almost an infinite number of projects when you have an invaluable specimen like this.”
Currie first first stumbled on the fossil in 2010 when he noticed a piece of a skull protruding from the ground. After a full day of digging, he realized the significance of his find. It took crews another three years of painstaking work before the fossil was ready to to be unveiled.
The Chasmosaurus will be one of the stars of the U of A’s Laboratory for Vertebrate Paleontology, which houses some 50,000 specimens.
