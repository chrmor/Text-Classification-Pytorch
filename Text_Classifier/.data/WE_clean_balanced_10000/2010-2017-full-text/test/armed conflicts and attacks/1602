Syria: Government Warplanes Strike Rebel-Held District in Contested City
Syrian warplanes struck targets in a rebel-held area in the contested northern city of Aleppo on Friday, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens of others, activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, and the Aleppo Media Center said the planes had attacked three buildings that were almost completely flattened, killing at least four children. They said that many people were missing and that residents were struggling to save people trapped under concrete blocks and debris. Rebel forces and government troops have been fighting for control of Aleppo for a year.
