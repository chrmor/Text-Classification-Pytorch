Grenade attack in south Rwanda wounds 10: police
KIGALI (Reuters) - A grenade blast wounded 10 people in southern Rwanda on Tuesday, police said, the second similar attack to hit the central African country in less than a month.
The attack struck a taxi rank in the southern town of Muhanga.
“We’ve arrested two people. It was a grenade blast. We don’t know exactly how it happened,” police spokesman Theos Badege told Reuters.
Three weeks ago a grenade blast hit the capital Kigali, killing two people and wounding 16 near an open-air fruit and vegetable market.
Rwanda’s capital had been hit by a string of grenade attacks in 2010, which the government blamed on two high-ranking army officers now in exile.
One of the those, Lieutenant-General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, a former chief of staff and ambassador to India, denied the allegations at the time saying the authorities had staged the attacks and then accused him of being behind them.
The landlocked central African nation suffered at least two more grenade attacks last year.
