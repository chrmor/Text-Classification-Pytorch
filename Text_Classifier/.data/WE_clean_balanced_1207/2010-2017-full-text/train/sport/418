Boss of Croydon Athletic linked to match-fixing dies
The chairman of a south London football club whose owner was linked to the cricket match-fixing scandal has died.
David Le Cluse, 44, the chairman of Croydon Athletic Football Club, was found dead with a bullet wound on Saturday, in a garage in Sutton.
The club was probed for suspected money-laundering after its owner Mazhar Majeed was arrested over match-fixing allegations against the Pakistan team.
A statement said the club was "deeply shocked and saddened" at the death.
The club chairman's body was found with a bullet wound to the head at 1040 BST on Saturday in a garage in Park Gate Road, Sutton, close to his home in Surrey.
A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: "A 44-year-old man suffered what is believed to have been a gunshot wound to the head.
"He was pronounced dead at the scene.
"The circumstances of his death are being treated as unexplained. Inquiries are ongoing."
The statement posted on the club's website said: "Croydon Athletic are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden tragic death of their chairman, David Le Cluse, on Saturday 2 October.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with David's wife and children, and we would ask everyone to respect their privacy at this devastating time for them."
Last month the father-of-two confirmed the club was being investigated by HM Revenues and Customs following Mr Majeed's arrest, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers.
Mr Le Cluse had also admitted the club was struggling to survive.
Some members of the Pakistan cricket team were accused of match fixing during their tour of England.
