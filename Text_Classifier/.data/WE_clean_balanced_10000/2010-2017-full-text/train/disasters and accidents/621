Toll hits 26 in central China's coal mine blast
MIANCHI, Henan - The death toll in a gas explosion in a coal mine shaft has risen to 26 in Central China's Henan province, local rescue headquarters said Wednesday.
A total of 46 miners were working underground when the gas blast occurred at 7:40 p.m. Tuesday in the Suzhuang Coal Mine in Mianchi County, Sanmenxia City, about 300 kilometers from the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, said a spokesman of the coal mine rescue headquarters.
