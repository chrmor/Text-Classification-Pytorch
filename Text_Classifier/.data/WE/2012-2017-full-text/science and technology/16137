Giant supernova in the sky smashes previous record, stuns scientists
To calculate the power of this supernova, the researchers needed to find the distance to it. If this apparently dim object was close by, it must have been fairly weak. But if it was far away, then the dim-looking object must actually have been quite powerful, for its light to reach all the way to Earth. The scientists took a spectrum of the supernova from the 10-meter South African Large Telescope and found that the supernova was some 3.8 billion light years away. This thing was really, really bright.
