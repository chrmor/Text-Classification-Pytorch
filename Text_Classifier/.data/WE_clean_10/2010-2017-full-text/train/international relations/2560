"It's wonderful that we are flying to Moscow again," Georgian Airways chairman of the board Tamaz Gaiashvili, one of the 85 people aboard the plane, said before the flight.
'I believe that regular flights will be resumed in the near future, after airline authorities have held talks," he added.
The flight landed at 1:52 p.m. (10:52 GMT). The return flight is due to take off at 3:00 p.m.
Direct flights between Tbilisi and Moscow were suspended in 2006 following a spying row between the former Soviet neighbors. They resumed for a short time in 2008 and were halted again after the South Ossetia war.
