VENICE, LA (WAFB) - Questions are being asked about how thousands of fish turned up dead in a channel in Venice.
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser sent pictures of the dead fish to the media. What could look like a gravel roadway is really thousands of dead fish surfacing near the Venice shipping canal. 
Nungesser says what is really concerning is that normal fish kills caused by low oxygen levels usually only affect one or two species. Crews found crabs, speckled trout, sting rays, and even a dead whale. 
Nungesser says there are currently no tests being conducted at the site to determine what caused the massive kill.
