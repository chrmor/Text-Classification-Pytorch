2010 Is Deadliest Year for NATO in Afghan War
KABUL, Afghanistan â€” The worst helicopter crash in four years killed nine people, bringing NATO fatalities in Afghanistan in 2010 to 529 and making it the most deadly year of the war that began in 2001.
The crash took place in Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan early on Tuesday, according to a NATO statement. A later death brought the total for the year to 530.
The fatality statistics were tallied by iCasualties.org, a Web site that tracks military casualties.
The NATO statement did not list the nationality of the soldiers, but Pentagon officials said Tuesday that most of the dead were Americans.
There was no sign of enemy fire in the area, but the crash is under investigation, according to the statement.
This is the deadliest helicopter crash for NATO forces in Afghanistan since one that killed 10 soldiers in Kunar Province in May 2006.
