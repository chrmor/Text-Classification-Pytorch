Typhoon Bopha: '200,000 in evacuation shelters'
More than 300 people have died and hundreds more are missing in the wake of Typhoon Bopha, which cut a swathe of devastation across the southern Philippines.
Emergency teams are continuing to search for survivors while humanitarian and government agencies try to help those displaced by the storm.
Luiza Carvalho, a UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Manila, told the BBC that an estimated 200,000 people in 420 evacuation shelters were in need of food, water and medicine.
