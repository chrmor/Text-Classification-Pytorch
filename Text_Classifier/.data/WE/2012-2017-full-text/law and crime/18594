Former Moldovan PM Jailed For Nine Years
Former Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat has been sentenced to nine years in jail on corruption charges.
A court in Chisinau on June 27 found Filat guilty of abuse of office and corruption and sentenced him the same day.
The court also ruled to strip Filat of a state award and confiscate his property.
He was also barred from holding public office for five years.
Prosecutors said after the sentence was read out that the ruling was "too mild," and they will appeal it.
Prosecutors had demanded Filat be sent to jail for 19 years.
Filat, who was Moldova's prime minister in 2009-2013, was arrested in mid-October and charged with taking bribes in a $1 billion bank-fraud case.
He has denied any wrongdoing and says the case against him is politically motivated.
