Obama addresses nation on US debt crisis
US President Barack Obama has warned that America's growing debt could cost jobs and do serious damage to the economy, in a rare primetime speech.
Obama has called for a balanced approach to addressing the debt crisis, and says he believes "patriotic Americans" will be willing to pitch in.
The president's speech comes as Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress remain deadlocked over a plan to raise the US debt ceiling and deal with the country's ballooning deficits.
Democrats who control the Senate and Republicans who lead the House of Representatives are at odds over rival plans for raising the $14.3 trillion US debt limit, allowing cash-strapped Washington to stay open as it approaches its August 2 debt limit deadline.
Obama said a short-term debt ceiling extension would just lead to another standoff in six months, describing it as "kicking the can further down the road".
He said he had ordered members of congress to reach a compromise he could sign off on in the next couple of days, and he was confident this could be done.
