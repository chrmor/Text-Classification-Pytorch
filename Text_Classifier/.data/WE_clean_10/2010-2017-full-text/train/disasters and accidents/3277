Strong earthquake strikes off Chilean coast
(CNN) -- A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck offshore some 58 miles south-southwest of Valparaiso, Chile, on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Tremors from the quake were felt in the nation's capital, Santiago, which is east of Valparaiso.
Chile is on the so-called "Ring of Fire," an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
