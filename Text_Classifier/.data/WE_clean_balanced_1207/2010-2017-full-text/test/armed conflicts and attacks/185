Seven killed Sunday in Port Said mass funeral clashes
Seven people have been killed and 450 injured on the day of a mass funeral for victims of Saturday's clashes in Port Said.
On Sunday, mourners at the Al-Mariam Mosque were hit by heavy tear gas shelling from the direction of the nearby army club, reports said.
Injury by live bullets or birdshot reached 21, Abdel-Rahman Farah, general manager of Port Said hospitals told Ahram online.
Ahram's Arabic-language news website said three of the wounded were in a critical condition.
The Ministry of Interior has denied using teargas at the funeral via a message on its official Facebook page.
The ministry claimed several mourners on the funeral march threw Molotov cocktails and shot at police stations.
More than 30 people died during clashes with police in Port Said on Saturday after a court sentenced 21 people to death for their involvement in the Port Said disaster in February 2012.
