Five killed in 'terrorist' raids in Bali
THE five men killed in overnight raids in Bali were Islamic extremist terrorists seeking money to fund attacks on targets including a bar in Bali’s Seminyak tourist strip. Indonesia’s national police spokesman, Faud Usman Nasution, said drawings found at the hotels housing the men demonstrated that they were targeting three businesses including the bar, La Vida Loca, as well as PT Bali Money Changer in Kuta, and a jeweller in the suburb of Jimbaran. Police from the anti-terror squad Detachment 88 found two pistols at the hotels in Bali’s tourist strip where the men were shot and killed overnight. There were also two magazines of ammunition with 48 rounds. However, there were no explosives. Asked about this fact, Mr Nasution said: “Do you rob a cafe? You explode it”. Asked if foreigners were the target he said: “The cafes in Bali are always frequented by foreigners”. He said the men were engaged in robbery to fund jihad. He said they had been killed not captured, because they had shot at police as they raided the two hotels where the men were staying. The five bodies have been flown to Jakarta for autopsies, and the investigation will involved police from Indonesia’s capital. It is almost 10 years since the Bali bombings killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and the tourist industry has rebounded. However another terror attack would be devastating for the place where thousands of Australians go each year. Mr Nasution said police had been tracking the terror cell since March 17, as they followed fugitives from an earlier set of robberies in the city of Medan, in Sumatra, in 2010. He could not say if the robberies were linked to jailed radical preacher Abu Bakar Bashir.
