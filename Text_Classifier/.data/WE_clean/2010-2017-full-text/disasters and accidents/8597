Evacuation of Pa. Governor's Residence in Harrisburg in progress
As the nearby swollen Susquehanna River threatens to spill over its banks, state police cadets and other state workers were busy moving furnishings fromÂ  the Governor's Residence to moving vans parked outside.
Preparations in case an evacuation was necessary began on Wednesday but today, crews were observed filling sandbags to shore up the Residence's walls and moving out furnishings to protect them from the floodwaters caused by remnants of Tropical Storm Lee.
A spokeswoman from Gov. Tom Corbett's press office was not available to discuss the evacuation at the time of this post.
It is only the third time in the 43-year-old Front Street mansion's history that it was evacuated. The first time was in 1972when Tropical Storm Agnes caused floodwaters to rise to about five feet in the State area of the house, and completely flooded the basement. The second time was in 1996.
