Mob attacks French foreign minister's car
(CNN) -- The car of French Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie was attacked Friday in Gaza by a mob of around 20 people -- the family members of Palestinians in Israeli jails.
The group began pounding on her Jeep that was parked outside a Red Cross hospital in Gaza City that Alliot-Marie was visiting and continued as she left for the French Cultural Center. They also threw eggs and shoes at the vehicle.
No Hamas police were at the scene. She was being protected by hospital and her own security.
The families were angered by a demand made by Alliot-Marie that Hamas leadership let Red Cross representatives visit kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who holds dual Israeli and French citizenship.
Palestinian militants crossed into Israel from Gaza on June 25, 2006, and kidnapped Shalit, who was 19 at the time. Israel and Hamas have been negotiating his release through third-party mediators from Egypt and Germany, but talks have started and stalled numerous times.
