Groom kills 3 guests at wedding
Ankara - The state-run news agency says a groom has killed his father and two aunts after opening fire into the air with an automatic weapon to celebrate his wedding.
The Anatolia news agency says eight other relatives were injured during Sunday's celebration in the southeastern province of Gaziantep.
It says the groom lost control of the weapon and accidentally aimed at guests. He was arrested.
It is tradition in Turkey to shoot into the air to celebrate weddings, circumcisions or sports victories.
Turkey has failed to curb the practice despite imposing harsher punishments to cut down on stray bullet accidents.
