Exiled Tibetan Parliament accepts Dalai Lama’s formal proposal of retirement
DHARAMSALA: The exiled Tibetan Parliament here on Friday unanimously accepted the Dalai Lama’s formal proposal of retirement or abdication of political responsibilities and passed the resolution in this regard. To carry out the ratification of the Dalai Lama’s proposal, the exiled parliament will need to change the Tibetan charter. Till the change is made, the Dalai Lama will continue to hold political authority and perform duties like giving oath to the elected head of Tibetan government- in- exile, appointing Chief Election Commissioner, Chief Justice, calling and dissolving the Parliament session and so on. In order to redraft or change the Tibetan charter, a drafting committee comprising members of Parliament and Kashag (exiled Tibetan cabinet) was also formed. The drafting committee after working out the changes in the Tibetan charter to facilitate the transition of power from the exiled spiritual head of Tibetan community, the Dalai Lama, to the elected head of the exiled Tibetan government ,will submit its report to the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile by April 11. The Dalai Lama despite repeated requests from exiled Tibetans and Parliament has refused to change his decision insisting on resigning as political leader but will remain spiritual leader of the exiled Tibetan community.
