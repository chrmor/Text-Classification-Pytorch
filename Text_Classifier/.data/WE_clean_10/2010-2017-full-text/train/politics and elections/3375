Donald Trump selects Mike Pence as VP
(CNN)Donald Trump said Friday Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is his choice to be his running mate.
"I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.," the presumptive Republican nominee tweeted.
CNN reported Thursday that Trump had called Pence and offered him the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Pence has accepted.
The pick sets up a stark clash in styles: a brash presumptive nominee with a tendency to freelance into controversies alongside a cautious former congressional leader who's stuck close to conservative orthodoxy since starting his career in talk radio.
"I haven't made my final, final decision," he told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren Thursday evening. "I mean, I've got three people that are fantastic. I think Newt (Gingrich) is a fantastic person. I think Chris Christie is a fantastic person, been a friend of mine for 15 years. Just a fantastic person. And there's Mike, and Mike has done a great job as governor of Indiana. You look at the numbers, and it's been great -- he's done really a fantastic job. But I haven't made a final, final decision."
"I think he is going to be a great president. I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan. I think he has spoken into the frustration and the longings of the American people as no one since the 40th president, and I think you're going to continue to see him do that," Pence told reporters Tuesday after an event in Indianapolis.
"Look, I served in Congress for 12 years. I've been a governor for three and a half years. I haven't agreed with every one of my Republican colleagues or Democrat colleagues on every issue," Pence said. "But I'm supporting Donald Trump because we need change in this country, and I believe he represents the kind of strong leadership at home and abroad that will, to borrow a phrase, make America great again."
"A campaign ought to be about the advancement of issues whose success or failure is more significant than that of the candidate," Pence wrote. "Whether on the left or the right, candidates ought to leave a legacy -- a foundation of arguments -- in favor of policies upon which their successors can build. William Buckley carries with him a purposeful malapropism. 'Don't just do something,' it says, 'stand there.' "
He advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban that the Republican-dominated Indiana legislature decided went too far in limiting LGBT rights. Then Indiana became the subject of a media storm in 2010 when Pence signed into law a "religious freedom" measure that would have allowed companies to assert that their exercise of religion had been violated as a defense if sued for turning away customers. It was championed by social conservatives who saw it as a shield against same-sex marriages, but drew complaints from organizations like the NCAA and Salesforce, a major Indianapolis employer, and national scrutiny. It led Daniels' former campaign manager, Bill Oesterle, to openly speculate about recruiting a primary challenger for Pence.
Pence has had a fraught relationship with Indiana reporters -- not unlike Trump -- fueled in part by his quickly abandoned 2015 plans to launch a state-run news outlet called "Just IN." Once news of the plan broke, Pence downplayed it as little more than a clearinghouse for news released. But plans drafted by his staff cast it as much more than that, citing "Just IN" as a site that would break state government news ahead of traditional journalists.
