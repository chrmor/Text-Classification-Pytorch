Wisconsin shooting at Brookfield spa leaves three dead
A man who opened fire at a beauty spa in the US state of Wisconsin killed three women, including his wife, and injured four others on Sunday.
Radcliffe Haughton, 45, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield, where his wife, Zina, had worked.
He had recently been given a restraining order after being accused of slashing his wife's car tyres.
Of the four women injured, one remained in critical condition on Monday.
A Wisconsin medical examiner confirmed Mrs Haughton as one of the three victims on Monday. The others were identified as 35-year-old Cary Robuck and 38-year-old Maelyn Lind.
The shooting began around 11:15 (15:15 GMT) on Sunday.
A quick-reaction Swat team and hostage negotiators were sent to the scene, in addition to FBI agents. Police searched the surrounding area, ordering customers at a nearby mall to stay inside.
Brookfield Police Chief Dan Tushaus said the first officers on the scene found the building full of smoke from a fire believed to have been set by Haughton.
Areas near the spa in Brookfield, including a shopping centre and hospital, were locked down, as police searched for the gunman. He was eventually found in one of the spa's locked rooms.
The White House issued a statement saying Barack and Michelle Obama's thoughts and prayers were with the victims of "this horrible shooting" and their families.
The governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, also expressed his sympathy for the victims, saying: "Senseless acts of violence leave us with heavy hearts and many questions."
It was the second mass shooting in Wisconsin this year.
In August, Wade Michael Page, a US Army veteran with ties to white-power groups, killed six people as they prepared for a service at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee.
