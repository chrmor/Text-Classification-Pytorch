Fabrice Muamba critical: Howard Webb removed as fourth official at Molineux
Howard Webb has been removed from his fourth official duties at Molineux today after Fabrice Muamba's mid-match collapse left him no choice but to abandon yesterday’s FA Cup tie between Spurs and Bolton.
Referee's chief Mike Riley has granted Webb a leave of absence, allowing the World Cup official to miss this afternoon's Barclays Premier League game between Wolves and Manchester United.
Riley’s decision comes after consulting a  psychologist who works with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PMGMOL).
Webb was forced to dramatically call Saturday's match off when Trotters midfielder Muamba collapsed in the centre of the White Hart Lane pitch after suffering a suspected heart attack in front of 36,000 fans and a television audience of a million.
The 23-year-old, who was reported to have stopped breathing, received cardio-resuscitation treatment from doctors and paramedics as shocked and distressed players from both sides looked on.
After 10 minutes of treatment, Muamba was carried from the field on a stretcher and rushed to the London Chest Hospital, where he was still being treated late on Saturday night.
Bolton boss Owen Coyle accompanied the stricken player to the hospital and later emerged to give an update on the player's progress.
'Fabrice is critically ill. The next 24 hours are going to be absolutely crucial.'
'We've obviously been inundated with people wishing him well and we hope that if everybody can pray strongly tonight that Fabrice is able to recover.
'It's very serious. There's not getting away from that. He's critically ill and God willing he makes it through.'
Fans have been leaving flowers and messages of support outside the centre as Muamba remains in a 'critical' state.
