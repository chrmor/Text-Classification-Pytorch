NATO Strike Kills 3 Afghan Policemen
KABUL, Afghanistan — A NATO airstrike killed three Afghan police officers in central Afghanistan on Sunday in what Afghan officials said was friendly fire. Two more police officers died Monday in a suicide car bomb attack in the southern Taliban stronghold of Kandahar Province.
Also on Monday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan to assess progress toward the transfer of military authority to the country and to meet with President Hamid Karzai.
NATO said it was sending an assessment team to investigate the airstrike, which occurred early Sunday morning in the central province of Daykondi. The coalition said a team was conducting a patrol in the village of Baladas when it spotted “nine armed individuals setting up what appeared to be an ambush position.” The team called in a helicopter strike, killing three men and wounding three.
Gen. Abdul Baqir Murtzawi, deputy police chief of the province, said the Afghans were members of a local police team who were on their way to meet a unit of the American Special Forces for a joint patrol when the helicopters swept in. Before joining the police, the men were members of a local self-defense force called Arbakai, General Murtzawi said.
Lt. Cmdr. Katie Kendrick, a coalition spokeswoman, said she could not confirm General Murtzawi’s account because she was not familiar with all of the details of the operation. “This is information the assessment team is going out to gather,” she said.
