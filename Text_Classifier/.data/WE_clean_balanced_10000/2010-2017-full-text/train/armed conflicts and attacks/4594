A bomb explosion at an apartment building on the outskirts of the Thai capital of Bangkok has killed at least three people.
Police speculate that a bomb of up to 50 kilograms in size may have cause the blast.
The blast happened about 6.00pm (local time) at an apartment block at Nonthaburi, just outside Bangkok.
A seven-year-old child has been left with a fractured skull from the blast.
There have been many small explosions and grenade attacks in Bangkok since anti-government protests were dispersed in May.
The province was one of three included in an extension of emergency rule announced yesterday due to recent political unrest.
