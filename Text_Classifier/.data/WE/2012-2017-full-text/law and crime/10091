Prison for 5 in Murder of Journalist
The sentences for the men, who were convicted last month, were the toughest punishment to date in the long-running investigation into Ms. Politkovskaya’s death.
Yet that investigation has yielded little publicly about who wanted Ms. Politkovskaya killed and why.
“The case cannot be closed because it has not been solved,” Vera Politkovskaya, Ms. Politkovskaya’s daughter, said by telephone.
Critics have claimed there is a lack of political will in Russia for finding who stood behind Ms. Politkovskaya’s killing. After her death, President Vladimir V. Putin at a news conference in Dresden sought to play down Ms. Politkovskaya’s influence, calling her reporting “extremely insignificant for political life in Russia.”
Ms. Politkovskaya’s murder, Mr. Putin said, brought Russia “far greater injuries and damage than her publications.”
Since then, the investigation has lumbered forward with arrests, releases and retrials. In 2012, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, a retired police lieutenant colonel, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for organizing surveillance of Ms. Politkovskaya before her murder, but denied he had ordered the killing.
