It's not likely, SourceDNA reported, that the hundreds of apps and their developers were all in on the trick. Since the Youmi code was fairly common and it took a careful breakdown of it to identify the sketchy functions, it's more likely these app creators had no idea and Youmi was acting alone.
"Given how simple this obfuscation is and how long the apps have been available that have it, weâ€™re concerned other published apps may be using different but related approaches to hide their malicious behavior," wrote SourceDNA in its blog post.
