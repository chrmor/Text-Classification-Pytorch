51 killed after truck plunges 300 metres off ravine in Peru
At least 51 people, including 12 children, have been killed in Peru after a truck veered off a cliff and plunged into a ravine in the country's south-east.
A local mayor in the La Convencion province says the truck was carrying revellers from a regional party when it plunged 300 metres in a remote area near the town of Suyucuyo.
Local prosecutor Juan Carlos Valverde said none of the truck's occupants survived. A previous toll had put the number of dead at 49.
The crash was the third such incident nationwide this month, all occurring in the southern Andean region of the country and killing a total of 80 people.
Officials say an investigation is underway to determine if the driver - who was also killed along with his wife and children - was drunk at the time of the accident.
Deadly crashes are commonplace in Peru, where poorly maintained roads zigzag up and down the towering Andes.
Worsening the problem, drivers are often inexperienced and buses are known to break down frequently.
In the last week, two other deadly crashes in southern Peru took 19 and 10 lives, respectively.
More than 4,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in 2012, according to official statistics.
