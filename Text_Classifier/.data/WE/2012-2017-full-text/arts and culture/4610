Hundreds of people attended the funeral of mountaineer Ian McKeever in Co Wicklow.
The adventurer died on Mount Kilimanjaro last week after he was struck by lightning during a storm.
Many young people, who climbed the Tanzanian mountain with Mr Keever, were among the congregation at the Church of St Laurence O'Toole in Roundwood.
Mr McKeever's parents and fianc√©e were among the mourners.
The Taoiseach was represented by his Aide-de-Camp Commandant Michael Treacy.
Mr McKeever was cremated in a private ceremony after the funeral mass.
The 42-year-old was leading a group of climbers, including several people from Ireland, when they were struck by a lightning storm three days into the climb.
Mr McKeever was a well-known figure in adventure sports and had attempted several world records, including the Seven Summits Challenge in 2007.
In his last blog entry in October, he reflected on a tough but rewarding season climbing on Kilimanjaro and considered how heroes are judged.
He wrote: "A hero is someone we can all admire without apology."
