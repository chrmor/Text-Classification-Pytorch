Voters in Albania go to the polls in an election important to the country's European Union candidacy, with both the ruling Socialist Party and the rival Democratic Party looking to gain a majority in the country's parliament. Voting is extended by one hour because of Eid al-Fitr celebrations and 39 °C (102 °F) degree temperatures. (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) (ABC News)
