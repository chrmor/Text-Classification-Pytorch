Bangladesh's climate refugees
The coastlines of Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have become a flashpoint for sudden cyclones and tidal floods. With every natural disaster more of the population is forced to leave their homes and livelihoods and relocate.
Photo journalist Mohammad Rakibul Hasan visited the coastal district of Shatkhira in Bangladesh to document the struggles of the region's climate refugees. Cyclones ‘Sidr’, ‘Aila’, ‘Layla’ and ‘Nargis’ all hit this place in recent years and resulted in a massive loss of life, as well as displacing many people. These are the world’s ‘climate refugees’, having to move to nearby districts or Dhaka city. Climate funds from overseas cannot settle these refugees properly unless corruption within government, corporations and NGOs is addressed. Hasan says the the fate of Bangladesh’s climate refugees is predictable: misery. 'It seems to be a silent genocide,' he adds.
This is the frontline of a changing climate.
