Hamas to Israelis: "Wait for suicide attacks on every bus, café and street"
on every bus, café and street" "Start counting the number of coffins you'll need"   Hamas broadcast numerous videos in Hebrew today in an attempt at psychological warfare against Israel, or at least an attempt to make its own people think it is successfully intimidating Israel. The videos included threats to return to suicide bombings, stabbings and other terror attacks against Israelis. Hamas also falsely claimed to have hit the Israeli Parliament and made it "tremble" once, and threatened to do it again. The following are the texts threatening Israelis: "Zionists, wait and see terror attacks, stabbing everywhere. Wait for suicide attacks on every bus, café and street. Wait for the rage and for revenge for Gaza, wait for the flames of the West Bank, inside you." "Zionists, [we] can reach you above ground and below it. So start counting the number of coffins you'll need in these months." "Zionists, do you still remember the rockets that made Tel-Aviv and the Israeli Parliament tremble? We just wanted to tell you that we have thousands of them." "Zionists, the resistance has many goals, it has the ability to reach places you thought were safe. Look, they [the rockets] are on their way to you, now they will reach you soon."  As Hamas keeps launching rockets against Israel, and as Israel's Operation Protective Edge responds by targeting Hamas' terror infrastructure, Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement is openly supporting Hamas. PMW has documented threats made by Fatah on  from the south to the north... The KN-103 rocket is on its way you."
