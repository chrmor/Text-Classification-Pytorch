Dublin Zoo's family of orangutans were preparing for an influx of guests yesterday as plans to give red-haired children free entry this weekend were revealed.
As part of efforts to raise awareness about the endangered species, all red-haired children under the age of 16, and those children who make the effort to dress up as orang utans will get in to the zoo for free on Saturday and Sunday.
Special children's activities are also planned, and the zoo's orangutan keepers will be on hand between 11am and 3pm each day to answer the public's questions about the animals.
Orangutans are one of the closet relatives to man but face extinction in the wild.
Dublin Zoo has four orangutans: 32-year-old Sibu; his partner Leonie (27); Rhiona (14) and five-year-old Mujur.
