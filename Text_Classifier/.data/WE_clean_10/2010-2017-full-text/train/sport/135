All-Ireland senior hurling final replay Preview and Live score updates
In the senior replay, Kilkenny and Galway square off once again after their titanic tussle was drawn three weeks ago.
Kilkenny showed for the majority of the drawn game that they can still play great hurling, filled with drive, fantastic skill and a strong desire to win more All-Ireland titles.
They were behind by five points at half time but still would have won the match were it not for Canning’s last gasp free.
But they couldn’t finish the job and that will surely give Galway great hope.
The experience of playing in the occasion will mean little for the maroon and whites however as Kilkenny will always be the more streetwise and adaptable.
The game on 9th September was hell for leather from word go but this time is likely to be more cagey.
Henry Shefflin was allowed into the game the last day and as he stacked point on top of point it gave Kilkenny more and more confidence.
Galway need a thorough display from their half-backs and midfield and try to run the Cats as much as possible near their own goal.
Few sights of goal, forcing shooting from distance like we saw in this summer’s Leinster Final, can be Kilkenny’s downfall.
Anthony Cunningham’s team showed there is plenty there for them, but they need to come up with the same decisive spell seen in that Leinster final to emerge with victory again.
Kilkenny were a tiring side three weeks ago, and Galway’s exuberance may win out this weekend, though this game is likely to be just as tight as the tussle at the start of the month.
