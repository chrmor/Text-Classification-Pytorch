Algeria police violently disperse election protest
Algerian police violently dispersed an attempt by opposition activists to stage a protest in the capital against the president's running for a fourth term in Thursday's elections.
Only a few members of the grass-root organization Barakat were able to assemble in central Algiers Wednesday before police tackled them and forced them to march away in front of a group of international journalists.
Past protests by Barakat -- which means "enough" in Arabic -- were allowed to take place in Algiers.
The group has protested against the political system, and particularly President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
Despite failing health, Bouteflika is expected to dominate Thursday's election.
