Quake reported in Iran
State television in Iran says an earthquake east of Tehran has caused damage in three villages, injuring three people.
The US Geological Survey says the earthquake measured 5.7 on the Richter Scale.
It was centered about 150km south of the city of Gorgan, northeast of Tehran, at a depth of 10km.
In 2003, an earthquake flattened the desert city of Bam and killed 31,000 people.
