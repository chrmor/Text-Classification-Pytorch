Colorado: Massacre Suspect Pursues Insanity Defense
Defense lawyers for James E. Holmes, who is charged with opening fire in an Aurora movie theater last summer, said in court filings Tuesday that he intended to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Mr. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more. Earlier this year, after Mr. Holmes’s defense team said it was not ready to enter a plea, Judge William B. Sylvester entered a standard not guilty plea on Mr. Holmes’s behalf. A new judge in the case, Carlos A. Samour Jr., will rule on the plea change.
