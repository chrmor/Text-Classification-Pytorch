Swiss visit by Bush cancelled
Plans for former United States President George Bush to visit Switzerland next week have been abandoned amid calls for his arrest.
Mr Bush was to be the keynote speaker at an event in Geneva on 12 February.
Organisers have announced that they were cancelling his participation on security grounds.
But pressure has been building on the Swiss government to arrest Mr Bush and open a criminal investigation if he enters the country.
Court officials say criminal complaints accusing Mr Bush of torture have been lodged in Geneva.
He has admitted in his memoirs and television interviews to ordering use of the waterboarding interrogation technique.
However, judicial officials have said that Mr Bush would still enjoy a certain diplomatic immunity as a former head of state.
