Washington Wildfire Is Now Largest in State History
The massive fire burning in north-central Washington is now the largest in state history.
The Okanogan Complex of wildfires has surpassed last year's Carlton Complex blazes, fire spokesman Rick Isaacson said Monday morning.
The blaze was measured overnight at just over 400 square miles, slightly more than the Carlton fires, which also burned in Okanogan County.
Isaacson called the record unfortunate and said the fire could burn until rain and snow season arrives.
"It's only Aug. 24th," he said. "In our district we could see this go clear to the first of November."
The Okanogan Complex grew by more than 26 square miles Sunday and is expected to grow even more in coming days.
