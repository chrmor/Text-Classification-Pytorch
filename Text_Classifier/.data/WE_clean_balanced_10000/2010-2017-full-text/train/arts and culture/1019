Thomas Pynchon finally gives in to gravity as digital backlist is published
Thomas Pynchon has bowed to the inevitable and allowed his entire backlist to be published in digital format. The reclusive author of acclaimed novels including the National Book award-winning Gravity's Rainbow, The Crying of Lot 49 and Against the Day had previously refused to consent to ebook editions of his books. But US publisher Penguin Press has now persuaded him of the merits of ebooks, and digital versions of his eight titles will go on sale from Thursday.
Pynchon, typically, declined to comment on the move. But Penguin Press president Ann Godoff told the New York Times that the author was motivated by a desire to attract more fans. "I think he wants to have more readers," she said. "Every writer wants to have as many readers as they can possibly get. But I don't think this will change his public profile, in terms of him being out there in public. In fact, I know it won't."
The digital issue "wasn't exactly the elephant in the drawing room, but we just felt that the moment was right," she added. "There has been a great desire to have all of Tom's books in digital format now, for many years. He didn't want to not be part of that."
Pynchon's decision follows that of another digital holdout, the late Ray Bradbury, who said ebooks "smell like burned fuel" and that "the internet is a big distraction", but finally allowed his most famous novel, Fahrenheit 451, to be published as an ebook last November.
Pynchon will not, however, become a reader of ebooks himself, according to Godoff. "I think he reads in print," she said.
