‘Brexit,’ Migration, Trade: E.U.’s List of Crises Keeps Growing
BRUSSELS — It has come to this for the European Union: Its trade policy was being held hostage on Thursday by the Walloons.
Facing a set of debilitating crises, the bloc’s leaders assembled on Thursday for a two-day summit meeting that only underscored how the fractious domestic politics of its 28 member countries are undercutting its ability to confront mounting challenges and restore a sense of common purpose.
An accord with Ukraine backed by every other country risked being derailed by the Netherlands, highlighting again the European Union’s inability to carry out a muscular foreign policy. Consensus over a toughening of sanctions policy toward Russia appeared as elusive as ever despite Moscow’s escalation of the conflict in Syria, reflecting the varied economic and political interests in European capitals.
The budget discipline that Brussels, urged on by Germany and other northern nations, tries to impose on member governments as a condition of membership in the euro currency, is fraying as calls grow, especially from poorer southern countries, to move away from austerity policies after years of lackluster growth. And then there is the proposed trade deal with Canada, a centerpiece of European Union policy, which is being blocked by the French-speaking Walloons of Belgium.
