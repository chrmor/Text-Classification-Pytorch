Phil Rudd: charge against AC/DC drummer of attempting to procure murder dropped
New Zealand prosecutors withdraw charge against drummer due to lack of evidence, his lawyer says
The charge of attempting to procure murder against AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has been dropped a day after he appeared in a New Zealand court.
Rudd hired Queen’s Counsel Paul Mabey to represent him and on Friday he released a statement saying Rudd’s most serious charge had been withdrawn. It was not clear whether the other charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs remained.
“I was advised by the Crown Solicitor, [Greg] Hollister-Jones, that he had reviewed the police file and the available evidence to support the charge of attempting to procure murder,” Mabey’s statement said.
“He had formed the view that there was insufficient evidence to justify that charge. He has now withdrawn the charge.”
A spokeswoman for Hollister-Jones confirmed the procuring charge had been withdrawn, the New Zealand Herald reported.
The 60-year-old was the subject of a raid in the North Island on Thursday morning and appeared in Tauranga district court in New Zealand in the afternoon.
He did not apply to suppress his name and was bailed until 27 November.
According to court documents, Rudd was accused of attempting to hire one person to kill two others between 25 September and 26 September.
He was also accused of threatening to kill a complainant on 26 September.
Rudd’s arrest came as AC/DC were preparing to release Rock or Bust, the band’s first album of original material since Black Ice was released six years ago. Founding guitarist Malcolm Young recently left the band after his family announced he had developed dementia.
Rudd joined AC/DC in 1975. He was dropped in 1983, but rejoined in 1994.
