Ronald Reagan road proposed in Copenhagen
In commemoration of what would have been Ronald Reagan's 100th birthday, the Liberal Alliance (LA) now wants to name a street in the capital after the former US president, reports Ekstra Bladet newspaper.
“Reagan won the Cold War without firing a single shot,” said Lars Berg Dueholm, the party's political group leader at the City Council. ”That makes him one of the 20th century's greatest statesmen and it deserves to be honoured by us here in Copenhagen.”
Dueholm, who is also a member of the council's street naming committee, where the proposal will now be presented, pointed out that Denmark has a tradition for honouring the greatest foreign politicians by naming a street or a town square after them, for example Churchill Park.
He said that the Østerbro district would be a good place for the new street name, preferably near the Amerika Plads (‘America Square’).
