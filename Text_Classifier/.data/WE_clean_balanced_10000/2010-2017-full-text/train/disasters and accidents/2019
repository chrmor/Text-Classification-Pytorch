Bd Today:SAVAR BUILDING COLLAPSE-Death toll jumps to 1,042
The death toll from Savar building collapse has reached 1,042 on Friday, the 17th day of the disaster. Twenty nine bodies were recovered between 6:00am and 12:30am, according to army control room in Savar. Rescuers earlier expected to come close to a wrap-up by Friday morning, but the fresh recoveries show signs that the rescue operation may go on for two days more. Colonel Ibn Fazal Shayekuzzaman, coordinating staff of the rescue operation, told this to The Daily Star on Friday, adding that the rescue team reached close to the basement from both front and back portions of the collapsed building. The rescuers have information that nearly 45 cars were parked at the basement. They still expect more bodies from the rubble of Rana Plaza at Savar as many have remained missing since the countryâ€™s deadliest industrial disaster on April 24. Meanwhile, Abdul Ahad Ansari, chairman, standing committee of Labour Education of Welfare of BGMEA, said 1,793 workers who survived the collapse have been paid. According to the ISPR control room, the number of people rescued alive were 2,437. Rana Plaza, which housed several garment factories, collapsed after owners forced several thousand workers to work there even after cracks had developed on some pillars and floors the day before. It is still unclear how many workers were there on that fateful day.
