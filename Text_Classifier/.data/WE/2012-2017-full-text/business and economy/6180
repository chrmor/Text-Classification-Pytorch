Caterpillar to lay off 300 employees by July
Earth-moving equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. said Friday will lay off an additional 300 employees in Decatur, Ill., by July.
Peoria-based Caterpillar said in April that it planned to cut roughly 500 workers at that facility. Together, the 800 layoffs represent about 20 percent of the plant's workforce.
"Products built in Decatur are used in the mining industry, which has witnessed weaker market conditions when compared to last year," the company said in a statement, adding that most of the layoffs will affect production workers. "Ultimately, with the softening in this sector, we must take steps to bring production in line with demand."
