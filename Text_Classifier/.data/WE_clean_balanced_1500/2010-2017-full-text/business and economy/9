Occupy Wall Street protests return for one-year anniversary – as it happened
Around 300-400 protesters left Zucotti Park and have been roaming around lower Manhattan for the last half hour or so, turning left or right down side streets depending on the police presence, which is large and strict. Officers are keeping protesters on the sidewalks, sporadically making rapid arrests as people deviate into the street.
"Honestly? It's a bit dead," said Jefferson Meighan, who had travelled from an hour away to attend today's activities. "We planned too much in advance, so police know what we're doing."
Meighan was not optimistic about the effect today would have on Occupy. "A lot of the mainstream media don't pay much attention."
Kevin Limiti, a 22-year-old protester from Long Island, said he had "about an hour's sleep" last night due to excitement.
"It's certainly empowering," he said of the protests, but was aggrieved at the number of arrests made by police. "We don't seem like we get the chance to protest freely."
