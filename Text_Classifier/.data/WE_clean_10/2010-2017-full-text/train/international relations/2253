Ron Prosor named Israel's new ambassador to the UN -  Haaretz - Israel News
An Israeli veteran diplomat who has held senior positions in Europe and Washington has been appointed Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.
Ron Prosor is currently Israel's ambassador to Britain.
He takes over at a time when Mideast regimes are in turmoil and the international community is pressuring Israel to take bold moves to revive peacemaking with the Palestinians.
The Palestinians have been trying unilaterally to rally support for their cause at the UN.
Many countries in recent months have upgraded Palestinian missions to full-fledged embassies, and some countries have recognized a Palestinian state based on pre-Six Day War borders.
Prosor is a former director of Israel's Foreign Ministry. He also has held diplomatic positions in London, Bonn and Washington.
The U.N. mission has had an acting ambassador, Meron Reuben, since its last envoy, Gabriela Shalev, left last summer. Â
