Death toll from Canary Islands building collapse rises to 7
MADRID (AP) â€” Spanish emergency services on Saturday recovered the body of a man from the rubble of a four-story apartment building that collapsed in a popular Canary Island tourist town, raising the death toll to seven.
The Canary Islands' emergency service said in its official Twitter account that sniffer dogs on Saturday had located the body of an apartment resident who had been missing since the building in the southern coastal town of Los Cristianos had collapsed Thursday.
Earlier, the local government of the southern region of Arona said rescue teams had recovered the bodies of four women and two men.
The building had collapsed in a built-up location near the beach in the town on the island of Tenerife. Three people suffered injuries. It was unclear how many people were in the building when it collapsed.
Witnesses told Spanish media the building had been undergoing renovations.
