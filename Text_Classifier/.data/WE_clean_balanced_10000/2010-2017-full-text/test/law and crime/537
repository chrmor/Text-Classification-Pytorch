Biddeston shooting: Boy, two adults killed at home near Toowoomba
Three people are dead following a shooting at a house on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane.
Police said the victims were a 52-year-old man, a 27-year-old woman and a seven-year-old boy.
Police said they died as a result of gunshot wounds.
It is understood police were called to the property in Biddeston, near Toowoomba, by paramedics at 6:55pm on Monday night.
Officers then waited for backup at the home on Biddeston-Southbrook Road before entering.
Detective Inspector David Isherwood said police were confident there was no threat to public safety.
"This is a terrible situation that has claimed the lives of a woman and her son," he said.
"I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation, however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non-suspicious."
Forensic teams arrived late on Monday night and by daylight scientific officers were still at the scene. The street remains cordoned off.
Paul Farmer, the owner of the town's local convenience store, said Biddeston was a small and close-knit community.
"Everybody knows everybody in this thing," he said.
"I saw the flashing lights and thought it was a car accident.
"But I went out there and saw all of the news crews and everything â€“ one of the news crews told me three people were dead."
