Ex-President of Japan's Olympus Pleads Guilty
TOKYOâ€”Former Olympus Corp. President Tsuyoshi Kikukawa admitted guilt Tuesday in a cover-up of massive investment losses at the Japanese camera and medical-equipment maker.
The scandal emerged last year when Michael Woodford, the company's British chief executive, raised questions about payments for financial advice and dubious acquisitions. Mr. Woodford was later fired.
