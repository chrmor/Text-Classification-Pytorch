Winter brings snow...to Cairo
Meteorologists have said that Egypt's current cold weather will continue on Saturday, as reports come in of the first snowfall in Cairo in a number of years.
Temperatures currently range between 5 and 11 degrees Celsius (41-52 degrees Fahrenheit) in Cairo, and are expected to sink to around 2-3 degrees Celsius (36-37 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday night.
Residents of upscale developments on the outskirts of Cairo, including Madinaty to the east of the capital, reported snowfall on Friday morning.
Cairo has also seen heavy rain and sleet, which are expected to continue for the rest of the day in the capital and in a number of other governorates.
The stateâ€™s highest summit, St. Catherine in Sinai, will record sub-zero temperatures of -2 degrees Celsius (28 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday, according to the Egyptian Meteorological Authority.
Both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea were hit by high winds of between 25-30 knots per hour, the authority stated.
Egyptians took to social media in droves to comment on the cold weather, with many claiming the winter has been the coldest on record for over a hundred years. However, the Egyptian Meteorological Authority has denied the claim.
