As Greek crisis continues, the prime minister offers to step down
Clashes between police and protesters were reported in the Greek capital, Athens, on Wednesday as thousands gathered for nationwide strikes against government reforms, tax hikes and spending cuts.
Police fired teargas to break up the mass demonstration in front of parliament, where lawmakers were debating the cost-cutting proposals.
Protestors had said they would form a human ring around the parliament building, but some 1,500 police earlier descended on the building, blocking access using water cannon and barricades.
Transport and public services were crippled by the nationwide walk outs, as were been banks, government offices and schools. Hospitals were said to be operating with skeleton staff.
Greek journalists also walked off the job for 24 hours causing a domestic media blackout. Flights, however, were believed to be running according to schedule after the air traffic controllers' union called off their participation in the strike.
The Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou aims to push the controversial austerity measures worth some 28 billion euros ($41 billion) through parliament by the end of the month. To the chagrin of most Greeks, the package involves spending cuts and tax hikes worth 6.5 billion euros.
