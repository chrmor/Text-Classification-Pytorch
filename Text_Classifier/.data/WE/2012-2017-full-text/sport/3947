NHL lockout claims All-Star game and schedule through 14 December
The NHL has called off all games through 14 December, plus the 2013 NHL All-Star game that was scheduled for 27 January in Columbus, Ohio. The league made the announcement on Friday, the 69th day of the NHL's lockout of its players.
The new cancellations come as little surprise. The two sides had an unproductive negotiating session on Wednesday that produced no movement to break an impasse over splitting more than $3bn in revenue and also player contracts. A total of 422 regular-season games, more than 34% of the season, have now been lost.
The NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said losing the All-Star weekend in Columbus was "extremely disappointing". A ticketing refund policy has been announced.
"The reality of losing more regular-season games as well as the 2013 NHL All-Star Weekend in Columbus is extremely disappointing," said Daly in a statement. "We feel badly for NHL fans and particularly those in Columbus, and we intend to work closely with the Blue Jackets organization to return the NHL All-Star events to Columbus and their fans as quickly as possible."
