Stephen Bunting crowned BDO World Darts champion at Lakeside
Stephen Bunting defeated Alan Norris 7-4 to be crowned the BDO World Darts champion at Lakeside on Sunday night. It was Bunting's first world title and he could barely express his joy as tears rolled down his face.
"This is my eighth time at the Lakeside. The crowd has been fantastic. Thanks to everyone who has supported me," he said.
The match had been evenly poised at 3-3 before Bunting moved 6-3 ahead. Norris claimed the 10th set in a brief comeback but it was quickly halted by the 28-year-old from Liverpool who took the next to claim the victory.
Norris, 41, who saw off Dutchman Jan Dekker 6-5 in the semi-finals, was ahead only after the opening set before Bunting took the next two to move into the lead.
Norris kept within touching distance, though, and levelled the contest at 3-3 before Bunting, known as "the Bullet'' showed class to move three sets clear and put one hand on the trophy.
