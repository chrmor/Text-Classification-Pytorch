Kenya's David Rudisha smashes 800m world record at Berlin meeting
The 21-year-old former junior world champion shaved two-hundredths of a second of the previous mark set by Denmark’s Kenyan born Wilson Kipketer 13 years ago, becoming the only track athlete to break a world record this season.
Led through the first 400 metres in 48.65sec by pacemaker Sammy Tangui, Rudisha maintained his speed over the final lap to fulfil the prediction made by Kipketer a year ago.
Rudisha said: “I met him last year and he told me, 'I can see you have a future in the 800 and you can beat the world record’. He encouraged me to go for it.”
He added: “This was my first real attempt to break the world record. I knew I was good. I had trained hard. Now that I have run that time, I can say I have the ability to improve and go faster.” Last year, Rudisha only reached the 800m semi-finals at the World Championships but this season he has been the outstanding performer over the two-lap distance.
Then. at a meeting in the Belgian city of Heusden-Zolder in July, Rudisha clocked 1-41.51 - an African record and the fastest time in the world since Kipketer set the previous best in 1997.
“Last year, I had a bad time in Berlin, so I did not want to talk too much about the world record before the race,” he said.
“But I knew it was my day. The weather was good and I told my pacemaker to run the first lap in under 49 seconds. He did a great job, but in the last 200 metres I had to push really hard.
“When I saw the clock at the end, it was amazing, a fantastic feeling. I am very happy to be the fastest 800 metres runner in the world.” Andy Turner, the European 110m hurdles champion, produced one of the best performances of the season to finish second behind American Ryan Wilson in a quick time of 13.30sec. Fellow Briton William Sharman was third in 13m.44sec. Mark Lewis-Francis, the European 100m silver medallist, could manage only seventh in his race in 10.40sec.
