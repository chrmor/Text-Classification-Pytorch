Generators blamed for building collapse
Dhaka - A top investigator probing the Bangladesh garment factory disaster in which more than 500 people died said on Friday that four huge generators placed on the roof of the building had caused it to collapse.
"Four huge generators were set up on the roof, violating rules," Main Uddin Khandaker, a senior home ministry official heading a government investigation team, told AFP.
"When these generators were started after a power cut they created vibration, and together with the vibration of thousands of sewing machines, they triggered the collapse," he said.
