Connecticut Governor Declares State of Emergency Ahead of Irene
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has declared a state of emergency in Connecticut as the state prepares for the effects of Hurricane Irene.
The declaration signed by the governor on Thursday gives him powers including the ability to order evacuations and direct civil preparedness forces into action.
Malloy said he decided the measure is necessary because of the projected storm path that threatens a direct hit on Connecticut over the weekend. He said it will help officials react more quickly in the event of a serious event.
Connecticut residents stocked up on generators and other provisions Thursday as officials warned they should prepare for potentially prolonged power outages from Hurricane Irene, which threatened to dump up to a foot of rain on this already saturated state.
