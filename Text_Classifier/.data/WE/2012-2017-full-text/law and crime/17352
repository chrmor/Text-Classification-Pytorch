Lackland Air Force Base active shooter
At least two died in a Friday shooting at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.
The Bexar County Sheriff's office said its deputies continued to search the base, and that they had found at least two dead in the incident. The scene was still considered active as of 10:40 a.m., ET, but a representative for the sheriff told MSNBC his office did not believe there was still an active shooter situation.
The spokesman said the incident was an apparent murder-suicide.
The official account for the sheriff first posted on Twitter about the active shooter reports at 9:50 a.m., ET.
About 25 minutes later, the same account said officials were working to clear the base's buildings.
Soon after, the sheriff's account said "we have victims" at the still active scene.
