Sweden have been trying to sell their Gripen jet to the F-16 owners club (Denmark, Norway, Holland, Greece etc) for a long time, but have been outdone by the F22 and the Eurofighter. SAAB must be toasting in champagne because of this, they can have the Gripen prove its worth - and in cooperation with other western aircraft to boot.It's gotta suck being a defence contractor in a neutral country.
