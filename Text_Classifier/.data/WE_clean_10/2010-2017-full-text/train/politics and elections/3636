The World On Arirang
Tens of thousands of soldiers and performers marched through the streets of Pyeongyang on Sunday morning, as one of the last remaining communist regimes celebrated the 65th anniversary of its Workers' Party. During the parade the leader in waiting and youngest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un, made a high profile public debut, presiding over the reclusive state's largest-ever military parade. A Seoul unification ministry official said Kim Jong-un's attendance at that event is meant to further increase his standing as the country's next leader. The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency aired live footage of the parade from 9:30 a.m. to 11:18 a.m., local time, a first for the country. In an unprecedented move, Pyeongyang invited roughly 80 foreign media agencies including AP, Reuters, and CNN to attend the parade. Experts believe, Pyeongyang's invitation of foreign media outlets was an intentional move to give a momentous public debut and set a firm succession path for Kim Jong Un, who just last month was made a four-star general and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.
