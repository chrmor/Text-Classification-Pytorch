Turkish police detain two British Vice News journalists
Turkish police have detained two British journalists from Vice News who were covering the unrest in the restive Kurdish dominated southeast, the media company confirmed.
"A VICE News journalist, cameraman and fixer were detained by local police last night in Diyarbakir, Turkey while reporting in the region," a spokesperson from the media company said in an emailed statement.
"VICE News is working closely with the relevant authorities to secure their immediate release."
Vice declined to reveal the identities of the two journalists for "security reasons".
Security sources in Diyarbakir said the journalists and the Turkish fixer were held by "anti-terror police" but refused to comment why because "the investigation is still continuing".
The detention comes at a time of surge in violence in the south-east between Turkish security forces and Kurdish militants which nullified a 2013 truce.
The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has been staging daily attacks against Turkish armed forces as the military keeps up air raids and operations against its strongholds in south-east Turkey as well as northern Iraq.
According to figures published Thursday by the state-run Anatolia news agency before the latest incidents, 918 PKK militants have been killed in the latest campaign.
