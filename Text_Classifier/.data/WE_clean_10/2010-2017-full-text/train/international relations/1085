The World On Arirang
North Korea says it is operating a modern uranium enrichment facility with thousands of centrifuges. Pyeongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday citing the Rodong Shinmun newspaper that the regime is busy building light water reactors and that uranium is needed to power them. The report also said the facility is for peaceful nuclear energy development aimed at meeting the growing demand for electricity in the country. North Korea first revealed its uranium program earlier this month to an American scientist claiming it had 2-thousand centrifuges in operation.
