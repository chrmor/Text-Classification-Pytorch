Israeli fire wounds two workers in Gaza
Israeli forces wounded two Palestinian workers in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, emergency services spokesman said. The two Palestinians were collecting gravel near Gaza City's eastern border with Israel when Israeli soldiers shot them, Adham Abu Selmiya said. Since February 2010, two Palestinian civilians were killed and 117 others were wounded by Israeli fire near the enclave's border with Israel, where Israel allocated a 300-meter-wide buffer zone.
