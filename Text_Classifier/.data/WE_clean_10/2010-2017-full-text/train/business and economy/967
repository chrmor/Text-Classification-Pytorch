China inflation quickens as economy heats up
Chinese inflation was lower than expected at 4.9 per cent in the year to January, though price pressures continued to build and will force the central bank to stick to its course of monetary tightening.
Economists had forecast a 5.3 per cent rise in consumer price inflation following a 4.6 per cent increase in the year to December.
"This is how I see it, though the market cheered on the softer-than-expected CPI market talk: It may provide a false dawn and should be considered with caution mainly because recent indicators and developments still signal that upside risk to inflation persists," said Connie Tse, economist at Foreacst PTE in Singapore.
In one sign of the accumulating pressures, the producer price index (PPI) rose 6.6 per cent in the year to January, accelerating from an increase of 5.9 percent in the 12 months to December, the agency said.
Economists had expected the PPI to rise 6.1 per cent in the year to January.
The National Bureau of Statistics also announced a major adjustment to the way it calculates consumer price inflation.
