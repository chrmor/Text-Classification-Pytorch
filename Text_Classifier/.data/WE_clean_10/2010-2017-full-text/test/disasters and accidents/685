Scores Feared Dead in Sinking off Libya
BENGHAZI, Libya — A boat packed with up to 250 African migrants trying to reach European shores sank Sunday off the Libyan coast, and most are feared dead, a spokesman for the Libyan Navy said.
Only 26 people have been rescued so far, said a navy spokesman, Ayub Qassem, adding that the boat sank near Tajoura, east of Tripoli, the capital.
“There are so many dead bodies floating in the sea,” Mr. Qassem said. The underequipped coast guard lacked the boats to carry out a full search for survivors, he added.
Migrants have been streaming out of North Africa, mostly Libya, in rickety boats in rising numbers for years. Many head for Italy; more than 100,000 have reached its shores this year, according to the Italian government.
