Spain gift bronze medal to Poland at the Qatar World handball tournament
Spain ended the Men's Handball World Championship without managing to win what would have been their third medal in a row, losing in extra time by 29-28 to Poland, who therefore won the bronze medal after a poor game by the Spanish side, as the tough semi-final they'd played against France had evidently taken its toll.
In the game that no one really wants to play - the third place play-off - the Spanish team showed that they were not in very good shape for a match like this.
This was clear as they went behind quite early on and took quite some time to turn the game round. When in the end it was within their grasp, they threw it away.
During extra time, they ran out of ideas and Poland seemed brighter and fresher, especially Michel Szyba, a player who had scored barely six goals throughout the competition, and yet who now hit eight against Spain. The last of his goals enabled Poland to take the match to extra time in the last second.
The sharpness Spain had displayed all the way through the competition had gone, and they gave the bronze medal away to Poland.
They have therefore failed to win a third medal in a row, and missed out on the right to organise one of the pre-Olympic tournaments. A bitter ending to the competition for a bunch of players who have given us, and will again give us, a lot of pleasure.
