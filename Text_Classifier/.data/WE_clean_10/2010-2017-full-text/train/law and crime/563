Bill Cosby Files Defamation Suit Against Women Who Accused Him
Demonstrating that he is still prepared to fight, Bill Cosby struck back on Monday against seven of the women who have accused him of sexual assault and defamation by, in turn, suing them for defamation and denying their allegations.
The filing, in federal court in Massachusetts, seemed to signal a new aggressiveness on the part of Mr. Cosby, who had kept a low profile for months as dozens of women came forward, accusing him of sexual misconduct and assault.
The papers, submitted in response to the defamation suit the seven women filed, accuse them of “malicious, opportunistic and false and defamatory accusations of sexual misconduct.”
Calling their behavior “outrageous and morally repugnant,” a lawyer for Mr. Cosby, Monique Pressley, said in a statement, “Mr. Cosby states plainly that he neither drugged nor sexually assaulted the defendants and that each defendant has maliciously and knowingly published multiple false statements and accusations from fall 2014 through the current day.”
