Thousands flee as wildfire bursts into Colorado city
A massive wildfire has swept through a residential area of Colorado's second most populous city, destroying homes and prompting 32,000 people to flee to safety.
The fire, which began in Waldo Canyon on Saturday, exploded into the Colorado Springs community of Mountain Shadows on Tuesday and set ablaze the mountains that rim the city 100 kilometres south of the state capital, Denver.
"This is a firestorm of epic proportions," Colorado Springs Fire Chief Rich Brown told a news conference late on Tuesday, before the fire surged again overnight.
Among the areas threatened was the US Air Force Academy, which evacuated two housing areas, a day before the scheduled arrival of 1000 new cadets, the academy said.
