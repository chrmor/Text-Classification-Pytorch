Trooper, Gunman Dead in Shooting at Greyhound Station in Richmond, Virginia
A state trooper and a gunman are dead after an "active shooter" situation at a Greyhound bus station in Virginia on Thursday afternoon, state police said.
"Itâ€™s with an incredibly heavy heart tonight that I announce to you the loss of Police Trooper Chad Dermyer," Virginia State Police Superintendent Steven Flaherty said at a news conference Thursday night.
Dermyer, 37, died as a result of sustaining multiple gunshot wounds during the Thursday afternoon shooting, Flaherty said.
Two civilian women were also injured during the incident, which took place around 2:45 p.m. ET Thursday afternoon at the bus station in Richmond, Virginia, State Police Spokeswoman Corinne Geller said at an earlier press conference.
Flaherty said Dermyer had been taking part in a police training mission before the shooting.
Dermyer, who was wearing a military-fatigue-style uniform, approached the man at the entrance to the bus station when the man pulled a gun and shot the officer at close range, Geller said.
Flaherty said the encounter lasted roughly 30 seconds and that the gunman shot Dermyer multiple times.
Two officers standing nearby returned fire and fatally struck the gunman, who died after being taken to a hospital, she said.
The two injured civilians were shot after the trooper, said Geller, who noted that a gun was recovered at the scene.
Dermyer was not wearing a bullet-proof vest at the time, Flaherty said. Police are encouraged, but not required to wear vests during such training sessions, he added.
Police have identified the gunman, whose address is not listed as in Virginia, but are not releasing his identity as they are still notifying next of kin, Flaherty said. The man has a history of charges against him, but investigators were still sorting through his convictions, he said.
Officials told NBC News that the gunman appears to have been mentally disturbed.
