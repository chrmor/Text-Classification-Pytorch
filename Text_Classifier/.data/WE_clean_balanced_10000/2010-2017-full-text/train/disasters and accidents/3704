Brazil hit by deadly floods and landslides
Landslides and floods triggered by torrential rain have killed at least 10 people in southern Brazil.
Among the dead were three children whose home was among several buried in the town of Novo Hamburgo in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
A man was electrocuted by toppled power lines in Sapucaia do Sul and a farmer died when a building collapsed on him.
Floods and landslides in January killed about 800 people in a mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro.
Civil defence officials said that the latest flooding also caused deaths in Igrejinha, Fazenda Vila Nova and Sapucaia do Sul.
Rescue workers were searching for two missing people after homes in Igrejinha were engulfed by mudslides.
Surrounding areas believed at risk from further landslides are being evacuated, officials said.
Flooding was also reported near Porto Alegre, state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, and about 100,000 residents there are reported to be without power.
