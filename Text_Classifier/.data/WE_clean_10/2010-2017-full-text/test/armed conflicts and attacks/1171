At least 18 Kurdish YPG members killed in Turkish air strikes in Syrial: monitor
BEIRUT (Reuters) - At least 18 Kurdish YPG fighters and media officials were killed in Turkish air strikes on a headquarters of the militia in northeastern Syria on Tuesday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.
The YPG, a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State, did not immediately give its own precise death toll.
Turkeyâ€™s military bombed the YPG and Kurdish militants in neighboring Iraq early on Tuesday, widening a campaign against groups affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
