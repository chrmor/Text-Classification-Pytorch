Sarabjit Singh to be cremated in his ancestral village in Punjab today
A special aircraft carrying the body of Sarabjit Singh, the Indian prisoner who died at a Lahore hospital today, landed in Amritsar shortly after 7:30 pm tonight. The lack of basic paperwork had delayed the plane's take-off from Lahore airport by over two hours. India is extremely upset about the delay.
