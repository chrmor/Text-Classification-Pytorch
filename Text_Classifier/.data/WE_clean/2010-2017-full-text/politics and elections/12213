Cartoonist sent to judicial custody on sedition charges
Popular Mumbai cartoonist Aseem Trivedi has been sent to judicial custody till 16 September on charges of sedition, which is a non-bailable offence.
Trivedi was arrested on charges of displaying "ugly and obscene content" and was produced before a Bandra court later this afternoon.
Trivedi has charges framed against him under the IT Act, as well as the 1971 National Emblem act.
He had also exhibited similar cartoons at an India Against Corruption rally in December 2011 at the MMRDA grounds, following which his website was immediately banned. He now hosts his cartoons here.
The police are also bringing charges relating to his displaying cartoons at the 2011 rally in Bandra today.
The cartoons which are grouped under the title, "cartoons against corruption" often feature derogatory depictions of politicians such as Digvijaya Singh and the Prime Minister. One of the cartoons also depicts the national Ashoka emblem as three wolves dripping blood from their jaws, with the title, "wolves with the signs of danger".
