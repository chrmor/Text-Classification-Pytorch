Fabio Capello resigns, FA begin new manager search: live
• Redknapp: "I haven't thought about England ... Spurs my focus" • Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney want Redknapp to take over • Tottenham director Sir Keith Mills "hopes Harry will stay" • Capello: "I cannot permit interference from the FA in my work" • Stuart Pearce to take charge for England friendly with Holland
16.55 We're signing off the live coverage for today. Thanks for company on another day of high drama for English football, and for all your contributions via email and Twitter.
16.40 Stuart Lancaster, who knows more than most about taking over a shambles of an England team on an interim basis and getting off to a winning start, has had some kind words for Stuart Pearce, whom he discussed international management with ahead of his own recent promotion:
He's not just an ex-footballer who's become a coach. He's far, far more than that. He is the ideal person to step in because he understands the culture of the environment and when you understand the culture you have the chance to help shape it.
It is a pretty unique situation where England football is at the moment. He is exactly the right person to step into an interim role.
16.25 Fabio Capello has spoken of his reasons for resigning from his position as England manager:
I acted the way I always have in football. I cannot permit interference from the FA in my work. I have always been clear who should manage the team and the dressing room, and who has to take decisions.
16.00 Everyone, it seems, wants Harry Redknapp to take charge of England. And sooner rather than later. Well, almost everyone...
In management, they reckon, it's better to be lucky than good. And if that's true, then the FA should appoint Harry Redknapp immediately ... But to say Tottenham's success is all down to Redknapp's god-like genius is off the mark ... The manager I'd like to see appointed is shrewd, passionate, experienced, available and has an unmatched record in tournaments. Guus Hiddink is lucky and good. He should lead England at the Euros.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Dalglish - Come on. Let's make an old man happy. Let's get Fergie to Wembley. &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=fergieforengland" target="_blank"&gt;#fergieforengland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
15.40 Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy understands why Capello took the decision he did, and, in a contrary move for which the Irish-Yorkshireman is rightly famed, refused to back Redknapp to succeed him, instead offering support to rank outsider Kevin Keegan .... what? ... oh, right.
The FA had one opinion and Fabio had another one and I admire Fabio in terms of standing by his principle if that is his stance. In terms of what he has done, he must feel very strongly about it to walk away from a team that have qualified for the European Championships.
In terms of who should replace Fabio, I hate going with public opinion so I'll say Kevin Keegan! I think Harry should get it. I just think if Harry wants it, he is the man who deserves it. He has been at Tottenham for three or four years and if ever there was a guy at the top of his game, it's Harry.
With all the stuff he has just gone through again, he must as tough as an old boot. It strikes me he has got everything needed to manage England.
15. 25 Sports blog Off The Post believe they have unearthed evidence that points towards Harry Redknapp having already been offered the England job:
15.15 Roy Hodgson is still in the frame for the vacant England manager's position. Just. What endorsement from the enduringly popular Steve Kean at Blackburn Rovers will do for his chances, you be the judges:
Harry's got all the people skills and how to deal with the players and a very good record, especially at Tottenham. I'd also say Roy Hodgson. Roy, when he was manager of our club, I think he was interviewed for the England job.
He's also managed national teams before and had experience of managing abroad so I also think he would be an excellent candidate.
15.00 So why did Capello feel he needed to take such drastic action when the FA removed his captain without consulting him?
Well, if research from Sport Development lecturer Dr Paul Davis of Northumbria University is to be believed (and I'm not saying it necessarily is), he may have felt like he'd "just had his arm cut off".
The study found that managers saw greater importance in the captain's role than simply wearing an armband and shaking hands before the game. They wanted the skipper to motivate, communicate, perform consistently, know the game and show good decision-making – all skills the managers themselves must be highly proficient in.
We found that in many ways the captain was to be an extension of the manager on the pitch. The manager would look to the captain to have good interpersonal skills and characteristics and also be honest and trustworthy. If you take the analogy of John Terry being Capello's extended arm on the pitch, then Capello may be feeling that he had his arm cut off by the FA.
Their rejection of the person he had selected to captain the side could be interpreted as a statement on his own ability to manage.
14.55 Making Redknapp manager would be a return to English values, the best of British back in the dug out, eh? Though it may surprise you to learn he was, in part, made in Amercia. Grant Wahl, from Sports Illustrated, explains:
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Grant Wahl - Where did Harry Redknapp (favorite to take England job) start his coaching career? With Seattle Sounders in '76 as player/assistant manager.&lt;/noframe&gt;
14.35 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has expressed his "sadness" at Capello's departure from the England post, so close to a tournament he qualified the team for:
When the decision came out from the FA, I said that the choice of captain is down to the manager. You [the manager] pick your team, you choose your captain.
I did not expect such an extreme situation but it looks like there was already some turbulence there and that was just the final straw. I am sad that Capello leaves four months before such an important competition, it is a big blow for England.
I have always been straight in [suggesting an Englishman should be next] - not because I think an English manager can do a better job than any foreign guy, just because you represent your country and it is better if the manager is from there. Especially in a big football country like England.
14.20 The Telegraph's ownJonathan Liew clearly has too much time on his hands:
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Jonathan Liew - The Pub Bore's Guide To Choosing The Next England Manager, in Venn diagram form &lt;a href="http://t.co/SngRHSj6" target="_blank"&gt;http://t.co/SngRHSj6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
14.00 Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas (who is probably a touch concerned about the managerial merry-go-round cranking up in to near top gear) has had his say on Capello's short goodbye:
It surprised me for sure. First it will be very, very difficult for the FA to find a manager with Fabio’s CV, because it is one of the best of the world. He has been a successful manager with most of the clubs he has managed.
It shows maybe a lack of communication between both parties. Whenever I speak, because I represent the club, I need the authorisation. And I’m not sure that was the case in the unfortunate chain of events that led to the parties being in disagreement regarding what was said to Italian tv or whatever.
It’s a very specific job. Exciting or course, and extremely demanding, under public scrutiny for most of the time. But hopefully a good solution will be found. The team is in the tournament which is the most important thing, there are big favourites for the job and big expectancy regarding Harry’s future. But it’s up to the FA to decide.
13.45 Redknapp was back in his natural habitat this morning. Not the Tottenham training ground, but, rather, leaning out of the open window of a car talking to Sky Sports reporters:
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Jonathan Liew - Does Harry Redknapp's car actually have a window?&lt;/noframe&gt;
13.40 Roy Keane has told Wayne Rooney to "keep his nose out" of the debate over the next England manager, after the Manchester United striker tweeted his support for Harry Redknapp to succeed Fabio Capello:
Wayne should keep his nose out of it. He didn't do enough on the pitch when Capello was manager.
Capello is a strong character and obviously thought his authority was questioned with John Terry losing the captaincy. You've got to admire him. He stuck to his guns. They went over his head, taking the captaincy off Terry. Obviously they've asked him to apologise and he's gone.
13.15 Henry Winter will be online in 15 minutes time for a live webchat to answer as many of your questions as possible on England, John Terry, Fabio Capello, the armband, Euro 2012, Harry Redknapp and all that.
You can get your questions in right now.
13.00 The FA may have been tight-lipped over possible long-term replacements for Capello but Mark Ogden details your runners and riders from Harry to Hiddink.
And you can have your say in our online poll:
Who should be England's next manager?
12.45 Some more on the Italian papers' view of the Capello sacking:
The inventors of football (even if they have not won a World Cup since Queen Elizabeth was a young woman), could have supported the Italian on one condition – that he scored successes and knew how to reverse history. Instead he was almost a disaster, with the horrendous World Cup in South Africa and the fear that the same dismal performance might be repeated at the European Championships. Before it became too late, they needed to free themselves of this encumbrance.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Jim White - What's in a name: both England rugby and football teams under temporary stewardship of blokes called Stuart...&lt;/noframe&gt;
12.37 A statement has been released from Fabio Capello via his son and agent, thanking everyone involved with England during his time in charge of the national team:
I would like to thank all players, staff and Football Association for the professionalism they have shown during my years as manager of the English National Team
A very special thanks to all the supporters: they've always supported the team and me in our job. I wish all of them every success in achieving all their sporting goals.
12.34 Paul Hayward was at the press conference today:
The incredible rise of Stuart Pearce continues. Bumped around and told to "stand up, sit down" by Fabio Capello in South Africa, the man known to fans as 'Psycho' is now manager of England (for one game), England U-21s and the GB Olympic Team.

12.33 The headline news from today's press conference, then. Stuart Pearce to manage the national team for the friendly against Holland ... Capello's time was expensive but not a mistake, according to FA Chairman David Bernstein ... preference for an English manager next but not a definite ... FA open minded about a working manager taking the role part-time to the summer.
12.30 "Is there anything that could have changed what happened yesterday. Did he want an apology? Did you want him to apologise?" Bernstein: "I can't read his mind so I can't answer that."
12.29 "Will popular opinion among players and managers feed in to decision over next manager [i.e. will you listen to Rooney and Ferdinand over Redknapp]?" Bernstien: "Of course we will take note of that but the process will look at a selection of candidates and we can't be driven by a few individuals' views"
12.27 "What lessons can be learned from the Terry case, should there be a code of conduct rather than flip-flopping on each issue as it arises?" Bernstein: "That's something we're working on."
12.26 "Was the Capello era an expensive mistake?" Bernstein: "It was certainly expensive, no one can argue anything other than that, but it wasn't a mistake."
12.25 Continuing with the FA press conference at Wembley....
"Have England been left in a mess without a manager or captain four months before the Euros?" Bernstein: "We're where we are. The person we appoint will have a knowledge of the England players."
12.24 "Could a working manager take on the England job part time until the end of the season?" Bernstein: "We have an open mind."
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Henry Winter - Bernstein" "Certainly was expensive, but not a mistake. Capello was a great manager for us, tho no one going to defend WC performance"&lt;/noframe&gt;
12.23 "Will the next England manager definitely be English?" Bernstein: "No, not definitely. There is clearly a preference for an English, or a British, manager."
12.22 "Did you go in to your meeting with Capello expecting him to be the England manager at the end of it?" Bernstein: "We went in to those discussions with an open mind..."
12.21 Alex Horne: "Capello thought the best thing was to offer his resignation. We thought the best thing was to accept."
12.20 Bernstein: "We didn't encourage Capello to resign. We had a frank exchange of views. During these things a feel for people's mood arises. After those discussions I went in to his office and he told me he wanted to resign."
12.18 "If Capello hadn't offered his resignation would he have been sacked?" "That's a hypothetical question and it just didn't arise. It was his decision alone." "Did the FA have to pay him off?" " I can't go in to that now."
12.17 Bernstein: "In the long term what we have done should be in the interest of the England team."
12.16 Bernstein: "We got the Terry issue absolutely right. Until the court's decision to postpone the hearing we thought the court would rule before the Euros and we could act then. The totemic aspect of the England captaincy meant it wasn't something we could go in to a tournament with hanging over us."
12.15 Capello's resignation was accepted due to matters arising from captaincy issue and Capello's interview on Italian TV. Was sacking him a possibility? "That never came up as an issue".
12.14 Redknapp's name raised for the first time. "I can't speak about individuals," says Bernstein.
12.13 Bernstein: "There is time for a new man to get in place and build up towards Euro 2012."
12.12 During questioning Bernstein says he regets what happens but it was ultimately Capello's decision to quit.
12.11 Bevington is now talking about Club England's long-term strategy. "We have to create an environment in which all players can express themselves and achieve success". That sort of thing.....
12.10 ..."Stuart Pearce to take charge of Holland friendly at the end of the month, after that the priority will be to find a long term manager"...
12.09 ...."we met with Capello and after a detailed discussion he offered his resignation"...
12.08 ..."we were surprised by Terry's trial being set for after Euro 2012 and made a swift decision over the captaincy. Capello was informed before the announcement. He was not happy but accepted it. On Sunday Capello conducted the TV interview [in which he criticised the FA over Terry decision] which caused uneasy feeling....
12.07 Bernstein: "There are moments when the board has to step up to the plate. Capello has had the full support of the board during this time..."
12.06 Praise for Capello over his qualifying record and dignity in the process, that "ended with a handshake"...
12.05 Bernstein starts by thanking his colleagues for support during "challenging" week...and flags up "football knowledge on the board", the one that went over the manager's head to strip John Terry of the captaincy...
12.00 FA press conference about to get under way. Facing the awkward questions will be Chairman David Bernstein, General Secretary Alex Horne, Managing Director Adrian Bevington and Director of Football Development Sir Trevor Brooking.
11.50 Italian media reaction to Capello's exit: His relationship with England was marriage that was never consummated
11.48 We've had our first shot on Sky Sport's News of empty chairs and untouched glasses of water in a Wembley conference room surrounded by England and FA logos. It can mean only one thing, we are minutes away from FA Chairman David Bernstein facing the press to explain Fabio Capello's departure from England. 12 minutes to be precise.
11.40 Tottenham's players started their usual training session at 11am at their base in Chigwell without their manager. Redknapp told the club yesterday that he would probably not be taking training today as he wanted to rest after his draining 13-day trial.
11.35 Proving that the crisis at Wembley is the only story in town today, in the House of Commons the Sports Minister Hugh Robertson took a moment to attack the outgoing Italian:
I think it is a very great shame that Fabio Capello has acted in the way that he has. If a player in his team had behaved in the way that he has behaved to the FA, he would have taken the toughest possible action, and I’m delighted that the FA have agreed with him that he should no longer be manager.
11.25 More from Redknapp on England, Tottenham and having "not even thought about" the national team job:
It wouldn't be right to focus on anything else other than Tottenham. That's my focus. Tottenham have been fantastic. The fans were great in the Wigan game.
I was shocked, I was surprised [by Capello's resignation]. We knew he would leave in summer. I didn't expect it to happen now.
11.15 As we wait for the FA's high noon press conference where David Bernstein will field questions over Fabio Capello and, you imagine, one or two about Harry Redknapp, take a moment to look back over both men's managerial career.
11.10 Redknapp has spoken to reporters leaving his house this morning:
I've never thought about it [the England job]. They [the FA] will make whatever decision they want to make and hopefully be right for the country. Spurs is my focus now.
11.00 Bolton's Owen Coyle is the latest Premier League manager to be asked his opinion on the vacant England job:
What (the FA) have to do now is make sure they get the right man for the job because I certainly believe England have a fantastic chance at the Euros. I can totally understand why the clamour would be for Harry Redknapp. I think when you look at the England squad, they have a terrific group of players who play at elite clubs and certainly know how the game needs to be played.
They will have been coached at the very highest level for many, many years. In my opinion, what England need is somebody to go in and get that spirit together, that camaraderie and to be a motivator. Harry Redknapp ticks every box, and he also has fantastic football knowledge. When you put that all together, there is no doubt he is a complete package.
The difficulty with that is that he has done such a fantastic job with Tottenham Hotspur. I have no doubt - for me, he would be the perfect choice, but I think Tottenham might have something to say about that.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Henry Winter - Judging by the newspapers, radio phone-ins, rolling TV &amp;amp; throng now heading into Wembley, interest in &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=eng" target="_blank"&gt;#eng&lt;/a&gt; remains huge. Club v country?&lt;/noframe&gt;
10.45 David Cameron spoke earlier on the pressing issue of the day. The economy? Syria? The weather...?
10.30 More of Alan Pardew's thoughts on the England job from our man in the North East, Luke Edwards:
As an Englishman I'm proud to be in that frame but it's not for me. I've got a little project here at Newcastle which is going well, the passion here and everything about the place is why I want to stay. I hope it's an Englishman, I think that's important this time.
10.25 If you see Paul Hayward today, please don't mention the 'i' word...
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - Not so long ago David Bernstein was that nice bloke at Man City. At noon today he will be the guy with the future of humanity in his hands.&lt;/noframe&gt;
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - And if anyone calls it the biggest job in football or the impossible job I'm going to lose it.&lt;/noframe&gt;
10.15 Not everyone was surprised to see Capello call time on his career with England once he had been undermined over the John Terry captaincy issue. Not Wigan manager Roberto Martinez, anyway.
I don't think it was a real shock. Fabio Capello, everywhere he has been, has been very supportive of his players. You would expect that that wasn't an easy issue for him to accept.
It is a real shame, I did feel Fabio Capello was creating something special going into the Euros. We are all aware of what happened in the World Cup and everyone tries to highlight that, but the reality is the England team has shown an incredible progression since Fabio Capello arrived.
10.10 Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand have nailed their colours to Redknapp's mast. But who do you want to see leading England to the European Championships this summer?
Who should be England's next manager?
10.00 Former England manager Graham Taylor says Redknapp is "made for the job" of leading the national team and believes the 64-year-old was at the right stage of his career to take on the challenge.
I just think that taking the England job is far better when you're coming towards the end of your career than when you're a young man. I think Harry is in many respects made for the job.
The public want him, the players want him, sections of the media want him, so that's how it looks at the moment.
09.45 Alan Pardew has been tipped in some quarters to one day manage England after turning Newcastle United in to a side challenging for a Champions League place. However, when asked about the job today he was quick to take himself out of the running:
It's not for me. Not even in the frame as far as I'm concerned, I want to make that clear. I'm in a really good project at Newcastle United.
09.40 Paul Kelso brings you up to speed an a dramatic day in English football that started with Harry Redknapp facing the possibility of jail time, had he lost his court case, and ended with him England manager elect.
Capello’s position had been in jeopardy since he gave an interview to Italian state television Rai on Sunday protesting at Bernstein’s decision to remove Terry. The interview posed a direct challenge to the FA chairman’s authority, which had been bolstered by his move against Terry following the adjournment of the Chelsea captain’s trial on charges of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand until after Euro 2012. Having taken that decision, and with the full support of the board to deal with Capello as he saw fit, Bernstein was not minded to back down, leaving a parting of the ways inevitable.
09.35 Tottenham fans were celebrating yesterday when Harry Redknapp was cleared of all charges in his tax evasion case. Some, like Stefan Miernik, are slightly uneasy this morning.
As a Spurs fan, I say jog on to the F.A. Harry is our manager, and if he wants to avoid being a total hypocrite then he should show some loyalty to the club who stood by him all this time. He said the same thing about Luka. I'm sure every Spurs fan is getting sick of this by now. It's been too long since we've done this well and we don't want it to end now. And yes, I do care more about Spurs than England.
09.30 Rio Ferdinand has given his blessing to Harry Redknapp.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Rio Ferdinand - I think we need an English manager now, we don't need anything else lost in translation....Harry Redknapp would be my choice by a distance.&lt;/noframe&gt;
But if England can't tempt the current Tottenham manager, Paul Gascoigne thinks they should turn to a former Tottenham manager.
If Harry didn’t want it and Spurs weren't willing to let him go I would give Terry Venables a shot again. With a shadow of a doubt. The man is just an unbelievable manager.
09.22 FA chairman David Bernstein was doorstepped by Sky Sports News this morning. He said more than Capello. But not much:
I have no comment before the press conference in three hours time. Will be saying all those things [how soon an appointment will be made] then.
But when asked about Redknapp taking over he could barely conatain a smile.
We'll see ... a long way to go ...
09.18 Sir Keith Mills, a non-executive director at Tottenham, says the club will wait to see what develops regarding Redknapp and the England job.
Our position has been clear - the fans want Harry to stay at Tottenham, the players and the coaches do, the board does, and we hope he does stay.
I think we're jumping the gun a little bit here. Whether Harry will be approached is not a foregone conclusion. If he is, then Harry has got a big decision to make.
09.10 Alan Smith sees the change of leadership as an opportunity for some fringe players to make their case for the European Championships this summer:
There will be uncertainty while the Football Association decide what to do next, but that is not a bad thing, because it will be accompanied with a sense of excitement about what could lie ahead.
There may also be players who will welcome a manager who treats players in a different way than Capello did. The Italian managed in a dictatorial way, but the disciplinarian approach doesn’t always work with players.
08.55 Everyone has an opinion of Capello, it seems. Even David Cameron:
I am sorry to see Fabio go. I think he was a good coach and a good man. I don't think he was right about the John Terry issue. You can't be captain with that question mark that needs to be answered.
England now needs a new coach and a new captain and I hope we can get on with that and make the best of the opportunity this summer.
Asked if Redknapp should take over, he said: The day when the Prime Minister picks the England coach will be a very bad day for football but I am sure we will find someone really good and I am sure that we will play well when the time comes.
08.50 Unconfirmed reports have Capello at City airport right now as attempts to leave England for the second day running.
08.45 Capello left London this morning under cover of darkness. When it was still dark anyway. Which to be fair it is until quite late during winter. But nonetheless, he wasn't in the business of facing the press or talking to people.
He has returned to Italy and has yet to give any word on his decision, other than to his former employers, except to say "I leave England and I will not say anything else."
Any quotes attributed to Italian media sources you may have seen are utterly made up.
08.40 Henry Winter, despite another crisis at Wembley of English football's own making, is in optimistic mood today. Things can only get better:
Light the beacons across the land, let the church bells ring out with joy and record in the annals of history that Fabio Capello’s final decision as England manager proved to be his best.
England were stagnating. On his watch. On £6 million a year. It was time for Capello to go. It’s time for the FA to go for Harry Redknapp.
08.35 Members of the England squad have been tweeting their thoughts since the news broke last night. Including Wayne Rooney, who may have more than one reason for wanting Harry Redknapp to leave Spurs midseason, no?
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Wayne Rooney - Gutted capello has quit. Good guy and top coach. Got to be english to replace him. Harry redknapp for me.&lt;/noframe&gt;
08.30 Paul Hayward looks back on what the FA got for a cool £50m spent on foreign coaches in recent years. Not a lot, being the general consensus:
In press conferences Capello was curt, high-handed and sometimes incoherent. His English never advanced beyond first base. All this would have been ignorable had England not embarrassed themselves in South Africa ...
... Few will feel they knew him well and almost no England player will mourn his departure. In that sense his resignation is immaterial. It may even improve England’s chances. It creates a vacancy that will have to be filled but it removes the sense that a false relationship was at the heart of the English game.
08.20 Good morning everyone. And welcome to the latest brave new dawn of English football. After being plunged once more in to what seems the perpetual crisis our national game exists in, hope, blind though it may be, appears to be casting seed on the fallow, unforgiving earth.
Fabio Capello has had enough and has resigned from a job that paid him handsomely but which he failed, unusually for a serial winner, to excel in. But wait, what's this? Harry Redknapp is an innocent man who is now all square with the crown and the tax man.
England expects. What can possibly go wrong, eh? Oh, right.
Stay with us through the day as we round up all the latest reaction and comment and bring you live coverage of the FA press conference scheduled for 12 noon today. And send in your thoughts, via email at steve.wilson@telegraph.co.uk or Twitter @TelegraphSport.
