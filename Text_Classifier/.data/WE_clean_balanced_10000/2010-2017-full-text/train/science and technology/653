Apple Worldwide Developers Conference
For those holding out for the iPhone 8, that device won't be coming until later. Apple used to introduce new iPhone hardware at this annual June conference, but it started holding back the new phone introductions to the fall with the 2011 release of the iPhone 4s. However, we may see some hints at the new phone via an updated iOS 11 user interface and new software that could take advantage of such hardware. We'll be sure to flag these hints over the course of the keynote address.
