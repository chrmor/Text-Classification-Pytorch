S. Korean warship changes Libyan destination to Tripoli
SEOUL, March 2 (Yonhap) -- A South Korean warship heading to Libya to help with evacuation efforts from the turmoil-torn country has changed its destination and will arrive in the capital of Tripoli later Wednesday (Korean time), officials in Seoul said. The 4,500-ton destroyer Choi Young, which had been in waters near Somalia for anti-piracy operations, was ordered last week to head to Libya to help evacuate South Koreans from the bloodshed in the North African nation.
