Ukraine Forces Repel Two Fresh Assaults on Donetsk's Airport
KIEV, Ukraineâ€”Ukrainian forces repelled two fresh assaults by pro-Russia rebels on the airport in the eastern city of Donetsk on Tuesday, a military spokesman said, as fighting for the strategic site showed no sign of ending despite a cease-fire signed nearly a month ago.
European Union diplomats, meanwhile, decided to keep sanctions on Russia in place while the truce deal is still being implemented.
