Pinewood Studio plans rejected by South Bucks Council
Plans for the Â£200m expansion of Pinewood Studios have been turned down.
The 15-year project would have seen the building of studios, stages and streetscapes at the site in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire.
Pinewood previously claimed if the plans were refused "significant harm" would be done to the UK economy.
South Buckinghamshire Council rejected the plans as an "inappropriate" expansion into green belt land.
A report to the council said it had received 254 letters supporting the plans.
But nearby parish councils opposed the plans as an expansion into green belt land.
Councillor Bill Lidgate, whose ward includes Iver Heath, said he was "delighted" the plans were rejected.
He said: "We're 87% green belt in South Bucks and those policies are jealously protected.
"The point people must understand is that Pinewood Studios do not make films, they rent out buildings."
Last year the government rejected a previous project, which included more than 1,000 homes, as it would be "inappropriate in the green belt".
The studios, home to more than 1,500 movies over 76 years, were used to film the latest James Bond instalment, Skyfall, as well as the Oscar-nominated hit Les Miserables.
The report said Pinewood Studios "recognises" the plans would see development of the green belt but added the "development is needed to maintain and expand UK film, television and screen-based industries".
Iver Parish Council objected to the plans because they would have a "harmful impact on the character of the area".
Fulmer Parish Council said: "Roads around the site are narrow and unsuited to commercial vehicles."
Those in favour included film directors Danny Boyle and Ridley Scott.
