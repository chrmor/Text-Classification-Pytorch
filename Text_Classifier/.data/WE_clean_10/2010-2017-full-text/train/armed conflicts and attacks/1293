Syrian Army recaptures Palmyra
The Syrian Armed Forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, managed today to fully recapture the ancient city of Palmyra following weeks of fierce battles with the Islamic State terror group, the Kremlin just announced.
Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, was briefed about the good news from Syria from Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.
The historical city was re-taken by the Syrian Army in last March. However, the ISIS terror group re-entered the city in December 2016.
Much of the centuries-old cultural heritage was destroyed by the death cult, wrecking Palmyra’s Roman theater and the legendary Tetrapylon.
