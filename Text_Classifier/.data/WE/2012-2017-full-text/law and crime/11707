Safeway Fined $10M For Illegally Dumping Electronics, Pharmaceuticals In California Landfills « CBS San Francisco
OAKLAND (CBS/AP) — The Safeway supermarket chain has been ordered to pay nearly $10 million for illegally dumping batteries, electronics and pharmaceuticals in California landfills.
Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley says the practice occurred at more than 500 Safeway, Vons, Pavilions and Pak`n Save stores and distribution sites throughout California for more than seven years.
More than 40 state district attorneys and two city attorneys united to sue Pleasanton, California-based Safeway Inc. A judge ordered the company to pay $9.87 million in a settlement approved Friday.
The settlement claims Safeway illegally disposed of aerosol products, ignitable liquids and other toxic, ignitable and corrosive materials as well as customer records containing confidential medical information.
Safeway adopted new procedures to reduce and dispose of hazardous waste. The company tells the Oakland Tribune it’s committed to helping protect the environment.
