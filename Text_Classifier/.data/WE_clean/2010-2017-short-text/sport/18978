In American football, a law enforcement official tells the Associated Press that in April 2014, he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fianc√©e in an Atlantic City casino to the NFL office. This contradicts statements made by several league officials, including commissioner Roger Goodell, claiming they had not received or seen the video before it became public on September 8. (ESPN)
