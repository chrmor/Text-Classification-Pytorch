Spanish nursing home orderly admits 11 killings
An orderly at a Spanish retirement home has admitted killing 11 residents, reports say.
Joan Vila, 45, said he poisoned them with bleach, an overdose of insulin or drugs at the home in the north-eastern town of Olot, Spanish media reported.
He had confessed to killing three residents "to end their suffering" when he was arrested in October.
He then told a judge on Tuesday that he had killed another eight, the Spanish news agency Efe reported.
The confession came 10 days after a judge ordered the eight bodies exhumed as part of an investigation into suspicious deaths at the La Caritat home.
Doctors first alerted police after they found burns to the mouth and throat of an 85-year-old woman who died last month.
Mr Vila then confessed he had killed the woman and two others by forcing them to drink bleach.
In his latest confession Mr Vila told a judge he killed another six with a mix of drugs and two from an overdose of insulin, Efe reported.
The newspaper El Periodico quoted Mr Vila's lawyer, Carles Monguilod, as saying that the first killing was carried out in August 2009, another later that year and the other nine this year.
Mr Vila, who worked weekends at the home, is currently being held in the psychiatric ward of a prison.
Mr Monguilod said his client acted out of "compassion... because they were suffering and he wanted to give them some peace".
Most of the patients were said to have been suffering terminal illnesses, including Alzheimer's, and had fevers or were disorientated.
