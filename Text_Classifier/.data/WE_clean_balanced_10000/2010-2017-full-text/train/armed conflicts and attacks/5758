Ricin Detected in Letter Sent to Senator Roger Wicker
Senator , Democrat of , told reporters after the Napolitano briefing that the letter had come from someone who frequently writes lawmakers. She said the person had been identified, but she declined to divulge the name.
Senator , Republican of , said: “Obviously, I’m concerned. It’s not just members concerned. It rarely gets to a member before it goes through a lot of staff, and that’s a big concern, obviously, for all of us. We’re very anxious to get more details.”
As a precaution, Senate post offices on Capitol Hill were shut down and will most likely remain closed for the rest of the week. Senators were told that there was no evidence of contamination inside the Capitol or on the grounds, but investigators were still looking into whether any similar envelopes had been sent to anyone in the House.
As Senator left Ms. Napolitano’s briefing, he said, “It’s now been confirmed that ricin was found in an envelope at the screening facility, which is off-site, not here at the Capitol.”
“I don’t have any information that it’s in any way connected with what happened in Boston,” Mr. King, an independent from , said. “It may just be an unfortunate coincidence.”
News of the discovery was reverberating outside Washington on Tuesday evening. Senators’ offices in their states, which do not have the same kind of mail screening that the Capitol does, were told to look out for suspicious packages.
The anthrax-tainted letters addressed to members of Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks were the first modern instance of bioterrorism to rattle Capitol Hill. The discovery of anthrax in a letter addressed to Senator , a Democrat from and the majority leader at the time, led postal inspectors and the F.B.I. to seize all mail on Capitol Hill, seal it in 55-gallon barrels and move it to a warehouse outside Washington.
