Icesave Pressure Increasing on Iceland‘s President
This morning representatives of the Indefence group met with President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson with more than 56 thousand signatures of Icelanders urging the President not to sign the law, thereby putting it to a national vote.
At least six hundered people gathered at Bessastadir, the President‘s official residence, this morning according to visir.is. They sang and carried torches.
After the meeting with the President Indefence spokemen said they were pleased. The President had not indicated how he would react, but many bloggers seem to assume that he will refuse to sign the law.
According to Indefense at least three members of Althingi who are supporters of the government have put their names on the list urging the President not to sign. This is surprising, considering the fact that only two government supporters voted against the bill in Althingi. Among those who supported the bill was Ásmundur Dadi Einarsson, chairman of Heimssýn, the coalition against Iceland joining to European Union.
