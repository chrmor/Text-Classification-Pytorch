Thousands of Syrian Kurds flee ISIL onslaught
Suruc, Turkey: Tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds have flooded into Turkey, fleeing an onslaught by the Islamic State group (also known as ISIL) that prompted an appeal for international intervention.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said more than 60,000 Syrian Kurds had crossed into the country since the frontier was opened on Friday.
The exodus was prompted by intense clashes between ISIL and Kurdish fighters trying to hold off an assault on the town of Ayn al-Arab, known as Kobani in Kurdish.
Since Tuesday night, ISIL fighters have been advancing on the town, hoping to secure control over a large swathe of Syria's northern border with Turkey.
