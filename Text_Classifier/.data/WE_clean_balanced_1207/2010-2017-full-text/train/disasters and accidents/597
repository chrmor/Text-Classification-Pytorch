Ex-Typhoon Vongfong heads off from Japan leaving one dead, injuring dozens
Typhoon Vongfong has headed off Japan's north-east coast, leaving one person dead, two missing and 93 injured after becoming the strongest storm to hit the region this year.
By this morning, it had weakened sharply and the Japan Meteorological Agency had downgraded it to a tropical storm.
The Agency said at its height, Vongfong packed winds of 110 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 145 kph.
Public broadcaster NHK said after the storm passed through western Japan, a 90-year-old man in Tottori prefecture was found dead in a field irrigation ditch, while one person each was missing in Ehime and Shizuoka prefectures.
Vongfong brought heavy rain to Tokyo throughout Monday night and caused traffic snarls for much of the nation on the last day of a three-day holiday weekend.
NHK said more than 600 flights were cancelled nationwide on Monday and more than 60 cancellations were expected on Tuesday.
On Tuesday morning in Tokyo, the sun had returned and the commuter train service was returning to normal.
NHK said more than 800,000 people nationwide were urged to leave their homes, while more than 150,000 homes lost power.
Tokyo Electric Power Co, the operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, said it increased water transfer and storage capacity to prevent an overflow of radioactive water being stored at the plant.
Meanwhile, Japan's Pacific League postponed a baseball playoff game in Osaka between the Orix Buffaloes and the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.
It was the first time a Nippon Professional Baseball playoff game had been cancelled because of a typhoon.
After being downgraded to a tropical storm, Vongfong was moving northeast at 65 kph, heading off the coast of the Tohoku region which was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
