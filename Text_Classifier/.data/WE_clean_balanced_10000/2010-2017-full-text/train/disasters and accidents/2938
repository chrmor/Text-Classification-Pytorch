Deadly bus crash at Miami airport
A bus has hit a bridge at Miami International Airport, killing two passengers and injuring many more.
Airport spokesman Greg Chin says the bus was travelling at about 20 mph (30km/h) in the airport's arrivals section when the accident happened.
The 32 people on board - members of a church group - were all affected.
Mr Chin added that buses were meant to travel through the airport's departure area, not the arrivals section, because it had a higher clearance.
The bus was too tall for the eight-and-a-half-foot (2.6m) entrance to the arrivals area, Mr Chin was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.
He also said the passengers were part of a group of Jehovah's Witnesses heading to Miami's West Palm Beach. The driver was thought to have gone to the airport by mistake, police said.
One passenger died at the scene and the other in hospital. Three of those injured are in a critical condition.
The bus was privately owned and typically used for tours, though it is thought all passengers were local residents, not tourists, a police spokeswoman told the Associated Press news agency.
