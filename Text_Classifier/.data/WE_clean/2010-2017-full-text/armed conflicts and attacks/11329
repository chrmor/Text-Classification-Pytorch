Fire breaks out at Journalists Syndicate
A fire broke out on Tuesday on the fifth floor of the Journalists Syndicate in downtown Cairo, and flames spread to the other floors. The building was evacuated and firefighters attempted to put out the blaze.
Sources told Al-Masry Al-Youm that the fire erupted when someone threw a cigarette on the floor. State-run Al-Ahram reported that four fire trucks were rushed to the scene and put out the fire.
