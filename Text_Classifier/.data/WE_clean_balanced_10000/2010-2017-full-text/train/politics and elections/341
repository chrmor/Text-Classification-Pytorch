Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will boycott the country's general election next month.
The military junta has confirmed that Ms Suu Kyi's house arrest will end just six days after the election is held.
The government says she is not allowed to run as a candidate, but they will allow her to cast a ballot on November 7.
But Ms Suu Kyi's lawyers say she has no party to vote for, because her National League for Democracy was dissolved by the military junta.
