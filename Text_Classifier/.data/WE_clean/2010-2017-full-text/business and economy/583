Euro-zone second-quarter GDP up 1%, tops forecast
LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Gross domestic product in the 16-nation euro zone expanded 1% in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year, the European Union statistics agency Eurostat reported Friday. GDP was up 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Economists had forecast a 0.7% quarterly rise and a year-on-year expansion of 1.4%. But much stronger-than-expected growth in Germany, reported earlier Friday, pointed to an above-forecast reading for the euro-zone GDP figure.
