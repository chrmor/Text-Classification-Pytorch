17 Saudi women win historic local council polls – Daily Pakistan
RIYADH (Web Desk) – At least 17 Saudi women won municipal elections in the conservative Islamic kingdom on Saturday, the first to allow female participation, local media reported on Sunday before all official results were announced.
The election was the first in which women could vote and run as candidates, a landmark step in a country where women are barred from driving and are legally dependent on a male relative to approve almost all their major life decisions.
Sabq.org, a news website affiliated with the autocratic monarchy’s Interior Ministry, reported that a total of 17 women had been elected in various parts of the country.
Some results had been announced on the official Saudi Press Agency, including the victories of four women.
