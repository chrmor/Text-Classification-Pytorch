4 die in renewed shelling of Syrian city
Government troops have continued shelling rebel-held areas in central Syria as the United States, Europe and Arab nations meet in Tunisia.
More than 70 countries will participate in Friday's "Friends of Syria" meeting, which is expected to press Syrian President Bashar Assad to agree to a ceasefire and allow for humanitarian aid to reach the areas that have been hardest-hit by his security forces.
In the run up to the conference, American, European and Arab officials said the group would likely impose harsher sanctions if Assad rejects the ceasefire and predicted that his opponents would grow stronger if he remained in power.
And in an effort to bring an end to the violence, the UN announced that former Secretary General Kofi Annan will be the joint UN-Arab League envoy to deal with the crisis.
In a statement, Annan said on Friday he would try to "help bring an end to the violence and human rights abuses, and promote a peaceful solution" in Syria.
He expressed hope the Syrian government and opposition groups will cooperate with him in his efforts.
