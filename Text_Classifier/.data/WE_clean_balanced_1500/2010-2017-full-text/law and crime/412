China Corruption Fight Extends to Top Officials in Beijing and Shanghai
BEIJING — President Xi Jinping’s sweeping crackdown on corruption has claimed senior officials in China’s two largest cities, the latest indication that Mr. Xi’s effort to consolidate power and sideline political enemies shows no signs of abating.
The officials included Ai Baojun, 55, a vice mayor of Shanghai who oversaw a prominent economic zone, and Lu Xiwen, 60, a senior Communist Party official in Beijing.
Mr. Ai, a former steel executive, led an experimental free-trade zone in Shanghai that Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Li Keqiang, had praised for its efforts to promote investment. Mr. Ai also helped oversee several high-profile projects, including the construction of a Disney resort expected to open next year.
Ms. Lu, a deputy party secretary, was head of the Communist Party school in Beijing for training and indoctrinating government officials.
