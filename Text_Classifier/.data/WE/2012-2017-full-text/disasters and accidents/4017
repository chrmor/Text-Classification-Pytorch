Train derails in N.J., spills toxic chemicals
A bridge collapsed in southern New Jersey early Friday, derailing a freight train and spilling carloads of toxic chemicals into a creek.
Emergency crews rushed to Paulsboro after at least two railroad tank cars were dumped into the Mantua Creek and began leaking vinyl chloride, sickening dozens of residents.
More than 40 people were treated at a local hospital, most for breathing problems.
Residents of Paulsboro, West Deptford and East Greenwich Township were told to stay inside until further notice after the crash.
Vinyl chloride is a colorless gas and known human carcinogen, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Exposure to it affects the central nervous system and can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headaches and giddiness.
The swing bridge, used daily by freight trains, buckled under the trains’ weight and toppled them into the Mantua Creek, which opens into the Delaware River.
A similar accident happened on the bridge in 2009. It was rebuilt the following year.
At least one of the train’s cars contained vinyl chloride and another was carrying ethanol, authorities said.
Conrail had recently been investigating complaints about the bridge making noise, State Senate President Stephen Sweeney said. His district includes Paulsboro.
Conrail did not return the Daily News’ request for comment.
