Uzbekistan Releases Political Prisoner After 21 Years
MOSCOW — An Uzbek detainee sometimes called the world’s longest-serving political prisoner by rights groups was released on Thursday, having spent 21 years behind bars on various pretexts and trumped-up charges.
The prisoner, Murod Juraev, got his start in politics during the late-Soviet thaw, becoming an opposition member of Parliament. But he wound up in prison after Uzbekistan used its newfound independence to reverse course and crack down on opponents.
“The last 21 years have been a living hell that Murod Juraev and his family should never have had to experience,” Steve Swerdlow, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. He added that the Uzbek government should now investigate allegations that Mr. Juraev, 63, had been tortured in prison, and release other detainees.
Mr. Juraev had been imprisoned since Sept. 18, 1994. A court initially sentenced him to nine years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government and his term was subsequently extended for violating prison rules, including improperly peeling carrots and failing to take off his shoes when entering a barracks.
