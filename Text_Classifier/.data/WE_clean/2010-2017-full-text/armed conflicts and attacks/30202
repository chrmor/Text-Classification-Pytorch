Three people, including a teenager, were injured after a gunman opened fire outside a metro station in the city of Lille in northern France.
Witnesses described how a gunman began shooting outside the station on Friday night before he fled the scene, according to Sky News.
The teen reportedly was shot in the leg while another person took a bullet to the neck. Local news outlet La Voix du Nord has reported that a third person has been taken to hospital.
None of the injuries sustained are life-threatening. Police are now hunting for the gunman who is still on the run.
The attacker's motive is also still unknown, but it is not believed to be terror-related. Local media reported the shooting may have been gangland-related.
However, France remains on high alert with a state of emergency still in place following a series of terror attacks. The most recent attack occurred at Orly Airport in Paris when a radicalised Muslim, who was on an official watch-list, shot a policewoman in the head at a road check before attacking a soldier.
