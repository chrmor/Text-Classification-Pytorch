Malcolm Turnbull introduces same-sex marriage plebiscite legislation to Parliament
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull made a spirited defence of his doomed same-sex marriage plebiscite as he introduced the bill to Parliament on Wednesday, saying "society would be stronger if more people were married".
At his most animated when berating Labor for its opposition to the public vote, Mr Turnbull argued a plebiscite was the best way to decide a matter on which Australians had such deeply-held personal convictions.
"We have to respect that it is a very big moral issue. It is an issue of conscience for millions of Australians," he said. "If ever there is an issue to be put to a plebiscite, this is one that can and should be, because it is a very straightforward question."
A year to the day since he toppled Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister argued that social attitudes to same-sex couples had changed rapidly in recent years and reiterated his personal support for gay marriage.
