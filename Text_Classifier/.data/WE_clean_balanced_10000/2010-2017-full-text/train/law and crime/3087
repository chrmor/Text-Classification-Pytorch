NC college lifts lockdown after report of armed man
GREENSBORO, N.C. North Carolina A&T State University has lifted a lockdown imposed after reports of a man with a rifle on campus.
The campus police chief said no gunman was found after a search of the campus, CBS affiliate WFMY reported.
The university updated its website Friday afternoon to advise students and staff that the lockdown was no longer in effect.
Prior to the lockdown being lifted, A&T spokeswoman Nettie Rowland said no shots had been fired and that police had a description of the suspect.
Eight Guilford County Schools that were on lockdown are also lifted, WFMY reported.
The historically black college has more than 10,000 students and more than 2,000 employees. Rowland said it also hosts scores of Guilford County high school students who attend an on-campus high school focused on math, science and technology.
