Colombia seizes 8.5 tons of cocaine from Clan Úsuga drug gang
BOGOTA, May 16 (UPI) -- Colombian police seized more than 8.5 tons of cocaine during recent operations targeting the Clan Úsuga, one of the South American country's most powerful drug gangs.
The cocaine seizure in the town of Turbo in Colombia's Antioquia state is being considered the largest drug bust in Colombian history. Several weapons were seized and at least four men were arrested, including one -- identified as "Micolta" -- who is charged with extortion and ordering killings.
"Congratulations Colombian police: Operation in Turbo seized the largest quantity of drugs in history. Crushing blow to criminals," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a statement.
The cocaine seizure follows the recent discovery of two million-dollar submarines that were seemingly used by drug cartels to smuggle cocaine.
