Investigation Launched In Deadly Fire In Russia's Bashkortostan
Investigations have been launched into a deadly fire at a rehabilitation center in Russia's region of Bashkortostan.
The fire on March 15 killed 12 people in a small building in Bashkortostanâ€™s central city of Sterlitamak that housed a rehabilitation center for addicts.
Bashkortostan's Emergency Ministry said that preliminary investigations revealed that the victims most likely died of smoke inhalation.
Bashkortostan's head, Rustem Khamitov, who visited the site, said an investigation was launched into why the only exit in the building was secured by a heavy iron door and all the windows in the premises were enforced with iron grids.
