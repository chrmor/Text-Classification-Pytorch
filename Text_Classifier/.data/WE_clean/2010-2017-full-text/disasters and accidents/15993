Plane belly lands in NY
Newark - An airline official says a US Airways flight with 34 people aboard was forced to make a belly landing at Newark International Airport after experiencing landing gear trouble. No injuries were reported.
US Airways spokesperson Davien Anderson tells The Associated Press that a turboprop plane that left Philadelphia shortly before 23:00 on Friday landed safely at Newark with its landing gear retracted at about 01:00 on Saturday.
Anderson said the flight, being operated by Piedmont Airlines, was carrying 31 passengers and three crew members. He says the plane circled Newark in a holding pattern while working to get the gear down. After several failed attempts to get the gear down, the plane landed on its belly.
Anderson says the passengers were evacuated to the terminal by bus. He says US Airways is co-operating with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.
