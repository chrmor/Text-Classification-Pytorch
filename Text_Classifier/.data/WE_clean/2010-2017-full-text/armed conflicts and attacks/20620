Kabul bomb hits Turkish embassy car
A suicide attack on a Turkish embassy vehicle in Kabul has killed at least one person, Afghan officials say.
The bomber rammed a vehicle carrying explosives into the car in the Afghan capital's diplomatic quarter, killing a Turkish soldier. The bomber also died.
The Taliban later said it carried out the attack, with a spokesman saying the target was "a convoy of US troops".
There have been sporadic attacks in Kabul recently. In November, a British embassy car was targeted by a bomber.
Five people were killed in that attack, including one British national.
Another attack took place in January, when a suicide bomber hit a European Union police vehicle, killing a passer-by.
Thursday's attack happened at about 08:00 local time (03:30 GMT) outside the Iranian embassy, which is next to the Turkish mission.
Eyewitness Mohammad Yousuf told the AFP news agency that the suicide bomber was in a Toyota sedan.
"He detonated himself causing a big bang, soon after the explosion there was black smoke everywhere," he added.
It is believed the convoy was picking up Nato ambassador Ismail Aramaz, who was staying at the Turkish embassy. He was waiting to be picked up.
However, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid later tweeted: "the purpose of today's attack in Kabul was a convoy of US troops - the embassy or any other country nationals were not objective [sic]".
This looks like a carefully planned attack, the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports.
