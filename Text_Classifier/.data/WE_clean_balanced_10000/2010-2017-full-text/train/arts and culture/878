Briton wins Man Booker International Prize for Korean translation
A 28-year-old British woman who began her translating career after being commissioned on Twitter has won the Man Booker International Prize.
Deborah Smith, who has said her first attempt at Korean translation involved "looking up practically every other word in the dictionary", has won for her work on The Vegetarian by Han Kang.
The pair will split the £50,000 jointly-won prize, the most prestigious award for translated fiction in the UK.
Smith only began learning Korean seven years ago after a lifetime of speaking only English, moving into professional translation with The Vegetarian.
She has previously called the novel her "big break", after making a name for herself on social media.
