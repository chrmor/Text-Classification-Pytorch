U.S. missiles kill 7 militants – USATODAY.com
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani intelligence officials say missiles fired from unmanned American spy planes have hit two vehicles near the Afghan border, killing at least seven militants.
Three intelligence officials said the strike on Sunday came in the Mana area of North Waziristan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The officials say the area is dominated by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander whose forces often target U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but they did not know whether his men were targeted.
A U.S. drone strike Saturday also in North Waziristan killed five Gul Bahadur allies.
Most Pakistanis feel the strikes violate the country's sovereignty and kill innocent civilians. The U.S. maintains they are directed against militants and necessary to combat groups like al-Qaida.
