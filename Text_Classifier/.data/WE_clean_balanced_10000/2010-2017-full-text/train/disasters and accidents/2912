Slovakia's Krasna Horka castle destroyed in fire
A massive fire has swept through one of the best-preserved castles in Slovakia, destroying much of the historic building.
Smoke was spotted billowing from Krasna Horka after the final tour of the building on Saturday, and it is thought many precious artefacts kept at the castle may have been lost.
