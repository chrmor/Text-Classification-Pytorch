German award ceremony cancelled after outcry over prize for Putin
The organizers of a political prize in Germany have cancelled their annual award ceremony this year after their decision to honor Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ignited a public backlash among former award recipients and German politicians.
The Quadriga Prize, organized by the group Werkstatt Deutschland, honors four figures every year "whose thoughts and acts are built on values, values which conduce vision, courage and responsibility," according to Quadriga's website.
Quadriga's board of trustees had decided to honor Prime Minister Putin for "his service to the dependability and stability of German-Russian relations." The prize is awarded on October 3 every year, the day Germany celebrates the reunification of east and west after a generation of Cold War division.
Former president of the Czech Republic and previous Quadriga recipient Vaclav Havel had threatened to return his prize should Putin be honored. Germany's Green Party Chairman Cem Ã–zdemir and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales had declared their resignation from Quadriga's board of trustees in protest against Putin receiving the award.
