Consecutive blasts in Iraqi city kill 10
At least 10 people were killed and 70 wounded Sunday in four consecutive explosions in the city of Karbala, Iraqi officials said.
Karbala is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Baghdad.
All four blasts targeted civilians on their way to the Directorate of Travel and Nationality, police said.
Sunday, the beginning of the work week in Iraq, is a busy day at the office that issues passports and travel documents.
Two of the bombs were hidden in motorcycles; two others were roadside bombs, police said.
