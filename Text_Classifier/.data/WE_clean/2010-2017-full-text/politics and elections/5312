Tunisia disbands party of ousted president
Tunis - A Tunisian court on Wednesday dissolved the party of longtime autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who was ousted in a popular revolt.
Pro-democracy activists have demanded the dismantling of the Democratic Constitutional Rally, or RCD, since Ben Ali was driven from power on January 14 following weeks of protests. Tunisia's protests led to uprisings across the Arab world.
Under Ben Ali, Tunisia was effectively a one-party state, and a quarter of the 10 million population was a member of the RCD. His regime quashed political dissent and independent media, while guaranteeing economic growth and a stability that drew foreign investment and European tourists in droves.
The protests in December and January changed all that, and the interim government is working now to try to calm unrest and dismantle remnants of the old guard.
The RCD party's activities were suspended after Ben Ali left, and on Wednesday a Tunis court formally dissolved it. On Monday, the new prime minister formed a new government and abolished a much-hated police force blamed for political repression.
Members of the interim government quit the RCD after Ben Ali's ouster, seeking to distance themselves from his era.
But some protests have continued, and protesters continued to demand the dissolution of the RCD. - Sapa-AP
