Russians Say Iranian Reactor Has Damage to Cooling Pump
Russia on Monday explained why fuel is being removed from a nuclear reactor in Iran, delaying plans to start up the giant plant this month. The Russian account, the first official rationale, came after experts last week offered theories of the failure ranging from a startup glitch to foul play.
In a statement, Russia’s state nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, which is building the reactor in Bushehr, Iran, said it found damage to one of the reactor’s four main cooling pumps. That breakdown, it said, necessitated removal of the fuel core and an inspection of the reactor and its fuel assemblies to make sure they harbored no metal particles or chips. The detection of metal shards would prompt a thorough cleaning and, according to one official, a startup delay of up to two months.
Michael L. Corradini, a nuclear engineer at the University of Wisconsin, said that metallic debris whirling through a reactor’s cooling water posed no danger but that it would act as an abrasive that caused wear and tear, shortening the reactor’s life.
“It’s an operational issue,” he said in an interview. But while not suggesting an impact on safety, Dr. Corradini called the breakdown of the pump “not an ordinary occurrence at all.”
On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran told inspectors last Wednesday that it was planning to unload nuclear fuel from the reactor in Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf. Iran gave no explanation.
