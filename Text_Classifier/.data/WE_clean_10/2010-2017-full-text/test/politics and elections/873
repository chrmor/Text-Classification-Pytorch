CNN projects Romney win in New Hampshire, battle heads to S. Carolina
"If he can't come close to 50% here, it's very unlikely he can sweep the nomination," Gingrich told reporters in Bedford. "And I think that gives the party time to take a deep breath, look at his record and begin to realize that maybe this isn't the right guy to run against Obama."
"I like being able to fire people who provide services to me," he said. "You know, if someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say, 'You know, I'm going to go get someone else to provide that service to me.' "
Romney Communications Director Gail Gitcho said opponents are taking Romney's remarks out of context -- a point on which Gingrich and Paul defended him Tuesday. But the attacks have fed the image of Romney that his GOP opponents and Democrats have pushed: That he's a wealthy businessman who can't connect to average Americans.
"The language was a little bit clumsy and open to misinterpretation and that might raise some questions about whether or not he's the right person to debate Barack Obama, which I think is an essential characteristic for this fall, but nonetheless, I thought it was unfair to suggest that he actually liked firing people," Gingrich said.
