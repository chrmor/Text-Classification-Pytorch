Israel's Press Office apologises for what The Jerusalem Post dubbed "Bra-Gate" - the security screening of several international journalists forced to remove their underwear and denial of entry to Al Jazeera producer Najwan Simri Diab after she refused to remove her bra. Najwan Simri Diab says she did not wish for an apology, only to be assured that it won't happen again. (Sify) (The Jerusalem Post) (Ynetnews) (Al Jazeera)
