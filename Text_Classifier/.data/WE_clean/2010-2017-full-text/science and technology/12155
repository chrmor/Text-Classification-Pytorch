A landmark in the understanding of the human genome
The results of the ENCODE project are presented in 30 papers, published simultaneously in Nature, Genome Research and Genome Biology, and collected here. You can discover the project’s results in the conventional way, by visiting individual papers, or you can engage with the material by following ‘Threads’, each one dedicated to a theme discussed in more than one paper.
