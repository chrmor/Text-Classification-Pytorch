More than 200 protest in eastern Saudi Arabia - activists
RIYADH, March 11 (Reuters) - More than 200 protesters took to the streets on Friday in the Saudi Arabian city of Hofuf, two activists told Reuters, responding to a call by online social networks for protests in favour of political reform.
Hofuf, a major urban centre in Saudi Arabia’s oil rich Eastern Province close to the Ghawar oil field, has seen scattered protests by minority Shi’ites in the last two weeks.
