Sevilla appoint Emery as Michel successor
Sevilla have wasted no time in appointing Unai Emery as their new coach following Michel 's dismissal earlier on Monday.The Basque trainer has agreed an 18-month contract with the Andalusians and will take charge of his side's Copa del Rey clash against Zaragoza on Wednesday.Emery has been unemployed since he was sacked by Spartak Moscow in November following the Russian giants' humiliating 5-1 home defeat to arch-rivals Dynamo.Prior to his spell abroad, the 41-year-old made his name at Almeria, where he took the club to La Liga at the first time of asking in 2007, before guiding them to a ninth-placed finish in Spain's top flight a year later.His work did not go unnoticed as Valencia named him as Ronald Koeman's successor in 2008, but despite finishing in a Champions League place in each of his four seasons, he was axed by Los Chein the summer.Sevilla sit 12th in the table, having accumulated 24 points from 19 matches so far this term.
