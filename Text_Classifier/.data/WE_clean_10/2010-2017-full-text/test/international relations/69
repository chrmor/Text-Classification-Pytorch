Report: 3 Chinese fishermen released from detention in South Korea
(CNN) -- Three Chinese fishermen were released Saturday after being detained in South Korea, Yonhap news agency reported.
The three were arrested last week after their vessel collided with a South Korean coast guard vessel.
One fisherman was killed in the collision between a 63-ton fishing boat and the larger coast guard vessel, South Korea's news agency reported.
The collision occurred in waters about 72 miles off South Korea's coast.
South Korean authorities said it was illegal for the men to fish in that area but decided not to indict them, Yonhap reported.
The detention of the the fisherman had caused a diplomatic row between China and South Korea.
