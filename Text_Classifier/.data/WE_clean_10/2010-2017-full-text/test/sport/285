N. Korea wants to co-host Winter Games with S. Korea: official
TOKYO, July 13 (Yonhap) -- North Korea would like to co-host the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in South Korean alpine town of PyeongChang, a senior North Korean sports official said Wednesday. Jang Ung, a North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), said it was "positive" for Asia to host only its third Winter Games. When asked about the possibility of sharing some events with PyeongChang, Jang replied, "I hope so."   "The political and military situations between the Koreas aren't good, and they have to be improved," Jang said. "Otherwise, they could influence the Olympics."   Jang arrived in Tokyo to attend the general assembly of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).
