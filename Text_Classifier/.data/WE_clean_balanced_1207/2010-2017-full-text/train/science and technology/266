One is an adult male in his 40s.Similar to the first victim - a 36-year-old pregnant woman - the 32-year-old pregnant woman, identified as “A” was hospitalized on April 21 complaining of a severe cough and difficulty breathing and was placed in intensive care after developing pulmonary fibrosis, or scarring of the lungs. The doctors were able to save the baby by inducing labor, just like the first victim, according to the KCDC. The KCDC said all eight patients were hospitalized to receive treatment for various conditions suspected to be caused by the same unidentified virus. All of them initially received treatment at different clinics, but were later transferred to Asan Medical Center in Seoul. Four patients remain hospitalized. Two were released after receiving lung transplants, the KCDC said. The KCDC said it has been checking 43 university hospitals throughout the country to see if other patients are suffering from similar symptoms. The KCDC is waiting for DNA results of the virus.
