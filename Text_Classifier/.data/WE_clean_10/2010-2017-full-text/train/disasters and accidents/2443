"We've got the best of the best looking, and that's what we want to do," he said. "I want to count up all my citizens and all my firefighters."
Pastor Lester Adams said he met with a family that was shattered by the explosion. The mother had part of her ankle missing and her feet were crushed, he said. Her daughter had cuts and her son had to get six "staples" in the back of his head.
CNN affiliate WOAI "They went to check and see what was going on. They went out in front yard and (the) blast came from the back," he told CNN affiliate WOAI . "If they'd stayed in the house they would have probably been killed because their house collapsed."
"We didn't know exactly what it was," he said. "The forecast said a line of thunderstorms was going to come through. My wife and I looked up and wondered, 'Did it get here six hours early?' "
Authorities closed schools for the rest of the week and said after that, they will probably depend on temporary buildings and schools in other districts for a while.
Separately, the plant had informed the Environmental Protection Agency that it presented no risk of fire or explosion, according to The Dallas Morning News. It did so in 2011 in an emergency planning report required of facilities that use toxic or hazardous chemicals.
