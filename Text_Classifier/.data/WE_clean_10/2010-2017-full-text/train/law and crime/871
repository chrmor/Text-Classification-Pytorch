China court 'accepts first HIV job discrimination case'
A Chinese man has filed a lawsuit alleging he was denied a job because he has HIV.
State media say this is the first time that such a discrimination case has been accepted by a Chinese court.
The man said he had passed written tests and interviews for the teaching post in Anhui province.
But he was turned down after medical screening revealed his HIV status, China Daily said.
The newspaper reported that the case will be heard by a court in Anqing city, in Anhui province.
The plaintiff, a recent graduate, was not asking for compensation but wanted to be given the job, it said.
A lawyer for the plaintiff told the BBC that he would defend his client under existing Chinese laws.
"The state already has laws and regulations forbidding discrimination against HIV carriers when they apply for jobs," Zheng Jineng said.
"But the actual practise by some government departments and employers are in direct conflict with the laws.
"The fact that the People's Court has accepted the case indicates that the rule of law in China is progressing."
Officials say an estimated 740,000 Chinese people are living with HIV/Aids.
Many face discrimination in employment, education and healthcare because of the stigma attached to the virus.
