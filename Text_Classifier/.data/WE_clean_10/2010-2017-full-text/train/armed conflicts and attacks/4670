Pentagon Course Taught “Total War” Against Islam
New details have been revealed on a military course recently cancelled by the Pentagon for teaching senior military officers the United States is at war with Islam. According to course materials obtained by Wired magazine, the class instructor — Army Lt. Col. Matthew Dooley of the Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia — taught that the United States will need to fight a “total war” against the world’s Muslims to protect the nation. Dooley also instructed that the United States should “[take] war to a civilian population wherever necessary” and apply the “the historical precedents of Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki” to Islam’s holiest cities, bringing about “Mecca and Medina[’s] destruction.” Dooley also told his pupils, “By conservative estimates, a staggering 140 million [Muslims] … hate everything you stand for and will never coexist with you, unless you submit [to Islam].” In addition, Dooley’s course declared international laws protecting civilians are “no longer relevant” in the fight against Islam. A presentation from July 2011 declared: “This barbaric ideology will no longer be tolerated. Islam must change or we will facilitate its self-destruction.” Finally, Dooley instructed his students, “Remember — we are at war. Act like it. You are part of a resistance movement, not a social club.” Dooley’s course was suspended last month, but he remains on staff at the college.
