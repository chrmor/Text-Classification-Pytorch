New video shows Chavez, Castro meeting in Cuba
Venezuelan television is airing extended video and sound of President Hugo Chavez's meeting yesterday with Fidel Castro in Cuba. More than 10 minutes of footage shows the two in a garden chatting amiably about old times and a newspaper article about Cuban school uniforms. It then cuts to them seated indoors having an animated conversation. The Venezuelan president appears lucid and in good humor, his usually loquacious self. Chavez underwent surgery in Cuba two weeks ago and had been unusually quiet since then, spurring speculation he might be seriously ill. Allies insist he is firmly in control of the country and improving from his operation. The footage was broadcast Wednesday.
