Gian Piero Gasperini given the chop by Palermo after latest defeat
Palermo coach Gian Piero Gasperini has been sacked following the club's 2-1 loss to Atalanta on Sunday, which leaves them at the bottom of Serie A.
The defeat means Palermo have failed to win any of their last nine league games and are four points adrift of safety.
Asked about the future of 55-year-old Gasperini after Sunday's game, president Maurizio Zamparini refused to back him and said he needed to consider his future.
"Despite being aware of the difficult situation that the team is going through, I am certain we have a squad that will save itself," he told the club's official website after the match.
"I will take a night to reflect and decide what is best for Palermo."
On Monday, the Sicilian club, who will now seek to appoint their third coach of the campaign, confirmed the sacking of Gasperini. He was only appointed in September after the dismissal of Giuseppe Sannino.
Since Gasperini's arrival, Palermo have won only three matches, while drawing seven and suffering ten defeats.
According to the latest reports in Italy, Zamparini favours former Catania coach Pasquale Marino, while sporting director Pietro Lo Monaco - who may yet also face the sack - prefers Alberto Malesani.
