Wales 8 France 9: match report
How rotten. How unfair. Who could possibly raise a glass to salute France for reaching their third Rugby World Cup final? Even the players’ mothers must have thought twice about it.
There was neither merit nor glory in their victory but there was finality. They are through, and the game should weep.
Poor Wales. How the soul bled for them, for their heroic grandeur in not just surviving for 62 minutes with 14 men but for playing all the rugby. It was a ludicrously knee-jerk decision by Alain Rolland to dismiss Sam Warburton for a tip-tackle, one that completely ruined the game.
Why didn’t he wait and consider? He was too quick on the draw. Yellow, yes: red, no. Any match, let alone a World Cup semi-final, is for the players and the fans, not for the hidebound detail of disciplinary protocol. The contest, as well as the spectacle, was grievously scarred by Rolland’s pedantry.
As for French flair? Forget it. This was l’anti-jeu, the negation of all that rugby should be about. There was no grace, no soul and no ambition.
They reduced the game to its bare bones, taking no risks, refusing to chance their arm and simply kicking, and not very well at that. They were fretful, crabby and utterly without charm. They’re welcome to their final.
That France made over twice the number of tackles that Wales made (126-56) shows the paucity of the French approach. Given that the Welsh line-out was fragile, that the scrum was under the cosh after tighthead Adam Jones, was forced off after just 10 minutes, Wales did well to generate any sort of momentum from such little ball.
But they did, nobly and defiantly, rallying themselves after the shock of the dismissal, spurred by their sense of each other as well as by the realisation that they were facing a bunch of scaredy-cats. But the sporting gods were to deny them. Justice was nowhere to be seen at a subdued Eden Park.
Wales might well have sneaked home no matter the forces ranged against them. They missed 11 points from three penalty shots at goal and a conversion attempt. They were denied only by the narrowest of margins after Stephen Jones’s conversion of Mike Phillips’s 59th-minute try hit the nearside post.
Leigh Halfpenny had a pot from a metre inside his own half with four minutes to go. It dipped just under the crossbar. Where was a favourable gust when you needed it? In the frantic closing stages, Wales went through 27 phases but could not engineer a final pot at the posts. The fates are a miserly bunch.
You might argue that missing kicks shows a lack of skill. And you would be right. Wales did have their chances but could not take them. If it were just a matter of these blemishes settling the outcome, then so be it. But matters were shaped by another’s hand.
How much blame can be attached to Wales’s young captain? A fair bit, for he overcommitted to the type of tackle that has been outlawed for some while. Warburton knows that there is zero tolerance and he would have deserved rebuke for getting sin-binned.
Wales, already under duress after the loss of Adam Jones to a calf strain, might well have imploded at the sight of their talismanic leader trudging to the sidelines. But they didn’t. They kept their nerve and they held the line, not that France came remotely close to threatening it.
There were some magnificent rearguard performances to savour: from 20 year-old No 8, Toby Faletau to the battling Phillips at scrum-half, who strove and urged, giving his side hope from unlikely circumstances when he arced past the outstretched arms of lock Pascal Pape to score midway through the second-half. Phillips managed to touch down almost halfway to the posts. It was not a difficult conversion but Stephen Jones must have had its significance on his mind for he pulled it slightly, thudding into the woodwork.
It felt like the miss might have been important at the time and so it proved. Jones had replaced James Hook early in the second half as Wales realised that they needed territory. It was Jones’s adroit kick deep that teed up the position from where Phillips scored.
It was all to come to naught. Wales had the plaudits, France had the booty.
They are the first team to get this far with two defeats in the pool stage. They have been riven by discord and lambasted for the divisive comments of their coach, Marc Lièvremont. Small wonder that he waved away criticism of his team’s style. He had found vindication through the result and will now seek to bring the Webb Ellis Cup to France for the first time.
France lost to New Zealand in the augural World Cup final in 1987, and to Australia 12 years later. Revenge would be sweet indeed but on this form you can only see the winner coming from the southern hemisphere.
As ever, there was plenty to admire in the all-consuming play of captain Thierry Dusautoir and the cleverness of scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili. He ceded kicking duties to fly-half Morgan Parra who slotted three penalties from three attempts. Both he and Jones fluffed dropped-goal chances.
Parra contributed the only decent French break when he brushed past an impeded Jamie Roberts early in the second-half. There was precious little else to savour. This is not a gilded generation of French players but they have a chance to claim a historic accolade. They will have to show more if they are to trouble either of their possible opponents, and much more if they are to take hearts and minds with them.
Wales had a certain something within their grasp. It was snatched away on a technicality. Rolland was right by the letter of the law. Well, damn the letter of the law. We have all been deprived as a result.
