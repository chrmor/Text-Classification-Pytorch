Wehby Ad Highlights Medical Career
Pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby (R) is “launching a statewide TV ad on Wednesday highlighting her support for small-business-friendly policies.” It’s her third ad of the general election, produced by FP1 Strategies.
“As a doctor I was taught to do no harm,” Wehby says. “But day after day, I see policies coming from Washington that are hurting Oregon’s small businesses and costing us jobs.”
The campaign has not released the size of the buy, but reported very little cash on hand in its last FEC filings. (Roll Call)
