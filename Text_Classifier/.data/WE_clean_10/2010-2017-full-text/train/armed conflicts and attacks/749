No chance of Gulf style riots taking place: China
BEIJING: Chinese government has dismissed chances of West Asia style revolution in the Communist nation, saying it has brought development to the masses, even as it has stepped up security to avert attempts by dissidents to stir up protests. Recent riots in the Middle East and North Africa will not be repeated in China as the government is doing a good job and taking people's demands seriously, Zhao Qizheng, spokesman, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body told media. "Some media have said the problems in the Middle East will infect China, and that there have been such signals in China. I have said explicitly, with confidence, that such comparison is very absurd and does not match the facts," he was quoted in the official media here today. As for social problems such as surging housing prices and the deepening income gap between rich and poor, Zhao said the government has made wise decisions, though they need time to show effect. "We are to build 10 million apartments in one year, can you hear about that in any other country around the world?" he asked adding that China plans to build 36 million government-subsidised apartments in the coming five years, including 10 million in 2011, so more apartments will be available for low-income residents. "So be relieved, that (the riots) will not happen," he said.
