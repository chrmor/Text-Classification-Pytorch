Nelson Mandela has 'successful' procedure to remove gallstones
The 94-year-old former president and anti-apartheid leader underwent the operation early on Saturday after a week in hospital suffering from a recurrent lung infection.
Doctors had wanted to treat that infection before putting him through the endoscopic procedure to remove the gallstones, the government said.
A statement, which referred to Mr Mandela by his clan name, said: "The procedure was successful and Madiba is recovering." It referred to Mandela by his clan name as a sign of affection.
Mr Mandela, revered for being a leader of the struggle against white rule in South Africa, served one five-year term as president before retiring from public life.
It was the first time there had been any suggestion that he required surgery in addition to treatment for his chest problem.
Two days earlier the authorities offered another reassuring report on his condition, saying that he had "made progress" in overcoming a lung infection and doctors "are satisfied with the way he is responding to treatment".
This has become the longest continuous period Mr Mandela has spent in hospital since 2001, when he underwent seven weeks of radiotherapy after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In January last year, the former president spent two nights at a Johannesburg hospital, apparently for the same lung condition that was troubling him last week.
In February, he spent a night in hospital after complaining of abdominal pain.
Mr Mandela's state of health is being closely watched in South Africa and around the world.
The government has carefully controlled the flow of information, ensuring that he is cared for in a military hospital and releasing nothing aside from brief daily updates on his condition.
