Five people have been killed and three wounded when unknown gunmen opened fire on a grocery store in Thailand's troubled Muslim-majority south, police said.
Assailants with assault riffles sprayed bullets into a crowd of people who had gathered in front of the shop for early morning exercises in insurgency-plagued Pattani province.
"Five people died instantly and three were injured, one of whom is critically wounded," a police report said.
In a separate attack, a 49-year-old Muslim was found dead with his throat cut in Pattani on Thursday morning. Police said he had also been hit over the head with a blunt object.
Shadowy Islamic insurgents have waged a violent campaign in Thailand's southernmost region bordering Malaysia since early 2004, leaving more than 4,400 people dead, including both Muslims and Buddhists.
Fighting appears to have intensified recently. A bomb attack in Yala province killed nine villagers last week and an unusually brazen attack by armed rebels a week earlier on a military base killed at least four soldiers.
Thailand extended emergency rule on January 18 in most of the Muslim-majority region for another three months, despite rights groups' concerns about the powers given to the military.
