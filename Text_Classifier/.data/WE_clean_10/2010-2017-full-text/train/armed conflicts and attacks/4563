Qatar embassy suspends mission in Syria
Cairo/Damascus: Qatar’s embassy in Damascus has suspended its mission after government supporters attacked the building housing it.
A Syrian employee at the embassy told Al Watan newspaper: "Members of the Qatari diplomatic mission told us that work in the embassy is suspended and all diplomats and its consular affairs section will leave for Qatar."
Last week, supporters of the Syrian government threw stones, eggs and tomatoes at the embassy in protest against the Doha-based Al Jazeera's coverage of the unrest.
