In the U.S., the Chicago Cubs defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 6–4 in Game 4 of their National League Division Series (NLDS), winning the best-of-five-game series 3–1. The Cubs, who clinched a postseason series at their home for nearly a century, Wrigley Field, for the first time ever, move on to the best-of-seven 2015 National League Championship Series. The series opens on October 17 at the home park of the winner of the other NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets. (AP via ESPN)
