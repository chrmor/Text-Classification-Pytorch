Drone strike kills Al Qaeda operative in Yemen
A senior Al Qaeda official wanted by the United States and a local leader of the militant group's affiliate Ansar al-Sharia have been killed in a drone strike in central Yemen, tribal sources said.
Nabil al-Dahab, leader of Ansar al-Sharia in Yemen's Al Bayda province, was killed along with four other Al Qaeda members, including Shawki al-Badani.
Badani was a leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who is wanted by the United States.
The US state department designated Badani a "global terrorist", saying he was linked to at least two plots against the US embassy in Sanaa and a 2012 suicide bombing in the Yemeni capital that killed more than 100 soldiers.
A posting on the state department website said the Yemeni government had offered a $100,000 reward for information about Badani. It also reported Yemeni authorities described him as one of "the most dangerous terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda".
The US has acknowledged using drones in Yemen but does not comment publicly on the practice. Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Yemen were among the most active wings of the network founded by Osama bin Laden.
Drone strikes have killed at least 10 suspected Al Qaeda militants this week in central Yemen, where fighting between members of Ansar al-Sharia and rebel Shiite Muslim Houthi fighters also killed 10 people, tribesmen said.
Fighting has flared in different parts of Yemen since the Houthis rose to dominance in recent months, threatening the fragile stability of a country that borders Saudi Arabia.
Houthi forces took over Sanaa in September and fanned out into central and western Yemen, a move which antagonised Sunni tribesmen and Al Qaeda militants who regard the Houthis as heretics.
