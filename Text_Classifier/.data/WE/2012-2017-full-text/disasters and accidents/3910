Yemen military plane crash kills 10
A Yemeni military plane has crashed in the capital, Sanaa, killing all 10 people on board, officials have said.
The Antonov came down in an empty market in the al-Hassaba district as it tried to make an emergency landing after one of its engines failed.
One resident said there were three explosions as the plane crashed. Several shops were destroyed. It is not clear if anyone on the ground was hurt.
Officials said there was no indication of any sabotage.
A source at Sanaa's main airport told the AFP news agency that the military aircraft had been on a training mission. It had been attempting to make an emergency landing at a military air base near the airport.
A civil defence source said the dead included five military officers.
The market in al-Hassaba has been abandoned since clashes between Yemen's biggest tribal confederation and security forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh during last year's anti-government uprising.
In October 2011, four people were killed when an Antonov crashed on landing at al-Anad air base in southern Yemen.
