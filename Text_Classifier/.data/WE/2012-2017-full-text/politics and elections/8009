Trial of former Egyptian president Mursi adjourned
The trial of deposed Egyptian president Mohammed Mursi has been adjourned until 8 January.
Mr Mursi and 14 other Islamists face trial on charges of inciting violence.
The charges relate to the deaths of about a dozen people in clashes outside the presidential palace in December after Mr Mursi enraged his opponents with a decree expanding his powers.
The defendants could face a life sentence or death penalty if found guilty.
Mr Mursi, an Islamist who was toppled by the army in July after mass protests against him, struck a defiant tone on the first day of his trial.
He chanted "down with military rule" and called himself the country's only "legitimate" president.
Mr Mursi appeared angry and interrupted the session repeatedly, prompting a judge to adjourn the case.
Opponents of Egypt's army-backed government say the trial is part of a campaign to crush Mr Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood movement and revive a police state.
It is the second time in just over two years that an overthrown president has been in court in Egypt, a nation said by government critics to have reverted to authoritarian rule.
The trial is not being aired on state television and journalists were barred from bringing their telephones into the courtroom set up in a Cairo police academy.
