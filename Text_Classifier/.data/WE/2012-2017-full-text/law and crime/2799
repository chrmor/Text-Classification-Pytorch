Mexico: Drug Suspect Extradited to U.S.
Sandra Ávila Beltrán, who is accused of being a drug trafficker and is known as the Queen of the Pacific, was extradited to the United States on Thursday to face cocaine-smuggling charges filed in a United States District Court in Florida. In 2007, Ms. Ávila’s arrest in Mexico City on charges stemming from the 2001 seizure of nine tons of cocaine from a boat in the Mexican port of Manzanillo caused a stir because she was the first woman to be charged as the leader of an international drug-smuggling operation. She was acquitted of the Mexican charges at the end of 2010 and had been fighting extradition.
