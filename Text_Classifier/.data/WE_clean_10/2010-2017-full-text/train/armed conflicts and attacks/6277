Iraq: Deadly bomb attack in Baladruz
A suicide bomber has blown himself up in the eastern Iraqi town of Baladruz, killing at least six people and injuring 15, officials say.
The bomber targeted a mosque in the town, 90km (55 miles) north-east of Baghdad in Diyala province, a security official told Reuters.
The attack took place soon after evening prayers at about 2015 local time (1715 GMT).
Violence has waned in recent years but attacks in Iraq continue almost daily.
The attack took place in the town's Imam al-Hussein mosque.
At least 30 other worshippers were injured in the blast, officials said.
All the casualties were believed to be men.
In March, at least nine soldiers were killed in a suicide bomb attack on an Iraqi army base in Kanaan in Diyala.
