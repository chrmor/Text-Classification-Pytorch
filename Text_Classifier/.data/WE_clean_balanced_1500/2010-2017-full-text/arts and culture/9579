Slumdog Millionaire child actress's home in Mumbai fire
Indian child actress Rubina Ali, who acted in Slumdog Millionaire, says she has lost precious souvenirs of the 2008 Oscar-winning film in a fire.
The blaze late on Friday ravaged her home and scores of others in the Garib Nagar slum, near Mumbai's Bandra Railway Station.
Nobody was killed in the fire but 21 people were injured and more than 2,000 were left homeless, police say.
Rubina's father said he and his family had had to run from their home.
They had been watching television when they heard shouts of a fire and ran out of their tin-roofed shanty, he told the Associated Press news agency by telephone.
"We just grabbed what we could and dashed out," Rafiq Ali said.
"The fire spread so fast we couldn't get back in."
Rubina said she had lost all her awards and her collection of newspaper clippings and photographs from the success of the 2008 film.
"It's all gone, even my best clothes, everything," she told AP.
She added that the family had yet to move into a new apartment paid for by a trust set up by the film's director, Danny Boyle.
Rubina was eight when she played the role of the young Latika in Boyle's film, and her journey from the slum to the Oscar stage made international headlines.
