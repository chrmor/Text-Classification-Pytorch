Officials Seek Quarry Worker in Southern China Bombings
Investigators said they were seeking a quarry worker, identified as Wei Yinyong, 33. They also published his phone number and other personal information. Officials did not offer a motive for the attacks, though they said they had ruled out terrorism.
A number of previous acts of violence using explosives to target government offices and public places have been linked to men who bore grudges against the authorities, neighbors or doctors for perceived injustices.
But there were also questions on Thursday as to whether Mr. Wei had already been captured. Local news outlets, citing a police officer, said that he had been arrested. The official account of the Sina Weibo microblog later contradicted that report, saying the suspect was still at large and ordering the public and the news media not to release any information about the episode.
The blast on Thursday damaged a residential building near a local highway administrative bureau, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties.
At a news briefing on Wednesday, the Liucheng government described the attacks as a “criminal case” and said the police had found more than 60 suspicious packages. Officials abruptly ended the news conference without explanation, according to the Guangxi bureau of the China News Service. Residents later received text messages from the Liucheng Work Safety Administration warning them not to open recently delivered packages.
