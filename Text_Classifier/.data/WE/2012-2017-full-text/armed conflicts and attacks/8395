Israel and Lebanon Try to Defuse Tensions After Cross-Border Shooting
JERUSALEM — Israel and Lebanon appeared to be trying to defuse tensions on Monday after a cross-border shooting that killed an Israeli soldier and subsequent fire from Israeli forces that may have hit a soldier on the Lebanese side.
Military liaison officers from the two countries met with representatives of Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, at a border crossing near where the shootings occurred late Sunday to clarify the circumstances and restore calm.
The commander of Unifil, Maj. Gen. Paolo Serra, said preliminary findings indicated that the shooting of the Israeli soldier was “an individual action” by a Lebanese Army soldier “in contravention of the existing operational rules and procedures,” Agence France-Presse reported.
The Lebanese Army command issued a statement describing that shooting as an isolated episode and said a military committee was investigating the matter.
Late Sunday, hours after the initial shooting, Israeli troops fired at two Lebanese soldiers in the same area who were described by the Israelis as moving suspiciously. An Israeli military spokeswoman said that at least one of the two Lebanese soldiers was hit by Israeli fire, but there were no reports of casualties from the Lebanese side.
