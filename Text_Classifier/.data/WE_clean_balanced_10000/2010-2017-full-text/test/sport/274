The United States and Portugal took a water break in the first half
During the 39th minute of the first half of tonight’s World Cup game between the United States and Portugal, the referee stopped the match to allow both teams to go and get water.
The water break is allowed by FIFA rules any time after 30 minutes in a game played in extreme heat, but water breaks are not mandatory. This week a Brazilian court ruled that the referee must give a water break if any game is played in a temperature above 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit) in the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature index, which factors in wind, cloud cover, time of day and more.
It’s unclear if the water break was mandated by the referee because of the temperature, or if he took advantage of a small Jermaine Jones injury to allow the players to get some water while Jones received treatment. FIFA has confirmed that this was the first official water break of the tournament.
Perhaps most confusing was that the ref only added two minutes of stoppage time even though the water break seemed to last longer than that.
