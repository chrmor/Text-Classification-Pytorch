The officials said a mortar landed Wednesday on a residential area south of Sheik Zweid, a town in northern Sinai, hitting a house and killing nine of its residents.
Separately, officials said a missile landed on a house in another village, killing two civilians.
In a third attack, outside the provincial capital el-Arish, officials said an explosive detonated as a military vehicle drove past, killing two police officers. The officials spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Northern Sinai has been a longtime hotbed of Islamic insurgency.
Egyptian officials said the military had no operations in the area.
