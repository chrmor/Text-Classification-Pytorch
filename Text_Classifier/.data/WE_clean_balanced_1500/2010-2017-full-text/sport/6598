Former NASCAR champ Kurt Busch suspended
"NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership ... that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated," O'Donnell said.
The racing season officially begins Sunday with the Daytona 500. Busch could still race if his suspension is overturned in the appeals process.
Busch was accused by Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway in October. The judge in the civil case found her story to be true, ESPN reported. Hardin's statement said Driscoll had lied during her testimony and she had tried to intimidate witnesses.
