Crete stabbing: Eighteen young British men arrested
Eighteen young British men have been arrested in connection with the fatal stabbing of another British man on the Greek island of Crete.
Reports say the victim was 20 years old and was outside a bar in the coastal resort town of Malia when he was stabbed.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Malia, Greece, on 23 July.
"We stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family."
Eyewitnesses told Greek police a violent altercation took place in the early hours of Tuesday morning involving at least 30 British men, according to Athens-based newspaper Kathimerini.
The Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are aware of the arrests of a number of British nationals.... We are in touch with the local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance."
In recent years Malia has outgrown holiday resorts such as Ayia Napa and Laganas and is particularly popular among young British tourists.
It was the setting for the 2011 film The Inbetweeners Movie, featuring four teenage boys on their first foreign holiday without their parents.
Earlier this year British ambassador John Kittmer visited the resort to launch the Holiday Hangover campaign to raise awareness of problems that could arise while on holiday and to promote responsible behaviour.
The Foreign Office says about two million British tourists visit Greece every year. About half the cases it becomes involved there in concern young tourists on holiday in the resorts of Malia, Laganas, Kavos, Kardamena or Faliraki.
