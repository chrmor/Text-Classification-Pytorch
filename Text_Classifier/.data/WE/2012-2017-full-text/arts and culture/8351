Paul Walker Funeral to Be Private
The family of Paul Walker is planning a private funeral for the Fast & Furious star after the Los Angeles County coroner’s office released his body to Forest Lawn Mortuaries on Tuesday, reports the Los Angeles Times.
Walker, 40, died Nov. 30 alongside friend Roger Rodas after the Porsche Carrera GT Rodas was driving in Santa Clarita, Calif., careened into a light pole and tree, then burst into flames.
An autopsy last week confirmed Walker died of “traumatic and thermal injuries.” Authorities say speed played a role in the crash.
Also last week, detectives arrested a teenager accused of stealing some wreckage from the Porsche. According to the Associated Press, a second man has surrendered in the case.
Authorities say Anthony Janow, 25, turned himself in at the San Fernando courthouse on Tuesday. He was booked and released on $60,000 bail.
Prosecutors say Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel as the wreckage was being towed.
They were charged Monday with felony grand theft of personal property and two misdemeanors. They face up to 4½ years in jail if convicted.
Witty also is free on bail.
