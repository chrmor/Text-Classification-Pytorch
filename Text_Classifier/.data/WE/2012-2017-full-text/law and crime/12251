Gunman in South Korea kills 3, himself; second fatal shooting in 3 days
Guns are legal but not widely used in South Korea. Gun owners store their weapons at the local police station and sign them out for use, which can only be done during hunting season. The alleged gunman in Friday's shooting reportedly checked his weapon out at the police station that morning, shortly before driving to his brother's house.
