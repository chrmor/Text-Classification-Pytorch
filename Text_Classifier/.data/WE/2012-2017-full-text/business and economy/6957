News Corp. divides into two companies; 21st Century Fox is born
News Corp. executives expect its book publishing revenue to stabilize because profit margins are higher for electronic books than for hard copies. For its news and information properties, company managers last month outlined a strategy centered around growing subscription revenue, which they believe will offset declines in advertising revenue. The company also plans to experiment with different online windows of availability for news content. Some of Murdoch's weaker newspapers might be forced to scale back. Some of the publications have relied on News Corp.'s deep pockets and free-flowing profits from the television division to prop them up amid sliding circulation and advertising revenue.
