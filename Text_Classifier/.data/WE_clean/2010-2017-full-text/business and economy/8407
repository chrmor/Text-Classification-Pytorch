Today's News Out of China: The Dalian 'PX' Protests
I'll just note this event, with pointers toward more extensive coverage:
In my current article about this year's political crackdowns in China, I mention the argument that China's government, despite its phenomenal success in engineering high growth rates, is under much more pressure and challenge than outsiders generally realize. I cover a variety of reasons -- not including the recent high-speed rail crash and its aftermath, which happened after we went to press and has caused tremendous bitterness about official corruption. But the article does mention China's environmental catastrophes and the reactions they are provoking across the country.
Today tens of thousands of people are on the streets of Dalian, in northeast China, to protest pollution from a big factory making paraxylene (PX), a toxic chemical used in plastics and synthetic fibers. This is how things looked on Sunday morning in downtown Dalian.
These are offered not to magnify China's problems but as reminders of the extremely complicated mixture of successes and failures with which China's people and its government are contending. For instance, Dalian is probably most familiar to US newspaper readers as the site of regular World Economic Forum ("Davos") regional meetings. Therefore it is often the dateline for visitors' goggle-eyed reports on the pace and perfection of China's modernization. Today Dalian is an illustration of China's challenges as well as its achievements.
