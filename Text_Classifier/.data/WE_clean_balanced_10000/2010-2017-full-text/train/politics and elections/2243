Labour candidate wins Leicester South by-election
The election was called when previous Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby stepped down to enter the race to become the city's elected mayor.
Mr Ashworth beat Liberal Democrat candidate Zuffar Haq, who came in second place, and the Conservatives' Jane Hunt, who was third.
He won 19,771 votes, compared to 7,693 for Mr Haq and 5,169 for Ms Hunt and promised to work for the city.
In his acceptance speech, Mr Ashworth said: "Labour is listening more, working harder and changing to get in touch."
