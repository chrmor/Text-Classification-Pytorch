U2 can benefit if you're a politician
Prime Minister Julia Gillard is one of three senior politicians to receive a U2 signature iPod from rock star and activist Bono.
The iPods, also given to Liberal deputy leader Julie Bishop and Treasurer Wayne Swan, are among the latest additions to the MPs' interests register tabled in federal parliament on Thursday.
The prime minister's 13-page addition to the register included tickets for partner Tim Mathieson to attend the Gold Coast 600 motor race, a $300 Salvatore Ferragamo scarf, a rug from Afghanistan, a $1000 porcelain bowl from Vietnam's prime minister, and tickets to The Ashes cricket test in Sydney.
She has surrendered most of the items to her department and made payments to keep the iPod and scarf.
Qantas has provided a number of senior MPs with iPads, including Ms Bishop, Mr Albanese, Labor MP Alan Griffin, and ministers Peter Garrett and Warren Snowdon.
