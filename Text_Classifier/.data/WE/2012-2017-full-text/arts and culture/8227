Thanksgivukkah is in the 'spirit of celebration'
For the first time since 1888, the Jewish festival of Hanukkah coincides this year with Thanksgiving.
The hybrid holiday has been dubbed Thanksgivukkah as a result, with families across the US finding unique ways to celebrate.
Rabbi Joshua Stanton told the BBC's Nick Bryant, reporting for the Today programme, he believes it is all done "in good fun, in the spirit of celebration".
"I've heard about menurkeys, which are menorahs shaped like turkeys, going for $100," he added.
First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday 28 November 2013.
