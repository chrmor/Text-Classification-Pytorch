Myanmar elections: strong start for Aung San Suu Kyi's party as first seats declared - as it happened
Streets stalls sold red flags with golden peacocks – the NLD banner – and smaller stickers that people stuck to their faces. Children wearing red headbands were hoisted by their parents onto parked cars to get a better view over the crowds. People snacked on pineapple and melon chunks bought from stalls on wheels.
Kyaw Zaw Shwe, 48, said he left Myanmar for Singapore five years agoto find a better salary as a chemical engineer but had come back to vote.
“There has been no change in the past five years,” he said, when asked about sweeping political reforms implemented by the quasi-civilian government that took over from the military junta.
“I voted in the 1990 election,” he said, referring to polls that were won by the NLD but later annulled by the generals. “In 1990, we kept quiet. We celebrated but amongst ourselves,” he said, looking at the crowds, a rare sight in a country that suffered decades ofoppressive rule.
“Suu Kyi can lead. I believe in her, the past five years she’s been working on renovating the Rangoon hospital,” he said, using Yangon’s former name.
The man was interrupted as another man, wearing an NLD flag as a cape, walked over to him.
“Hello!” screamed the man, who identified himself as Myo Min Win.
“We were friends in Singapore because I worked their too,” Myo Min Win said. “We haven’t seen each other for years.”
They started discussing the election with vigour, both glowing red from the reflection of the giant LED screens. “I’m only 34, so I wasn’t old enough in 1990 to vote. This is the first time for me,” he told his friend.
