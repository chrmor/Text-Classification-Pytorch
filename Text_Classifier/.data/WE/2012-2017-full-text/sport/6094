NFL Draft 2013 - as it happened
Yeah, us too. Sadly we won’t be seeing any of that (in the NFL at least) for another five months. What we have today is the next best thing. In fact, some people might argue that this is even better. What we have today is hope in the form of the NFL Draft. This is the day on which every team’s fans can dare to dream that they have just unearthed the sport’s Next Big Thing, writes Paolo Bandini.
It is also a day of strong opinions – one on which any know-it-all with a keyboard can test themselves against the coaches, scouts and general managers making calls in their respective teams’ war rooms. Even as I type, countless fans around the world are fine-tuning their own personal mock drafts and draft boards. Mercifully for me, publication deadlines mean that mine is already written, and I have to live with it – for better or for worse.
The draft formally begins at 8pm ET, 1am GMT – though you can be certain that behind closed doors the action has already begun. All week we have been hearing rumours of different teams looking to trade up or down from their present positions. You can be certain that plenty of phone calls, texts and emails have already been exchanged between teams exploring their options.
We shall do our best to keep you up to speed with all such developments, as well as the picks themselves, as this evening unfolds. In the meantime, the uninitiated might want to check out this piece by Brad Gagnon, explaining how the draft came to be the media event that it is today. 
Paolo and Steve Busfield will be sharing liveblogging duties tonight.
