Judge orders medical evaluation of ailing blues singer Etta James
A Riverside County Superior Court judge on Thursday ordered an immediate medical evaluation of R&B great Etta James after her son’s attorney said the health of the singer, who is receiving care at her Riverside home, could be in “serious danger.”
James’ husband and sons have been locked in a court dispute over control of the singer's $1 million in savings, with all parties involved saying their only concern is to ensure that James receives proper medical care.
A confidential report by a court investigator raised concerns about the quality of James’ care, however, including a procedure to insert a feeding tube into her stomach being conducted at her home, her son’s attorneys told the judge during the hearing.
The attorneys for James’ son, Donto James of Moreno Valley, also questioned the quality of care being provided by a doctor who lives at the singer’s home and provides around-the-clock care.
"I think we should get a restraining order and get her out of there," Joseph E. Deering Jr. said of the doctor. "This woman is there 24 hours a day...."
James has dementia and is undergoing treatment for leukemia, requiring continuous care for a fiery 72-year-old performer, best known for her bluesy riffs and ballads, including "At Last" and "Tell Mama."
