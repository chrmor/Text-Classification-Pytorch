Romario elected to Brazil's legislature
The former Fifa World Player of the Year ran on a Socialist Party ticket in southeastern Rio de Janeiro state in Brazil's national elections on Sunday. His party is allied with outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's Worker's Party.
Although he has no political experience, Romario, 44, promised to "score a new goal for Brazil" and vowed to support sports programs and policies favouring the handicapped. His youngest daughter, Ivy, has Down syndrome.
Romario was a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning team, and played for FC Barcelona and Valencia in Spain, PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands, and Vasco da Gamma, Flamengo and Fluminense in Brazil.
The famed striker scored more than 1,000 goals during his career before he retired in 2007.
Fans and photographers swarmed Romario when he drove up in an armoured BMW to cast his ballot. After voting, he visited the Rio de Janeiro shanty town where he grew up.
