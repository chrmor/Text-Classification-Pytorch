Hong Kong tightens mortgage rules amid bubble concerns
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Friday it will tighten some types of mortgage lending to guard against credit risks, moves that reflect its growing unease over risks to the banking system as the city's property market continues to mark new heights.
The announcement came as government officials said reducing the risk of a bubble in the property sector was now a top priority.
Norman Chan, the chief executive of the agency that oversees the city's banks, said tighter standards were necessary to help safeguard the banking system.
"As property prices continue to rise, the risk to residential mortgage loans are increasing," he said in a statement.
Under rules effective from Friday, banks will see tighter limits on loans made for the purchase of high-end properties.
Banks had been limited to a 60% loan-to-valuation threshold on properties worth $20 million Hong Kong dollars ($2.57 million) or more, but Friday's rules will tighten the cap to properties starting at HK$12 million.
Buyers seeking properties for investment purposes will also be limited to 60% for loan-to-valuation financing.
Home buyers will still be able to access higher ratios of mortgage financing on properties valued below the freshly-lowered ceiling.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government on Friday raised its full-year economic growth forecast after reporting gross domestic product grew faster than expected in the second quarter.
Hong Kong's GDP rose 6.5% in the April-to-June quarter from the year-earlier period, easing from an 8% rise in the previous quarter, but outpacing analysts' expectations for a 5.7% increase.
The government raised its full-year GDP growth forecast to 5% to 6%, from 4% to 5%.
It kept its CPI forecast unchanged at 2.3%.
