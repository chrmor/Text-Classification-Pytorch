Yemen says supports post-Mubarak rule in Egypt
DUBAI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Yemen said on Saturday it respected the choice of the Egyptian people, whose mass protests forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak on Friday, and would support them in their search for progress and development.
Against a background of spreading anti-government protests in Yemen itself, the official news agency Saba said the government was confident Egypt’s Higher Military Council would be able to manage the country’s affairs in the transition period.
Saba, quoting an official source, said Yemen was keen to strengthen relations and would support the Egyptian people “in everything that would bring them stability, progress and development.”

Saleh, who has ruled Yemen for 32 years and is a key U.S. ally against al Qaeda, made his boldest move yet to stave off turmoil last week when he promised to step down at the end of his term in 2013.
