Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has banned Israeli parliamentarians and ministers from visiting the Temple Mount in an effort to quell a rising wave of Palestinian violence, that has left four Israelis dead and dozens injured. Israel believes the terror attacks over the last week in the West Bank, Jerusalem, Kiryat Gat and Petah Tikva were were sparked by recent clashes between security forces and Palestinian rioters on the Temple Mount that began during the Rosh Hashanah Holiday in September.
Netanyahu adopted the measure on Wednesday night after consulting with defense and security experts.

Ya’alon has become convinced that the step is necessary to protect national security and public order.The activities of these male and female groups “form a central component in the creation of tension and violence on the Temple Mount in particular, and Jerusalem in general,” the defense minister’s office says.
