In a terrifying scene at an Indian soccer game, a stand filled with fans collapsed injuring more than 100 people, six seriously, according to The Telegraph.
The stand collapsed before a game between Saban Kottakkal and Mohammadans Mouval. Heavy rain is thought to be the cause, making the wooden stands moist and unable to hold the weight of the spectators.
