Yemen conflict: Suicide bombing near Aden palace kills seven
At least seven people have been killed in a suicide car bomb attack near the presidential palace in Yemen's southern port city of Aden, officials say.
The bomber is reported to have struck a checkpoint between 500m and 1km (0.3-0.6 miles) from the residence. The dead included soldiers and civilians.
Officials told the Reuters news agency President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was inside the palace, but was unharmed.
The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has said it was behind the attack.
Last month, IS claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed Aden's governor, Jaafar Mohammed Saad. It also bombed a hotel in the city that was used by Prime Minister Khaled Bahah in October.
IS and the rival jihadist group al-Qaeda have taken advantage of the chaos in Yemen caused by the conflict between the Houthi rebel movement, which controls the capital Sanaa, and pro-government troops and militiamen, who are backed by a Saudi-led multinational coalition.
Mr Hadi and his cabinet have been based in Aden since July, when loyalist forces drove the rebels out of Sanaa following months of fierce fighting.
The president was forced to flee abroad in March after the Houthis and allied security personnel advanced on the city, prompting coalition air strikes.
More than 5,800 people have been killed since then, according to the UN, while 80% of the population is now in need of some form of humanitarian aid.
