Dusty Rhodes, WWE Hall of Famer, Dies at Age 69
The wrestling world lost a true legend Thursday, as WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes died at the age of 69.
WWE.com first reported the tragic news, although details surrounding his passing were not immediately available. Â 
WWE Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative Paul "Triple H" Levesque tweeted some kind words about The American Dream after the news broke:
Rhodes will forever be remembered as one of the most popular and charismatic stars in wrestling history. The Austin, Texas, native was a three-time NWA World Heavyweight champion and engaged in memorable feuds with Ric Flair, Terry Funk, Harley Race and many others.
In recent years, Rhodes lent his talent to WWE's developmental system, NXT, where he worked as a booker, producer and mentor to the up-and-coming talent.
Current WWE Superstar Titus O'Neil fondly remembers the interactions he had with Dusty:
The same can be said for Tag Team champion Xavier Woods:
Rhodes left an everlasting mark on the wrestling business, and his legend will continue to grow, as his sons, Dustin "Goldust" and Cody "Stardust" Rhodes, are still part of the WWE roster.
While Rhodes never had a great physique and wasn't a technical marvel in the ring, he connected with the people like few others due to his Common Man and Son of a Plumber monikers.
The American Dream was a true one-of-a-kind talent in the wrestling business, and his contributions will be remembered for many years to come.
