Cargo ship with 22 crewmen hits rocks on Greek island
ATHENS, Greece (AP) â€” Greek authorities say rescuers are trying to reach a Cyprus-flagged cargo ship with 22 crewmen that ran aground in a strong gale on an Aegean Sea island and is taking in water.
The Merchant Marine Ministry says coast guard vessels are heading for the northern coast of Andros where the Good Faith ran aground early Wednesday.
The freighter, which was empty of cargo, was heading from the Greek port of Eleusis to Odessa in the Black Sea. The ministry said the crew consisted of 21 Filipinos and one Romanian.
The rescue effort was hampered by adverse weather, as Greece was hit by a cold spell with snow falling in central Athens.
