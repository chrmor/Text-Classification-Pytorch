President Ian Khama's Botswana Democratic Party secures election win
GABARONE, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Botswanaâ€™s ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) secured 33 out of 57 parliament seats that were being contested at national elections, initial results showed, putting President Ian Khama at the helm for a second five-year term.
Botswana voted on Friday in the southern African nation and re-elected the liberation BDP party that has ruled the diamond-producing nation since independence from Britain 48 years ago.
The BDP is expected to win a reduced majority, after getting 79 percent of the seats in the previous election in 2009.
