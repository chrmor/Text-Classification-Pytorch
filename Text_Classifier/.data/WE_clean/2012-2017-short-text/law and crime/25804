The United States Supreme Court confirms (5â€“4) a temporary stay of a lower court ruling which would have required Texas to undergo new redistricting of congressional districts with large Hispanic and African American populations. The ruling was made in advance of a formal hearing on the gerrymandering case, Abbott v. Perez, which has no scheduled hearing date yet. (Politico), (The Houston Chronicle)
