Mahathir Mohamad quits Malaysia ruling UMNO party, protesting corruption
Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia's former premier Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday he is quitting the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, as it is being seen as "supporting corruption" under Prime Minister Najib Razak's leadership.
Dr Mahathir, Malaysia's longest-serving leader, remains a highly respected and influential figure and has become the fiercest critic of Mr Najib, who is facing pressure over a graft scandalsurrounding state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
"I won't call it UMNO anymore, this is Najib's party," Dr Mahathir told reports at a press conference. "I feel embarrassed that I am associated with a party that is seen as supporting corruption - it had caused me to feel ashamed."
Mr Najib's office had no immediate comment on Dr Mahathir's statement.
