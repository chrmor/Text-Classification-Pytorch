Cyclone havoc on Indian coast
Gopalpur, India: A massive relief operation has kicked into gear in eastern India in the wake of a terrifying cyclone that killed at least 18 people, forced a million from homes and left a trail of destruction.
Cyclone Phailin was dissipating rapidly after pounding the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, uprooting trees, overturning trucks, flattening homes and knocking out power lines.
Casualties were minimised after the biggest evacuation in the countryâ€™s history saw a million people huddle in shelters and government buildings as the ferocious storm took hold.
Seventeen people were killed in Odisha and one further south in Andhra Pradesh, government and disaster management officials said.
