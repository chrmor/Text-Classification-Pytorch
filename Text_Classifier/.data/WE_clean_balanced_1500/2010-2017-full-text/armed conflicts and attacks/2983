Truck bomb kills at least 60 in Baghdad's Sadr City - sources
BAGHDAD, Aug 13 (Reuters) - At least 60 people were killed and 200 wounded on Thursday when a refrigerated truck packed with explosives blew up in a crowded market in Sadr City, a Shi'ite district in northeastern Baghdad, police and medical sources said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, but Islamic State, ultra-radical Sunni Muslim militants who seized swathes of northern Iraq last year, have claimed similar attacks targeting Shi'ite neighbourhoods.
