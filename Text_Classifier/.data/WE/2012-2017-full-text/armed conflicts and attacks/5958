PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- The Pakistani Taliban, an insurgent group focused mostly on the Pakistani state but which claimed responsibility for a failed bomb attack in New York nearly three years ago, has denied any involvement in the bomb blasts at the Boston Marathon on Monday.
The group is responsible for many of the suicide bombings and terror attacks that have wreaked havoc on this South Asian nation for years. It does, however, regard the U.S. as an enemy and helped train Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani American who confessed to engineering a botched bombing attempt in New York’s Times Square in 2010.
Nevertheless, the group’s spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, issued a statement Tuesday disowning any connection to the bombings in Boston.
"Certainly, America is our target and we will attack the U.S. and its allies whenever the [Pakistani Taliban] finds the opportunity, but we are not involved in this attack," Ehsan said.
The Pakistani Taliban is made up of factions intent on toppling the current government and imposing Sharia, or Islamic, law. The group maintains ties with Al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban and other Pakistani militant groups entrenched in the country’s tribal belt.
