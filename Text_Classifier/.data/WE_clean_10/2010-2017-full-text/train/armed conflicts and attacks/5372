Army asks Egyptians to return to normal life-TV
CAIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Egypt’s army said on Wednesday that Egyptians had delivered their message, their demands had been heard and it was time for them to help Egypt return to normal life, a military spokesman said on state television.
It was a clear call for protesters to leave the streets.
“The army forces are calling on you ... You began by going out to express your demands and you are the ones capable of restoring normal life,” a spokesman said, adding that the message and demands had been heard.
The army has previously issued statements saying it would not use violence against protesters and saying it understood the “legitimate demands” of the people. (Writing by Edmund Blair)
