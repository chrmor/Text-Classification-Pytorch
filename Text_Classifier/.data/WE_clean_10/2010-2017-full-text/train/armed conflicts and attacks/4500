S.Sudan says there will be no war over Abyei
JUBA, Sudan, May 26 (Reuters) - South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir on Thursday called on north Sudan to withdraw its forces from the disputed Abyei region but said there would be no war over the conflict.
“We will not go back to war, it will not happen,” Kiir told reporters in Juba, the capital of south Sudan which plans to become independent on July 9.
North Sudanese armed forces seized control of the oil-producing Abyei region on Saturday, forcing tens of thousands to flee and sparking an international outcry.
