Rangers replaced with 'Club 12' in SPL fixture list
Rangers did not appear on the Scottish Premier League fixture list and were instead replaced with 'Club 12'.
Charles Green's consortium bought Rangers last week and it has formed a new company that will have to re-apply for membership in the SPL.
But no date has yet been set for the vote, where Rangers need to win support of seven of the other 11 clubs.
'Club 12' begin the season at Kilmarnock while champions Celtic start against Aberdeen on Saturday 4 August.
If Rangers are not admitted to the SPL, the 12th place is likely to fall to either Scottish First Division runners-up Dundee or Dunfermline, who finished bottom of the SPL last term.
