Coalition government in talks to resettle refugees in the Philippines
â€‹Refugees who travelled to Australia by boat could be permanently resettled in the Philippines under a deal being negotiated, but senior government sources fear the premature leaking of the deal to the media could see the proposal scuttled.
The deal, reported to be worth about $150 million, would be similar to the one Australia struck with Cambodia to send refugees processed on Nauru to the impoverished nation. However that deal collapsed with just four refugees opting to resettle there at a cost of $50 million to the Australian taxpayer.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has accused refugee advocates of undermining the Cambodia deal and this week confirmed the Australian government was looking to forge similar resettlement deals with other countries.
Mr Dutton on Friday confirmed Australia had had talks with a "number of bilateral partners" including the Philippines to reach a regional solution on the issue.
