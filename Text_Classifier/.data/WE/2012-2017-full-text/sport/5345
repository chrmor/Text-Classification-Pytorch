Jose Bautista: Canada broke baseball’s code
DUNEDIN, FLA.—Jose Bautista says Canada broke baseball’s unwritten code Saturday by trying to run up the score in their World Baseball Classic victory over Mexico, regardless of the tournament’s tiebreaker rules.
“I’m not buying the fact that teams are bunting when they’re up by six because of the rules of the WBC,” Bautista told reporters Sunday morning before the Blue Jays’ 3-0 loss to the New York Yankees at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium.
“I believe in the unwritten rules of the game. They should be respected. It’s a code amongst players and everybody who plays baseball at a level higher than Little League knows what it is and there’s no excuse.”
In the ninth inning of Canada’s 10-3 victory over Mexico — they were up 9-3 at the time — Canadian catcher Chris Robinson, of London, Ont., bunted himself aboard leading off the final frame.
Mexican pitcher Arnold Leon then hit the next batter, Toronto’s Rene Tosoni. Benches cleared and a violent brawl ensued.
