Video: Cameron sorry at 'shocking collusion' in Finucane murder
BRITISH State employees actively facilitated and furthered the loyalist murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane but there was no over-arching conspiracy, a new report commissioned by David Cameron has found.
BRITISH State employees actively facilitated and furthered the loyalist murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane but there was no over-arching conspiracy, a new report commissioned by David Cameron has found.
Desmond de Silva's review of the 1989 murder of the Catholic father of three found that collusion by the state went beyond a failure to prevent the crime.
Sir Desmond examined the role of two British agents in the murder and found that another man involved was later also recruited as an agent even though he was suspected in the UDA murder of Mr Finucane.
While the QC accused successive UK Governments of a "wilful and abject failure" to implement an appropriate legal framework for running agents within paramilitary groups, he said no minister was aware of the plot to kill the solicitor.
Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons the murder was "an appalling crime" and said the degree of collusion exposed was "unacceptable".
And he said, in a message to the family: "I am deeply sorry."
Outlining the findings of the report, Mr Cameron continued: "Sir Desmond says on the balance of probabilities, an RUC officer or officers did propose Patrick Finucane as a UDA target when speaking to a loyalist paramilitary."
Mr Cameron said there was a further failure to investigate and arrest members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period.
And he said it was all part of a "wider, relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice" following the murder. Mr Cameron said the De Silva review found senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators and that RUC Special Branch were "responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation".
And he added: "While Sir Desmond finds no political conspiracy he is clear ministers were misled.
"He finds that, and I quote, Army and MoD officials provided the Secretary of State for Defence with highly misleading and in parts factually inaccurate advice about the Force Research Unit's handling of Nelson (a British agent who played a role in selecting targets)."
Mr Cameron said he acknowledged the Finucane family had continued to call for a public inquiry in order to establish the facts surrounding the murder.
He said: "I know they opposed this review process and I respect their views. However, I do respectfully disagree a public inquiry would produce a fuller picture of what happened and what went wrong.
"The history of public inquiries in Northern Ireland would suggest had we gone down this route, we would not know now what we know today."
The Army and Special Branch had advance notice of a series of planned UDA assassinations, but nothing was done, he said.
Mr Cameron said De Silva found that employees of the state and state agents played "key roles" in the Finucane murder, adding: "It cannot be argued that these were rogue agents."
The review found that the British Army must take a degree of responsibility for targeting activities carried out by the UDA's Brian Nelson, said Mr Cameron.
There was a "relentless" effort to defeat the ends of justice after the killing and Army officials provided the MoD with highly misleading and inaccurate information, Mr Cameron said.
But the review found no evidence that any Government was informed in advance of Mr Finucane's murder or knew about the subsequent cover-up, he said.
Mr Cameron said the Finucane family suffered "the most grievous wrongs" and he respected their view that the de Silva review was not the right response.
But he said he disagreed with them, and said a public inquiry might not have uncovered so much information about the killing.
In his report Sir Desmond said he was in no doubt that state employees were involved in collusion with terrorist killers.
He said: "The real importance in my view is that a series of positive actions by employees of the State actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice.
"My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the State were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder.
"However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the State, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching State conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane."
