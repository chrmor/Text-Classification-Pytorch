Parent : Mexico attorney general reports 6 bags of remains in missing student investigation
Relatives of missing college students say Mexican authorities tell of finding six bags of unidentified human remains in the southern state of Guerrero near where their 43 sons disappeared Sept. 26.
Manuel Martinez says Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told families Friday that authorities could not say yet whether the remains were of the students, but the find opened a new avenue of investigation.
The remains were located along a river in Cocula after confessions by two suspects.
Authorities say the Iguala city mayor sent police to intercept the students, who came to town to kcocollect money and had commandeered buses. Six people died in a police attack and prosecutors say 43 students were handed over to a drug gang. At least 59 people have been detained in the case.
