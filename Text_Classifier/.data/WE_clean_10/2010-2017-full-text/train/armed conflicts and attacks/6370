Robert Fisk, a longtime foreign correspondent for The Independent, a British newspaper, has told Al Jazeera that he does not believe Western sanctions imposed on top Syrian officials will have a real impact against the government's crackdown on protesters.
Fisk said that sanctions against other countries in the past had failed to work.
