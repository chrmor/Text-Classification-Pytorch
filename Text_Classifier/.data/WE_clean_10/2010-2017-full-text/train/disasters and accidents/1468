Puerto Rico Loses Power and Sets a Curfew
The authorities warned weary residents not to let down their guard, because flash flooding and mudslides could prove more deadly than the initial winds from the storm.
The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosselló, announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew effective Wednesday until Saturday. Thousands of people there were scrambling to hundreds of shelters, some of which Mr. Rosselló acknowledged might not be storm-worthy. The roads, he said in a radio interview later on Wednesday, were “practically undrivable.”
“The damage is very extensive,” he said Wednesday night in an interview on CNN. “It is nothing short of a major disaster.”
• The storm made landfall at Yabucoa in Puerto Rico’s southeast shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday, as a Category 4 storm with winds as strong as 155 miles per hour. It had crossed the United States Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm, then weakened. Its winds were blowing about 110 miles per hour on Wednesday evening.
• Forecasters say Puerto Rico will see about two feet of rain by Friday. Storm surges are expected to raise water levels by as much as six feet in the Dominican Republic.
• Governor Rosselló told CNN late Wednesday that officials knew of only one fatality in Puerto Rico, but noted that they still could not communicate with the southeastern part of the island, which was hit earliest and hardest by the storm. “We still don’t have a lot of information,” he said.
• President Trump late Wednesday designated the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area to make federal funds available to people on St. Croix who were affected by the storm.
• Hartley Henry, an adviser to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that there had been seven confirmed deaths from Hurricane Maria on that island. Two people were also killed on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, officials said.
• Officials at Ross University Medical School on Dominica said they planned to evacuate students and others by boat to St. Lucia.
