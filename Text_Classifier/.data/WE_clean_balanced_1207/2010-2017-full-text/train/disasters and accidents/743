U.S. Navy aviators rescued after jets collide off NC coast
OUTER BANKS, N.C., May 26 (UPI) -- Four U.S. Navy servicemen were hospitalized Thursday after two F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets collided off the coast of North Carolina, military officials said.
The fighters were participating in a training mission Thursday morning when the planes were "involved in a mishap" around 10:40 a.m. EDT Thursday, a Navy spokesman said. The jets were off the Carolina coast near Cape Hatteras when the collision occurred, officials said.
Petty Officer Fagal Nifin told The Virginian-Pilot four people were rescued by the Coast Guard and a local fishing vessel and taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital for treatment.
Military officials said none of the four -- two pilots and two flight officers -- received serious injury.
ABC News reported that all four had ejected from the fighters safely.
The crash occurred in an area frequently used for fighter jet training for those based at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach.
The Navy said it is investigating the cause.
