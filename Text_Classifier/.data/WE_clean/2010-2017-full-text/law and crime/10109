Palestinian detainee Hana Shalabi ends hunger strike
A Palestinian woman being held in detention in Israel, Hana Shalabi, is ending her 43-day hunger strike.
The move is part of a deal which will see her exiled to the Gaza Strip.
Ms Shalabi is reportedly a supporter of the militant group Islamic Jihad and was arrested by troops in the West Bank last month.
She went on hunger strike to protest against being held without charge. Israel uses the measure against those it deems a security risk.
Last week human rights group Amnesty International urged Israel to either prosecute Ms Shalabi or free her as she was "at risk of death".
The organisation Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also warned she had lost 14kg (31lbs), was experiencing muscle wasting, aggravated weight loss and excruciating pain.
Under the deal Ms Shalabi must remain in Gaza for three years, although her lawyer said he did not know when she will be moved due to the state of her health.
The Palestinian Prisoner Affairs Minister, Issa Qaraqaa, told the AFP news agency. "She had to accept because Israel put pressure on her. But we are totally opposed to all deportation measures."
Ms Shalabi was one of the Palestinian prisoners released from Israel's jails last year as part of a deal to free the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
Human Rights groups have condemned Israel for holding around 300 Palestinian prisoners in jail under administrative detention orders, which allow people who are considered a security threat to be held indefinitely.
Last month another Palestinian prisoner, Khader Adnan, ended his 66-day hunger strike when Israel promised to release him in April.
