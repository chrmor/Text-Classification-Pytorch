CASA acted on 'serious, immediate risk'
The aviation regulator says it grounded Tiger Airways' Australian fleet because it lost confidence in the airline's ability to manage its safety.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has suspended Tiger Airways Australia's operations for a week, saying it believes permitting the airline to continue to fly poses a serious and imminent risk to air safety.
CASA spokesman Peter Gibson said it was a serious step and not one the regulator took lightly.
"In this case, the risk got to a stage where we believed there was a serious and immediate risk to safety, that's why they're on the ground," he told reporters in Canberra.
It's the first time CASA has grounded an entire airline and Mr Gibson said the regulator rarely put airlines on the ground, even smaller operators.
It grounded Ansett's 767 fleet of 10 aircraft in April 2001 and seven of the jets in December 2000.
