Lebanon army says IAF jets violated country's airspace -  Haaretz - Israel News
Israeli warplanes violated Lebanon's airspace Monday on several occasions, the Lebanese Army Command said in a statement.
Two fighter jets flew at low altitude over areas in northern and southern Lebanon as well as over areas in the capital, the army statement said.
The violations continued throughout the day, it added.
The army stressed that the breach constituted a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Lebanese-based militant group Hezbollah and Israel.
According to statistics from the Lebanese government, Israel has breached the provisions of resolution 1701 on more than 7,000 occasions by crossing Lebanon's airspace, territorial waters, and border.
Earlier this month Lebanese military experts said they discovered and dismantled two spy cameras planted in the country's mountains by Israel.
One of the long range spying systems was placed on Sannine Mountain, which overlooks Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley, and the second was on Barouk Mountain, southeast of the capital, the army said in a statement.
Shortly after the report of the discovery, Lebanese television published photos of the spy installations that the Lebanese Army had found showing one of the devices bearing Hebrew writing.
According to reports, the installations included photographic equipment as well as laser and broadcast equipment. Â
