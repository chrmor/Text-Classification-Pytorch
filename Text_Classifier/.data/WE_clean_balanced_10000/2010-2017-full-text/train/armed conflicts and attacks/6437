Dozens killed, wounded in Damascus blasts - Syria TV
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Dozens of people were killed or wounded in two “terrorist explosions” which struck a southern district of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, state television said.
Television footage showed dozens of mangled, burnt and smouldering vehicles, some containing incinerated human remains. A large crater could be seen in the road and at least one lorry had been overturned.
Damascus residents said the two explosions, which happened almost simultaneously shortly before 8 a.m. (0500 GMT), struck a district of Damascus which houses a military intelligence complex involved in President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown on 14 months of protests.
