Final: Phllies 2, Reds 0
Cole Hamels pitched a shutout, and Chase Utley hit a solo home run as the Phillies beat the Reds, 2-0, to sweep their National League division series.
Hamels allowed only five hits and struck out nine batters. Johnny Cueto pitched well for the Reds in a losing effort, allowing two runs (one earned) in five innings.
The Phillies took the lead in the first inning on a throwing error by Orlando Cabrera, which allowed Placido Polanco to score on a routine ground ball by Jason Werth. Utley hit his homer to right-center in the fifth, increasing the lead to 2-0.
The Reds mounted a brief ninth-inning rally when Brandon Phillips lined a single to left field. But Joey Votto grounded into a double play, and Scott Rolen struck out to end the game.
The win was Hamels’s sixth career postseason victory. The Phillies will move on to the National League Championship Series for the third consecutive year.
