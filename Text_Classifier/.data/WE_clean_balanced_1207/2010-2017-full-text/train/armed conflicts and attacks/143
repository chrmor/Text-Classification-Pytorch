Turkish Airstrikes Kill 67 Kurdish Militants in Iraq
Turkey's air force has carried out air strikes against Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq, killing at least 67 militants, the military said Saturday.
The March 9 raids were carried out by 14 F-16 and F-4 fighter jets, and targeted camps, ammunition depots and other installations run by the Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK.
The military says the offensive targeted sites in five areas: Qandil, Metina, Avasin, Haftanin and Basyan.
The Turkish Air Force has been conducting strikes on PKK sites in northern Iraq since July when peace efforts between the government and the rebels collapsed.
The PKK is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. The group says it is fighting for greater autonomy and rights for the country's largest ethnic minority.
