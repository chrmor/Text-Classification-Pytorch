Many persons are feared dead as the military sustained its aerial bombardment of creeks located in Lagos and Ogun States where militants are believed to be hiding between Thursday morning and the time of filing this report on Friday. Informed sources told The Eagle Online on that the bombardment commenced in the wee hours of Thursday. It was learnt it would last till Sunday. The operation involves operatives of the Nigeria Police, Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Navy. Several residents of the areas close to the creeks, including some journalists living at the Journalists Estate in Arepo, Ogun State, have fled their homes. They have moved their families out to safety. The bombardment was said to be a last option as the Nigerian Navy said it does not have operational boats that could access the areas of the creek where the militants use as their hideouts to launch attacks on Lagos and Ogun States. The areas are said to be too thick to access for the boats in the fleet of the Nigerian Navy. The Eagle Online was, however, informed that before the operation commenced, the leaders of the affected community had been properly briefed by the military heirarchy. The Eagle Online was told that the community leaders were told to advice their people to keep away from certain areas between Thursday and Sunday. It was gathered that many militants have been killed since the operation began in the wee hours of Thursday.
