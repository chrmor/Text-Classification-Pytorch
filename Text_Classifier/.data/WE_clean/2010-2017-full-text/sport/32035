AFL grand final: Richmond earns a famous victory, beating Adelaide by 48 points to end a 37-year drought
The Richmond fairytale is finally complete, as the Tigers beat the Adelaide Crows by 48 points at the MCG to break a 37-year premiership drought.
Jack Graham was the surprise X-factor, kicking three goals in only his fifth game of AFL football, as the Tigers powered away from the Crows in the second half to win 16.12 (108) to 8.12 (60).
The Tigers' last grand final appearance had been in a 1982 loss to Carlton, and their last flag win was in 1980 when they crushed Collingwood.
But the party started early at the MCG as the roars of 40-50,000 Tigers fans at the ground lifted several levels, with their team leading by 34 points at three quarter-time on the way to a famous victory.
For Dustin Martin, the week ended on a perfect note, with the Brownlow medallist becoming the first player to add a Norm Smith medal for best-on-ground to the league's best-and-fairest.
He had 29 disposals and two goals, marshalling the Yellow and Black to a brilliant flag-winning performance.
There had been a huge roar for the Tigers as the game got under way, but it was the Crows who settled better.
The Tigers brought pressure, trying to stop the Crows moving through the corridor.
But Matt Crouch found Rory Sloane with a chip and Sloane kicked straight for the Crows opener. A minute or so later, Nick Vlaustuin slipped over under pressure and Eddie Betts took care of the rest.
The Richmond spearhead Jack Riewoldt missed a string of chances for goal, and it took until the 16-minute mark for the Tigers to get a major, when Josh Caddy marked in the left forward pocket, ran round and converted.
Martin was under wraps early, but he showed his ability just into time on when he fended off the Adelaide defence, backed off, found Bachar Houli in space, and the midfielder kicked truly to put Richmond in the lead for the first time.
The intensity had not waned, and the Crows were not backing off. Sloane got the ball out of a pack and snapped his second, to regain the lead â€” then Hugh Greenwood added another snap to put the lead out to 11 points at quarter-time.
It was fierce early in the second, as Riewoldt finally got on the board, but he needed some sloppy defending from Adelaide, letting his kick bounce through with no one on the line.
It continued to be tight. Martin got clear at one point, and he thrilled the crowd with a trademark burst down the wing. He centred it for Riewoldt, but a step off the mark saw the Tigers blow the chance.
Eventually the Tigers put another one on, as Jacob Townsend was awarded a free in a marking contest just inside 50, and he slotted the set shot to put Richmond within two points.
The Crows had been ahead in intercept marks and contested possessions, but the Tigers kept applying pressure, and Jack Graham swooped on the ball deep in time on to kick Richmond's fifth.
A minute later the Tigers fans were up and about, as a quick foray forward found Martin to outmuscle his Crows opponent and mark and goal.
The Tigers had kicked four in a row, and suddenly Adelaide was in a spot of bother.
With Richmond up by nine at the main break, there were concerns on both sides.
Crows defender Luke Brown was off with hamstring trouble, and it had not been a good half for the captains.
Trent Cotchin had just nine touches, while Taylor Walker had been kept well out of the play on just four disposals.
The Crows had dominated the scoring in third quarters all season. But the Tigers had not got the memo.
Three minutes into the term, a free for a high tackle from Sloane saw Jack Graham kick his side's seventh.
Richmond was hammering inside 50 at every opportunity, and at the eight-minute mark, Shaun Grigg marked and kicked another.
Then 90 seconds later, when Kane Lambert added the Tigers' ninth, the lead was out to 28 points and the wave was threatening to wash the Crows away.
At the 14-minute mark, the Crows finally got clear and found Taylor Walker inside 50. The skipper held his nerve to kick the goal and keep Adelaide in it, but the momentum was lost when Graham booted his third of the game.
It was all heading one way, and in time on, Martin took possession 25m out and fed the ball out to Jason Costagna, who snapped over his shoulder.
On a day when Brandon Flowers had set the benchmark with the pre-match entertainment, it was fitting that a Tiger was there to deliver the killer blow.
The last quarter was like an extended victory lap. The Crows needed a record-breaking comeback to win, and they tried to make a game of it, kicking two goals in 90 seconds through Walker and Brad Crouch.
But the football gods would have none of it, as Townsend kicked his second and then Dan Butler added another to allow Richmond to reach the 100-point mark for the game.
It was fitting that Martin got his name on the scoresheet again in time on, raising a huge roar from the masses of Tigers fans in the stands. By this stage Richmond chief executive Brendon Gale, and former Tigers spearhead (now Channel Seven broadcaster) Matthew Richardson were in tears, as the result began to sink in.
Charlie Cameron grabbed a late consolation goal for Adelaide, but as the siren went the MCG began to resound to the strains of "We are from Tigerland", and long-suffering Richmond fans began to live their dream.
