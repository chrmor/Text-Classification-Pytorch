Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika has got the criminal case into the attack on Russian daily Kommersant's political correspondent Oleg Kashin under his control, spokeswoman for the Prosecution General's office said.
"Russia's Prosecutor General has got investigation into the attack on Kommersant's journalist Oleg Kashin under his special control. Yuri Chaika instructed Moscow's Prosecutor Yuri Syomin to coordinate the steps of the law enforcement agencies in order to solve this crime as soon as possible," Marina Gridnyova said.
Kashin was severely beaten by unknown people near his house in Moscow early on Saturday. According to a witness, the journalist was attacked by two people who were waiting for him with a bunch of flowers near his house. Neither money, nor other valuable things have been reported stolen from the journalist.
The journalist has been admitted to the intensive care unit of one of Moscow's hospitals. Kashin suffered jaw and leg fractures as a result of the beating.
The attack on Kommersant's political correspondent was probably linked to his work, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Mikhail Mikhailin said.
Kommersant is a leading Russian business newspaper owned by tycoon Alisher Usmanov, a co-owner of Russia's third-largest mobile telephone operator MegaFon and major Russian internet investor Digital Sky Technologies Ltd. (DST).
