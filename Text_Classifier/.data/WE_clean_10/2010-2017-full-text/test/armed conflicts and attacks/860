Israeli planes strike after desert attacks
GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories, Aug 19 AFP - Israeli warplanes pounded the Gaza Strip and raided the Egyptian border, killing militants blamed for coordinated gun, grenade and bomb attacks that left eight Israelis dead.
Six Israeli civilians - including two women - as well as a soldier and a police officer died after the attacks on Thursday in the desert near the Red Sea resort of Eilat. At least 26 others were injured.
Within hours of the attacks, Israel took aim at the Gaza-based militant group it accused of responsibility, launching air raids that killed six in the southern city of Rafah, medics said.
Four of the dead were top members of the Popular Resistance Committees, but one was a toddler, they said.
The identity of the sixth was unclear.
The PRC confirmed its leader and several others had been killed in the Rafah strike, and vowed bitter revenge "against everything and everyone".
