New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady breaks NFL records for career postseason passing yards, touchdowns
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady set the NFL records for career postseason passing yards and touchdowns during Saturday's AFC Divisional playoff game vs. the Baltimore Ravens.
Brady threw for more than 200 yards in the first half to pass Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning for the yardage record, though Manning will be in action on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts. Manning entered the weekend with 6,589 passing yards, while Brady had 6,424 before Saturday's game.
Brady has played in 27 playoff games, winning 18 entering Saturday. Manning has played in 23, winning 11.
Brady also eclipsed San Francisco 49ers legend Joe Montana for the most postseason passing touchdowns with 46 when he connected with Brandon LaFell on a 23-yard score with 5:13 remaining in the game. The touchdown put the Patriots ahead 35-31.
Brady grew up a fan of the 49ers, for whom Montana played 13 seasons for from 1979-92. Montana played the final two seasons of his career with the Kansas City Chiefs. He appeared in 23 postseason games, 19 with the 49ers.
Brady also threw touchdowns in the second quarter on a 15-yard pass to Danny Amendola and in the third quarter on a 5-yard toss to Rob Gronkowski.
