Darren Lockyer to call it quits
Brisbane and Australian captain Darren Lockyer has announced this season will be the last in his glittering career.
The 34-year-old, who holds the record for most appearances for Australia, most Tests as captain and most tries, broke the retirement news today.
‘‘I am still enjoying playing and am really excited about the Broncos and rest of the 2011 year,” he said.
“Of course it will be hard to leave my teammates and the Broncos’ organisation at the end of the season, but I know the timing is right.
