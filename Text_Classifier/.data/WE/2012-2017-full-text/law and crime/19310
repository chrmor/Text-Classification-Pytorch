Russians Hacked Two U.S. Voter Databases, Officials Say
One official tells NBC News that the attacks have been attributed to Russian intelligence agencies.
“This is the closest we’ve come to tying a recent hack to the Russian government,” the official said.
That person added that “there is serious concern” that the Kremlin may be seeking to sow uncertainty in the U.S. presidential election process.
Two other officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not yet concluded that the Russian government is trying to do that, but they are worried about it.
They said the Russians have long conducted cyber espionage on political targets. The question now is whether they are moving into a covert intelligence operation designed to destabilize the U.S. political process.
The alert, first reported by Yahoo News, provided IP addresses associated with the hack attempts, though it did not mention Russia.
One of the IP addresses was involved in both breaches, the FBI alert said.
“The FBI is requesting that states contact their Board of Elections and determine if any similar activity to their logs, both inbound and outbound, has been detected,” the alert said.
