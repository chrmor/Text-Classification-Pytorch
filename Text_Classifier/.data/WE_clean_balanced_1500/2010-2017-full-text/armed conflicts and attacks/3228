Baghdad area hit by more deadly Eid attacks
Bombings in and around Baghdad have killed at least 15 people, just a day after a wave of attacks during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha resulted in Iraq's highest death toll this month.
The latest violence on Sunday targeted Shia Muslims, much like the shootings and bombings a day earlier, with the spate of attacks shattering a relative calm despite announcements by authorities that they would boost security during the four-day Eid break which began on Friday.
On Sunday evening, a car bomb exploded in the mostly Shia Muslim district of Kabhumiyah in northern Baghdad, killing 13 people and wounding 28 as they were outside celebrating Eid, officials said.
Earlier on Sunday, twin bombings near a market southeast of Baghdad also killed at least two people and wounded five others.
Police officials say the simultaneous attacks on Sunday morning took place in Mada'in, located about 20km southeast of the capital, as shoppers started to arrive.
Medics in a nearby hospital confirmed the casualties. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The blasts followed a string of attacks across the country that killed nearly 40 people and wounded almost 100. Saturday was the deadliest day in nearly six weeks.
The explosions come just a day after a wave of attacks during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha resulting in Iraq's highest death toll this month.
