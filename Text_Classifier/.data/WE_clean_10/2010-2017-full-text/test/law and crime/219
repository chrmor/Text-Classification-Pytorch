Judges in Munich found Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk guilty of assisting in the murders of thousands of Jews during World War II, but ordered his release from incarceration based on his advanced age.
Demjanjuk was given a five-year prison sentence after what was believed to be one of the last trials of its kind; however, Judge Ralf Alt told the court soon after that the 91-year-old was to be freed because he was unable to travel due to his age, and because the verdict against him was not final.
The court also took into consideration the two years he spent in prison ahead of the lengthy trial, and added that he no longer posed a risk to society.
Demjanjuk rejected the opportunity to make a final statement in the state court after judges had denied requests by the defense to seek more evidence. He sat in a wheelchair wearing dark glasses as the verdict was announced to him through a translator. He showed no reaction. His defense team had said earlier that it would appeal any guilty verdict.
Prosecutors had called for Demjanjuk to serve six years for his role in the killings of 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1943. They said this would take into account the time that he has already served in jail in the United States, Israel and Germany.
The prosecution said the defendant had participated willingly in transporting death camp victims to the gas chambers.
