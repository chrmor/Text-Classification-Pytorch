In Brazil, protesters clash with police as a general strike empties schools and brings business to a halt
"Today's protest is to show that we reject the attitudes of the government, which, in my opinion, came to office in an illegitimate way and has since pushed sudden reforms and proposals that restrict the rights of Brazilian citizens," said law student Lais Dumitrescu Dias as she headed to a protest in Sao Paulo. "Everyone has the right to retire with the guarantee [they will live] life with dignity after serving their country for so many years."
