Manitoba election polls closed
Manitoba's next government is set to be determined — the voters have cast their ballots.
Voting stations across the province closed at 8 p.m. CT Tuesday, after being open for 13 hours.
The New Democratic Party is vying for a fourth term in government, under leader Greg Selinger, while the Progressive Conservatives under Hugh McFadyen are hoping to cut the NDP's tenure short.
Liberal Leader Jon Gerrard, who was the party's sole MLA when the legislature dissolved in September, is fighting not only to expand his caucus, but keep his own seat in Winnipeg's River Heights riding.
The Green Party is running 32 candidates in this election, including party leader James Beddome in Winnipeg's Wolseley area.
Elections Manitoba says about 78,600 voters  cast ballots during the advance voting period, which ran from Sept. 24 until Saturday evening. The advance polling figure is nearly double the 42,775 votes cast in the advance voting period during the last general election in May 2007.
This time, Elections Manitoba added an extra day of advance voting along with 100 more advance voting stations.
