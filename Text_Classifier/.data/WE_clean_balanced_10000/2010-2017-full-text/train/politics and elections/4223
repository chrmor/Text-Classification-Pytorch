Muammar Gaddafi reaches 41 years in power
Lybia’s ruler Muammar Gaddafi reached a total 41 years in power today(Sunday). The Lybian dictator (pictured) who dreams of uniting the African continent under his leadership has been at the helm of the Lybian presidency since  the 16th January 1970 when he became premier of Libya. He has ruled the country ever since and now holds the title ‘Colonel’. Gaddafi is now left with less than 24 months to become Africa’s longest serving ruler. At the moment the record is held by Gabon’s former President Omar Bongo, currently recorded as Africa’s longest dictator and who died at age 73 in 2009. Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe who is yet the world’s oldest ruler follows behind Gadaffi by ten years. (ZimEye, Zimbabwe)
