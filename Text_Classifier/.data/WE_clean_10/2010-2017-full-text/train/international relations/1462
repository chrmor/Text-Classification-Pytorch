Dutch aid worker kidnapped in Afghanistan
A Dutch aid worker has been kidnapped in north eastern Afghanistan, officials say.
The man, who has not been named, was abducted with his Afghan driver on the main highway in the region between Takhar and Kunduz provinces.
Witnesses said the two were taken by four armed men while driving to Kunduz province.
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says there has been a dramatic increase in militant activity in the area.
Earlier this month the governor of Kunduz province, Muhammad Omar, was killed with several others in Takhar province.
The governor of Takhar province, Abdul Jabar Taqwa, said police and intelligence officials had launched a search and rescue operation for the aid worker and his driver.
The organisation the Dutch national works for has not been named, but officials said it helps the disabled.
Last month, British aid worker Linda Norgrove was kidnapped in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan.
She died during a rescue attempt by US forces on 8 October.
In August, eight foreigners and two Afghans working with a Christian medical team were ambushed and later killed by gunmen in Badakhshan province.
