Ten die in Qld floods, 78 missing
A four-year-old boy's death during an attempt to rescue his family has taken the Queensland floods death toll to 10, with 78 people still missing.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the number of missing people had risen to 78 from 59, with grave concerns held for 18 people.
The four-year-old boy was swept away in floodwaters at Marburg, west of Brisbane.
"The best advice we have at this stage is that this boy's life was lost during an attempt to rescue him and his family," Ms Bligh told reporters on Tuesday night.
Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale said the boy had fallen out of a boat.
"We've just found out a four-year-old-boy has fallen out of a boat and they've just found the body," Mr Pisasale told the ABC.
