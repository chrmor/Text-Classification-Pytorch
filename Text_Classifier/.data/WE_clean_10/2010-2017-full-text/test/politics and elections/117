Mike Huckabee Joins Republican Presidential Race
On Tuesday, he deployed his affability in making a series of jabs at rivals that, in the mouth of another politician, could have seemed angry. He criticized candidates who deceive taxpayers and “live off the government payroll” while running for higher office — an elbow aimed at most of the current Republican field. “Have the integrity and decency to resign,” Mr. Huckabee said.
One problem for his candidacy is likely to be money. Mr. Huckabee raised just over $16 million in 2008, and despite victories in eight nominating contests saw his campaign expire for lack of funds to advertise in major states like Florida. The rules of campaign finance have changed in the new “super PAC” era, when as few as one or two super-wealthy supporters can fund an outside, parallel campaign. But it is unclear whether Mr. Huckabee has yet attracted such support.
Unusual for an announcement speech, Mr. Huckabee’s address on Tuesday included a plea for money, specifically donations of $15 or $25 a month. “I will ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren,” he said.
In recent months, Mr. Huckabee has broadened his policy focus to the threat posed by Islamic extremists, and in his announcement he criticized President Obama for putting “more pressure on our ally Israel to cease building bedrooms for their families in Judea and Samaria than we do on Iran for building a bomb.”
He has visits planned in the coming days to Iowa and South Carolina, a two-step between early nominating states with large numbers of evangelical voters. He will spend less time courting New Hampshire’s fiscal conservatives.
Should Mr. Huckabee’s campaign survive the early states, a potential bonus awaits him on March 1, when at least five conservative Southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee — are maneuvering to vote the same day. He won four of the states in 2008.
