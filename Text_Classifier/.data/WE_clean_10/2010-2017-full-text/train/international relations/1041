The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition): Daily News from Korea
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has arrived in Harbin, the capital of the Chinese province of Heilongjiang, after apparently meeting Chinese President Hu Jintao in Changchun on Friday.
Kim, Hu and other Chinese leaders stayed at the Nanhu Hotel in an apparent show of unity after international condemnation following North Korea's sinking of the South Korean Navy corvette Cheonan. A hotel staffer reported eyewitnesses as saying Hu stayed at suite No. 9 and Kim at suite No. 6.
Kim also visited Jilin Agricultural University and an agricultural exhibition center and left Changchun Railway Station on Saturday night.
He arrived in Harbin at noon on Sunday and toured agricultural and industrial facilities in the high-tech development district in downtown Harbin and also visited Taiyangdao Park on the Songhua River, according to a local source.
A large number of police were deployed and traffic was controlled in the entire downtown area all day long, the source added.
Kim stayed at the state guest house at Taiyangdao Park and attended a dinner hosted by top leaders of the Heilongjiang provincial government at the Huaqi Hotel. He is expected to start back for Pyongyang on Monday.
The Sanjiang Plain around Harbin is the "breadbasket" of China's northeast. Speculation has it that the North Korean leader is looking for ways to improve farming methods amid a food crisis in the North.
