FAA Furlough Information
Congressional authorization for several FAA programs expired at 12:01 a.m. on July 23. As a result, nearly 4,000 FAA employees are now furloughed without pay. Those employees affected by the lapse in authorization have been notified by their managers and will receive a furlough notice via FAA email.
Employees paid from the FAAs Operations account, which is funded from both the Trust Fund and the general fund, are not affected by the lack of an extension to our legislative authority. While this lapse in FAA's authorization affects thousands of public and private sector jobs, it is important to note that the safety of the flying public will not be compromised.
Employees who have not been told that they would be furloughed if FAA's authorization was not extended are expected to report to work as scheduled. We are working diligently with Congress to resolve this unfortunate situation, and apologize for the hardship this situation may cause for our employees and our stakeholders.
