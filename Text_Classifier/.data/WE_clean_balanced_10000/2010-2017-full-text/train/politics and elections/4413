The number of 'yes' voters according to Salib was 19,985,389.
More than 53,423,485 Egyptians were registered to vote in the constitution referendum that took place on 14 and 15 January, according to the SEC.
Presidential advisor for constitutional affairs Ali Saleh said shortly after the results were announced that the newly-approved charter was put in effect immediately.
The two-day vote also included clashes that led to the killing of at least nine people as security forces and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood faced-off in several governorates.
