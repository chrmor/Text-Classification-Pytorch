Chela calls it a career
Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela has decided to retire from professional tennis.
The 33-year-old played in 12 career singles finals on the ATP World Tour and captured six titles, all on clay. He also tallied three doubles titles on his preferred surface.
The lanky 6-foot-3 Chela was a three-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist, having reached the round of eight at the 2004 and 2011 French Opens and 2007 U.S. Open.
Nicknamed "El Flaco" (The Skinny One), Chela climbed as high as No. 15 in the world in 2004 and retires with a singles ranking of No. 176 and more than $6.5 million in prize money.
Chela went 12-6 in Davis Cup play for Argentina, including 10-1 on clay, and an 8-1 record on the dirt in singles. He played in the 2006 World Group final when his Argentine squad lost to Russia, 3-2.
