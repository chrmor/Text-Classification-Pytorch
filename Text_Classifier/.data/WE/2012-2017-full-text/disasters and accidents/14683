New tally shows at least 1,621 killed in Saudi hajj tragedy
The Associated Press count is more than double Saudi Arabia's official tally of 769 killed and 934 injured in the September 24 disaster in Mina, a few miles from the holy city of Mecca. Saudi officials have not updated their tally since September 26. Officials in the Saudi health and interior ministries have not responded to recent AP requests for comment. On Sunday, Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal rejected the idea of sharing the administration of the hajj with other Muslim nations, raised by regional rival Iran, saying Riyadh considers it both 'a matter of sovereignty' and a 'privilege'. The AP figure comes from state media reports and officials' comments from 19 of the over 180 countries that sent citizens to the five-day annual pilgrimage. Iran says it had 465 pilgrims killed, while Egypt lost 182, Nigeria 168 and Indonesia 126. Others include India with 114, Pakistan with 100, Bangladesh with 92, Mali with 70, Senegal with 54, Benin with 51, Cameroon with 42, Morocco with 33, Ethiopia with 31, Sudan with 30, Algeria with 25, Ghana with 12, Chad with 11, Kenya with eight and Turkey with seven. A Saudi human rights activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that he believed the government was nervous over the sharp criticism it has faced. "The way I see it is success goes to those in authority, and mistakes go to God's will," the activist said.
