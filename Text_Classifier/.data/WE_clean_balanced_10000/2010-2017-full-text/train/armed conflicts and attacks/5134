Pro-Gaddafi snipers in centre of Misrata-resident
ALGIERS, March 20 (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi continue to encircle rebel-held Misrata and have posted snipers on rooftops in the centre of the city, a resident said on Sunday.
“Snipers are still stationed on three buildings in the main street of the town. They seem to be ready to fire at anything that moves ... Nobody dares pass through that street,” the resident, called Mohammed, told Reuters by telephone.
“Misrata is quiet today but Gaddafi’s brigades are still on the outskirts, surrounding it.” (Reporting by Hamid Ould Ahmed; Writing by Christian Lowe)
