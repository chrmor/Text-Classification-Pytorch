Rocket due to deliver Facebook satellite goes up in flames at Nasa launch site in Florida
"Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation," Mr Musk tweeted. "Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon."
Dramatic footage broadcast by ABC News showed the rocket burst into a roaring ball of flame amid what appeared to be a succession of blasts - sending its payload tumbling to the ground as a dense plume of black smoke filled the air.
"At approximately 9:07am ET (1307 GMT), during a standard pre-launch static fire test for the Amos-6 mission, there was an anomaly at SpaceX's Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 resulting in loss of the vehicle," the firm said.
"Per standard operating procedure, the pad was clear and there were no injuries."
But the explosion destroyed the Israeli communications satellite that the Falcon 9 was due to deliver into orbit on Saturday - drawing a dismayed reaction from Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg.
