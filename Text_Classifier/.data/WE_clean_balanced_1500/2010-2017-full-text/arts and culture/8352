The Buggles reform for one live show
'Video Killed The Radio Star' band set for first ever live gig
The Buggles are to play their first ever live gig at a ‘reunion’ show this September.
Mainman Trevor Horn announced the news on his website Trevorhorn.com, adding that the band – who split in 1981 – will perform their debut album ‘The Age Of Plastic’ in full at the gig, which is to take place at an as-yet-unnamed venue in west London on September 28.
Horn will be joined by original bandmates Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley for the performance.
The event is being put together to raise funds for London‘s Royal Hospital For Neuro-disability, and special guests are expected.
The Buggles are best known for their 1979 single ‘Video Killed The Radio Star’, though Horn has also gone on to produce the likes of Paul McCartney and Pet Shop Boys.
