Wild winds and rain from 'weather bomb' sweep across the UK leaving thousands without power
Power has been restored to the majority of the 31,000 homes in Scotland that lost power after being struck by a storm dubbed the "weather bomb".
Energy firm SSE said electricity had been reconnected 28,000 homes by 4:30pm (local time), with a further 2,800 still without power.
The weather bomb brought wet and windy conditions which battered parts of Britain with gusts expected to reach up to 130 kilometres per hour.
Heavy rain and winds hit Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England overnight with an amber wind warning, meaning there was a potential risk to life and property, had been in place across Scotland's western Isles and northern Shetland Islands.
Britain's Met Office warned people to expect gales, storm-force winds and large waves across several parts of northern and central Britain throughout Wednesday.
"The public should be prepared for dangerous conditions, especially along causeways and coastal roads exposed to the west," it said on its website.
This time last year Britain also saw extreme weather conditions, with tens of thousands of people across the country left without electricity on Christmas Day due to torrential rainfall and hurricane winds.
