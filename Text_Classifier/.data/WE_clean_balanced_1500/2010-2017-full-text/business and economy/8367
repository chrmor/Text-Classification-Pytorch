Headlines for November 24, 2010
The Catholic Church appears to be easing its opposition to the use of condoms. In a new book, Pope Benedict endorses the use of condoms in order to prevent the spread of HIV, but the Church remains opposed to the widespread use of condoms and other forms of contraception. In South Africa, Nonkosi Khumalo of the Treatment Action Campaign criticized the Church’s record.
Nonkosi Khumalo: “I think it is a bit too late for the Catholics to now, 2010, wake up and think, 'You know, we should now say it openly and say people should use condoms,' because there has been a lot of infections that could have been prevented, that we could not prevent because we hold dearly our values in terms of what the Church expects of us. But I think it is taking us forward. I think we should welcome it. I think it is very liberal of the Catholic. I hope others would follow suit.”
