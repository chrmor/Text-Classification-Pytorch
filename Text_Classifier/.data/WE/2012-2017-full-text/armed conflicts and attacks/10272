Kirkuk bombings kill 28 as Kurds seize oil fields
Iraq's Kurdish region claimed disputed northern oilfields Friday in another blow to efforts to forge a united front against a jihadist-led onslaught, as twin bombings killed 28 people. The escalating row between Baghdad and the Kurds and the blasts in disputed Kirkuk province, which killed mostly refugees from fighting elsewhere, came just two days before a planned parliamentary session to revive flagging efforts to form a new government. The oil field takeovers come after Kurdish peshmerga fighters moved into stretches of disputed northern areas vacated by Iraqi forces during the initial militant offensive last month, and Regional President Massoud Barzani has said they will stay there. Control over Kirkuk and its oil wealth would be the realization of a long-held Kurdish dream, and Barzani's announcement this month that a referendum on independence was in the works has infuriated the Shiite Arab premier. As the Baghdad-Kurdish row deepened, Sunni militants captured multiple areas west of Anbar provincial capital Ramadi in fighting that began Thursday afternoon, killing 11 police, bombing a police station and capturing another, an officer and a doctor said.
