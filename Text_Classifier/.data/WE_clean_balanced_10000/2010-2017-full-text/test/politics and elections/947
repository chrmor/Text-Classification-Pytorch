Swedish queen to probe father's alleged Nazi ties
Walther Sommerlath's alleged links with Germany's Nazi party were first reported in 2002 by Swedish media, which claimed he joined the party in 1934 and took over a business from a Jew in 1939 under unclear circumstances.
Royal Court spokesman Bertil Ternert said on Monday the investigation was launched in reaction to the "Kalla Fakta" ("Cold Facts") TV programme that aired in November.
Ternert says the queen felt that she and her father were portrayed negatively in the program.
The results of the investigation are expected this autumn.
