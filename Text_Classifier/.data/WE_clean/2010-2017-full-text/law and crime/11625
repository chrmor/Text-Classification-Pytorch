Suspect held after 17 shot in Alabama bar
Police have arrested a suspect for an early morning shooting that left 17 injured in a bar in the southeastern US state of Alabama.
The suspect was arrested after telling an employee at a FedEx store that he was wanted for the shooting in Tuscaloosa, Sergeant Brent Blankley said.
Some reports suggest that four of those shot have been critically wounded. There were also reports that he had been charged with one count of attempted murder, and that local authorities expected other charges would be laid.
Blankley said the employee then called local police, who came to the store and arrested the suspect "without incident".
