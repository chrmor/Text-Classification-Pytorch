Japan arrests number two crime boss
The number two crime boss in Japan's biggest yakuza group has been arrested for alleged extortion as police intensify a crackdown on organised crime, police and media reports said.
Some 140 police officers took part in the arrest on Thursday of Kiyoshi Takayama, 63, of the Yamaguchi-gumi, in a pre-dawn raid on his residence in Kobe, western Japan, on suspicion of extortion, Jiji Press reported.
Takayama is the highest-ranking member of the syndicate, which is now thought to control more than 50,000 gangsters, after his boss Kenichi Shinoda, who is in prison for illegal weapons possession.
Police suspect Takayama extorted 40 million yen ($A490,000) in protection money, jointly with other Yamaguchi-gumi members, between 2005 and 2006 from a 65-year-old man engaged in the construction business.
Takayama denied the allegations, but he did not resist arrest, Jiji said.
His arrest came as police stepped up measures which came into force last year to crack down on underground syndicates, mainly the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls more than half of the nation's gangsters.
