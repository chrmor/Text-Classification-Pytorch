TV product placement makes a typically English debut
Blink and you would have missed it – which surely isn't the point of product placement.
Today was meant to mark the dawning of a new era for television advertising. For the first time in Britain, paid-for placement was allowed as a form of brand promotion.
Nescafe has handed over £100,000 to have its Dolce Gusto coffee machine placed in ITV’s This Morning’s kitchen set over the next three months.
But on its debut today – during TV chef Phil Vickery’s cooking routine, which consisted of him hand-processing bone-dry lamb into a cottage pie – only viewers setting out to look for the machine would have spied it.
The coffee maker was placed directly behind Vickery, and was visible intermittently during his brief slot.
For months, critics of product placement have warned viewers will be bombarded with the unsubtle advertising messages to which US audiences have become so accustomed. The editorial integrity of all shows tainted with such "new" advertising will disappear, the doom-mongers claimed.
Well I can reassure those critics that This Morning’s cooking segment remained entirely unsullied, with all three presenters resisting the urge to even look at the coffee machine, let alone make a hot drink with the thing.
Marketing chiefs at Nescafe surely will be praying that This Morning’s producers encourage their presenters to cast even a cursory glance at the white Dolce Gusto, which was so mournfully neglected earlier today.
The only slightly less subtle nod to the new advertising rules was a small pink ‘p’ letter, which appeared on the programme's credits, at the start of each segment after commercial breaks.
Other than that, the UK television industry’s first foray into product placement amounted to an attempt to win over sceptics – it was politely done and caused no disruption.
