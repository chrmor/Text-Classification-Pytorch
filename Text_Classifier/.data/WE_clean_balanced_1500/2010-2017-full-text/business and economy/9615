Sony: 12,700 Credit Card Numbers May Have Been Stolen
Sony has revealed that hackers may have stolen personal information from 24.6 million users of Sony Online Entertainment -- the company's site for online games like EverQuest.
Sony also admitted that an old database containing 12,700 credit card numbers fom 2007 was broken into. The information came from customers outside the U.S.
That old database also contained 10,700 debit card numbers belonging to customers in Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Spain. Sony is notifying them individually by email.
The company took Sony Online Entertainment down last night because of a problem discovered while Sony investigated last week's breach of the PlayStation Network.
It took almost a week for Sony executives to explain and apologize for the PlayStation Network breach. The company admitted that hackers may have stolen personal information from the 77 million people using the service.
