3 Arrested in Spain Are Accused of Having Links to Al Qaeda
MADRID — The Spanish government said on Thursday that it had arrested three men suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and believed to have been planning attacks in Europe.
The Spanish Interior Ministry released photographs of the three but offered only minimal details. The Associated Press, quoting the Spanish police, said that one was Russian, the second a Russian of Chechen descent and the third a Turk. They were arrested as part of a 24-hour police operation carried out between Tuesday night and Wednesday.
The Spanish interior minister, Jorge Fernández Díaz, said in an interview by telephone that the men had been in Spain for about two months and under close surveillance for several weeks. “We have clear indications that an attack was being planned, whether in Spain or another European country or even both,” Mr. Fernández Díaz said.
He would not discuss the suspects’ likely targets, but said that they had received military-style training and were “clearly not acting as lone wolves.” Among the evidence gathered by the police was “documentation about flying ultralight aircraft,” he said.
The Turk, who appeared to be acting as a facilitator, was arrested in La Línea de la Concepción, a town in southern Spain just north of Gibraltar, in a rented home where the police also found explosives, officials said. The two others were intercepted while traveling by bus near Valdepeñas in central Spain on their way from southern Spain to the northeastern border with France. At least one fiercely resisted arrest, although the minister said that no gun was fired.
