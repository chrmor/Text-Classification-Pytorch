Eleven whales saved from mass stranding
Rescuers refloated 11 beached pilot whales using a crane and body sling yesterday after a mass stranding of 58 animals on Karikari Beach in northern New Zealand.
The other 47 mammals died. Some of the survivors still appeared to be in trouble after returning to the sea. "Of the 11 whales that were released, seven appear to be in good health, while four are experiencing difficulties," said Carolyn Smith from the Department of Conservation.
