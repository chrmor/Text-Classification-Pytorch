Chris Cairns to be charged with perjury by London police
Speaking to Fairfax Media, Cairns said he was informed of the intent to lay charges at lunchtime on Friday.
"I can confirm that I have now been notified by the Crown Prosecution Service in the UK that it is their intention to lay charges against me on 25 September for perjury," Cairns said in a statement released to Fairfax Media.
"I'm obviously extremely disappointed, however, at least there will now be an opportunity to face my accusers in an open forum, with some rigour and proper process around that, so that I can clear my name once and for all. "I hope that, through this forum, significant additional information will be flushed out that will help people to better assess the situation, as well as the character and motives of the parties involved. "I wish this wasn't the situation - having been to Court before, I know what lies ahead and how gruelling it will be and how tough it is on my family - but I have nothing to hide and I will do whatever it takes to once again prove my innocence. "I will continue to co-operate fully with the authorities, including voluntarily travelling to the UK to face these changes."
Cairns, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, was awarded damages of Â£90,000 ($161,000) and legal costs of $774,000 from Modi, the ex-Indian Premier League chief who had in 2010 made an allegation of match-fixing on Twitter against the all-rounder relating to his time playing in the now defunct Indian Cricket League.
He will again find himself before a London court, however, after an ICC investigation that uncovered new match-fixing allegations against him and former international teammates Vincent and Daryl Tuffey, who also all played together at ICL team Chandigarh Lions.
