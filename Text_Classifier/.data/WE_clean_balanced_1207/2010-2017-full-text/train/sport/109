Denver Broncos WR Kenny McKinley dies at age 23; cops suspect suicide
Denver Broncos wide receiver Kenny McKinley died on Monday. He was 23.
The Arapahoe County (Colo.) sheriff's office confirmed the death, and the team announced it was "deeply saddened" after being informed.
Officials have not confirmed the cause of death. Arapahoe County sheriff Grayson Robinson told the Denver Post that McKinley's death looked like a suicide.
"It was apparently a suicide, but we're still investigating," Robinson told the paper. Robinson told the AP that detectives suspected McKinley had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
"Kenny had a promising future on the football field, but more importantly, he was a great teammate whose smile and personality could light up the room," McDaniels said in a statement. "This is a tragic loss for our football team, and his family is in all of our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time."
Steve Spurrier, who coached McKinley at South Carolina, reacted with sadnessafter learning of his former player's passing.
"It's hard to comprehend," Spurrier said. "Kenny was one of my favorite all- time players. He was a wonderful guy."
McKinley was drafted 141st overall in the fifth round in 2009. The Broncos had placed him on injured reserve on Aug. 5 with a knee ailment. He appeared in eight games for the Broncos in 2009 but did not catch any passes.
McKinley is the third Broncos player to die since 2007. On Jan. 1, 2007, Broncos CB Darrent Williams was murdered in a drive-by shooting after leaving a New Year's party. Less than two months later, RB Damien Nash collapsed and died during a charity basketball event.
