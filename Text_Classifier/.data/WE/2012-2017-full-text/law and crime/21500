FBI joining to help in AMBER Alert of Elizabeth Thomas
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has released new photos and information in the multi-state AMBER Alert of Elizabeth Thomas.
Thomas, 15, is believed to be traveling with her former teacher, 50-year-old Tad Cummins. Cummins is believed to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976-ZPT.
TBI said the investigation has revealed a "troubling" pattern of behavior by Cummins. Agents said may have been abusing his role as a teacher to "groom this vulnerable young girl for some time in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her."
The FBI has also joined in to help and a second nationwide BOLO has been issued.
A warrant has been issued for Cummins' arrest for Sexual Contact with a Minor for an alleged interaction between Cummins and Thomas at the school where he taught and where she was a student. The school district suspended Cummins when the allegations surfaced and terminated his employment Tuesday. However, a family friend and the Thomas family attorney is questioning the school's reaction time in the case.
The last known location of Thomas and Cummins was Decatur, Alabama at 3:06 p.m. Monday. So far, TBI has received 120 leads, but no credible sightings.
TBI agents have developed a timeline of some events leading up to the issue of the AMBER Alert on Tuesday evening.
TBI said Cummins secured a title loan for a personal vehicle and other personal effects several days before his disappearance, netting $4,500 in cash.
Thomas is described as a 15 year old white female with blonde hair and hazel eyes. Thomas stands about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs about 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing black leggings and a flannel shirt.
The TBI is asking the public to remain vigilant and report any information to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If anyone sees the vehicle with license plate number TN 976-ZPT, call 911.
