Zimbabwe airline workers end strike
* No disciplinary action against the workers
HARARE, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Pilots and cabin crew at Zimbabwe’s state-owned airline have agreed to end a two-week strike which grounded flights and left passengers stranded, a senior government official said on Friday.
The work boycott has affected local and international flights and the Air Zimbabwe board had threatened disciplinary measures against the workers who were demanding payment of allowances that were cut off in February.
Patison Mbiriri, Secretary in the Ministry of Transport and Communications, said the outstanding allowances would be paid and no disciplinary measures would be taken against the workers.
“All pilots have agreed to return to work and subject to operational requirements being met, normal flights are expected to resume on Friday,” Mbiriri said in a statement.
The loss-making airline has seen its passenger numbers fall more than 30 percent since 2000 due to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals and an economic crisis blamed on President Robert Mugabe’s policies, such as seizures of white-owned commercial farms for black resettlement.
The carrier is embroiled in a legal dispute over its move last year to shed 500 jobs in a bid to cut costs.
