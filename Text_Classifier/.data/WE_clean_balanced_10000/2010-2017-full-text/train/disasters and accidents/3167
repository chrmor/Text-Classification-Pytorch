Deadly Floods, Possible Tornadoes Strike Texas as Storm Sweeps Through
At least two people are dead and another two are missing after storms thundered through parts of Texas Friday, dumping more than a foot of rain on some areas and causing flash floods that trapped school buses and other vehicles, officials said.
The body of a driver who went missing in the floods was found in Travis County Friday, the county Office of Emergency Management said.
Another body was found at Joint Base San Antonio Camp Bullis in Bexar County after a driver was swept away in flood waters on Camp Bullis Road at around 6:15 a.m., base spokesman Oscar Balladares said. The driver's identity was not released, but Balladares said he was a contract employee.
Two people are missing in the Austin area: an elderly woman last seen at her home and a 37-year-old man last seen in his car on the state highway, according to the Travis County Sheriff's Department.
