ABC News Crew Hijacked, Threatened With Beheading in Egypt (VIDEO)

An ABC News crew was carjacked and threatened with beheading Thursday in Egypt. Correspondent Brian Hartman, cameraman Akram Abi-hanna and two other ABC News employees were surrounded on a crowded road that leads from Cairo's airport to the city's downtown area. "A man in police uniform came up to me and said, 'So help me God.... I am going to cut off your head,'" Hartman said.  One man was yelling, "Cut their necks now, cut their necks now," and another pointed an imaginary gun at Hartman and made shooting noises. Hartman says that Abi-hanna, who is Lebanese, was able to appeal to their captors to not beat or kill them.   "We thought we were goners," Hartman said of the men, who were standing under a large banner of embattled president Mubarak. "We absolutely thought we were doomed."   He Twittered: "Just escaped after being carjacked at a checkpoint and driven to a compound where men surrounded the car and threatened to behead us... The men released us only after our camera man appealed to the generous spirit of the Egyptian people, hugging and kissing an elder.” Minutes later, ABC News anchor Christiane Amanpour and her team were surrounded and interrogated by a threatening crowd in Cairo. She faced a similar attack Wednesday. "We are assessing the security situation literally on a minute to minute basis. Our priority is to ensure the safety of all of our staff in the field," said Jeffrey Schneider, senior vice president of ABC News. Hotel rooms for NBC, BBC and Fox staffers have been ransacked. Sources told Time magazine that Lara Logan, chief foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News, has been detained along with her crew by Egyptian police outside Cairo's Israeli embassy. The news comes shortly after it was revealed two Fox News journalists were hospitalized after being beaten savagely while dodging a Molotov cocktail. Anderson Cooper waspunched 10 times in the head Wednesday.
