Our troops have entered the town of Lysychansk and occupied its northern districts,” Lysenko said at a Thursday briefing.
The rebels who stayed in the town “found themselves blocked, the path for retreatment has been cut off for them,” he said.
Also, the Ukrainian military seized control over the village of Verkhniokamianske in Donetsk region, he said.
“Efforts are under way to check the former place where militants were staying and to demine territories in the liberated districts. Efforts continue to detect subversive groups. The encirclement and blocking of the regional centers, Donetsk and Luhansk, continues,” Lysenko said.
Also, two men were arrested in Mariupol on suspicion of being involved in the storming of the local administration and the attack on the Mariupol office of the Ukrainian Interior Minister Ministry in the Donetsk region, he said. The suspects were carrying small-arms weapons which they seized from law enforcers during fighting. They were also found in possession of a large amount of ammunition and bullet-proof vests, Lysenko said.
