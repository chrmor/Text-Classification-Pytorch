Denmark gets a new coalition government as the centre-right liberal party Venstre joins forces with the Conservative People's Party and the libertarian-leaning Liberal Alliance whose leader, Anders Samuelsen, becomes Denmark's sixth foreign minister in six years. (The Local)Icelandâ€™s incumbent, centre-right Independence Party surprised pollsters by winning 29 percent of the vote (21 seats), thereby putting leader Bjarni Benediktsson in position to organize another coalition government. The Progressive Party, the current ruling partner, garnered 11.5% and eight positions, a loss of 11 seats. The new Pirate Party didn't perform as predicted with 14.5% of the ballots, though it did get 10 seats, an increase of seven more positions in the 63-seat parliament (Althing).
