Palestinian Prisoners in Israel Protest After Inmate Dies
JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners staged protests in Israeli jails on Tuesday as the Palestinian leadership accused Israel of deliberately delaying the treatment of a fellow prisoner who died that morning of cancer.
Maysara Abu Hamdiya, 64, a retired general in the Palestinian Authority security services, died in a hospital in southern Israel two months after receiving a diagnosis of throat cancer. Mr. Hamdiya was detained by Israel in 2002, at the height of the second Palestinian uprising, and was serving a life term for attempted murder after sending a suicide bomber to a cafe in Jerusalem, Israeli officials said. The bomb failed to detonate.
Mr. Hamdiya’s death came amid efforts by the Western-backed Palestinian leadership to place the prisoner issue high on the diplomatic agenda, with the Obama administration calling for a renewal of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Emotions over the prisoner issue have been running high among the Palestinian public in recent months, leading to protests in support of prisoners on hunger strikes and over the death of a prisoner in February under disputed circumstances.
The Palestinian Authority said Mr. Hamdiya had been suffering severe throat pain since August. In the days and weeks leading up to his death, Palestinian representatives blamed Israel for procrastinating in his diagnosis and treatment as they pressed for his early release.
Sivan Weizman, a spokeswoman for the Israel Prison Service, said that Mr. Hamdiya had been under medical supervision and that a committee would examine the circumstances of his death, as in all cases of prisoners dying in custody. Ms. Weizman added that the prison service had applied to a parole board for an early release for Mr. Hamdiya about a week ago, once it was clear that his illness was terminal.
