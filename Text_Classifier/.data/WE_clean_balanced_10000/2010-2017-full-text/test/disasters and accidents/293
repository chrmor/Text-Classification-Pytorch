Polish Train Crash Kills 16
BERLIN — The death toll in the high-speed, head-on collision of two passenger trains in Poland rose to 16 people on Sunday, with the authorities asking how both ended up on the same track.
Prosecutors said that they had opened an investigation, but it was not immediately clear what caused the accident, and they had not ruled out human error. The stretch of track where the collision occurred was modernized last year, the transportation minister, Slawomir Nowak, said.
“We need to wait for a detailed report of an independent commission,” Mr. Nowak told reporters at the scene, “then we will need to calmly take a stand.”
The crash, which occurred outside the town of Szczekociny, north of Krakow, was the worst such accident in Poland in more than 20 years. The trains were carrying about 350 people when they collided shortly after 9 p.m. on Saturday. In addition to the fatalities, 58 passengers were injured, many seriously, the authorities said.
An American woman was among those killed, said Benjamin Ousley Naseman, a spokesman for the United States Consulate in Krakow. Her family had been notified, but the woman’s name had not been released, pending an official list of the victims that the Polish authorities were putting together.
