CAIRO: At least 20 people were killed in clashes with security forces across Egypt on Friday as nationwide anti-government protests raged for a fourth straight day, medics and witnesses told AFP.
At least 13 people were killed and 75 injured in anti-government protests in the canal city of Suez, a hospital source told AFP.
In Cairo, at least five people were killed and several hundred injured.
“Until now, five people are dead and several hundred have been injured,” a medic told AFP as more wounded were being ferried into Qasr al-Aini hospital in central Cairo. The toll applied to those at Qasr al-Aini hospital alone.
