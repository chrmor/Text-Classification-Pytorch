Five dead as landslide hits Malaysian orphanage
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - An avalanche of mud smashed into an orphanage in Malaysia killing at least five children, police said, after heavy monsoon rains lashed the capital Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas on Saturday.
Police said eight children had been rescued from under the mud that partly covered the orphanage in the central state of Selangor, which borders the capital.
But seven children remained missing after the landslide, which struck on Saturday afternoon, the country’s police chief Ismail Omar said.
“The rains are making rescue work difficult as the mud is still moving,” he told Reuters.
The children were taking part in a motivational camp at the orphanage when the landslide struck, local media said.
