Video: Palestinian prisoners enter day 74 of hunger strike
Humanitarian organisation Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) expressed concern about prisoners Bilal Diab and Thaer Halahleh as they began their 74th day without food on Friday.
An estimated 1,600 out of 4,800 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails stopped taking food on April 17 demanding better conditions, an end to administrative detention and solitary confinement and more family visits.
Diab and Halahleh, two of six prisoners to have refused food for between 49 and 74 days according to PHR, were among the first wave of inmates whose initial refusals to accept food prompted the mass hunger strike.
The scope of the strike has posed a new challenge to Israel, which has come under international criticism over detentions without trial and could face a violent Palestinian backlash if any of the protesters die.
At the PHR offices in Tel Aviv, the director of the Prisoners and Detainees department said Halahleh's life was in "immediate danger."
"His doctor told him that his life is in immediate danger and that he could die any moment and what is very worrisome is the fact that he said that he doesn't want to be saved if something happens to him and he loses consciousness. he doesn't want resuscitation," Anat Litvin said, adding that the organisation believed that the prisoners did not have access to adequate equipment or expertise.
The fate of the hunger strikers has touched a nerve in the Palestinian territories with daily demonstrations in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip to support the movement.
On Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad was pressed to do more by demonstrators gathered in Ramallah.
A day later, a candlelit vigil was held in the city's main square to show support for those prisoners who remain on hunger strike.
