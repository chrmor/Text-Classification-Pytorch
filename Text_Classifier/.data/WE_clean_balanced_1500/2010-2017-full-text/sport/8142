Mexico Wins Soccer Gold Medal
Two goals from striker Oribe Peralta fired Mexico to a 2-1 win over tournament favorite Brazil in the menâ€™s soccer gold medal game at Wembley on Saturday. The game was barely 30 seconds old when Peralta seized a hasty pass from Rafael da Silva, ran into the penalty area and shot past Gabriel.
Brazil coach Manolo Menezes made a key substitution after 30 minutes, sending on Hulk for the ineffective Alex Sandro, after which the Brazilians looked a more potent attacking force.
The longer the game wore on, though, the greater the chance of a second Mexico goal appeared. It arrived in the 75th minute, when Peralta headed home a Marco Fabian free kick. Hulk halved the deficit in stoppage time, and Oscar headed over the bar in the dying seconds.
The victory gave Mexico its first soccer gold medal. For Brazil the wait continues.
