Russian government to sell media outlets
All the newspapers, television channels and radio stations owned by members of the Russian government will be put up for sale.
Presidential aide Arkady Dvorkovich made the announcement following a speech by President Dmitry Medvedev in which he said that public figures should not be the owners of "factories, newspapers and steamships."
"They are to be sold, but the date hasn't been established yet," Dvorkovich was quoted as saying.
That would be some sell-off because it is estimated that around 80% of Russia's regional press is currently owned by the corresponding local authorities.
Though Dvorkovich talked of the need to focus on nurturing an independent media, sales may be triggered because of the high cost of running papers and TV channels.
