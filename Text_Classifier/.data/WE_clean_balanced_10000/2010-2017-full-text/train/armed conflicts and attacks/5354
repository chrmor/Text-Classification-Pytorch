Two die in Kazakhstan car blast
A blast tore through a car on Tuesday outside a security service building in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, killing two people in the second such incident in the usually stable Central Asian nation in a week.
Initial reports attributed the blast to a suicide bomber but the ex-Soviet republic's interior ministry later played down the terror link.
The interior ministry said in a statement that two people died after a "spontaneous explosion" tore through the car.
"These circumstances point to the absence of signs that this was an act of terror," the ministry statement said.
The blast coincided with a visit to Kazakhstan's capital by Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian president of Belarus who is negotiating an emergency loan for his ex-Soviet state.
Initial reports said the blast happened at 3.40am local time, outside the headquarters of the security services but officials later said it was outside a detention centre run by the security services.
