Box Office: 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' Tops 'Avatar' to Become No. 1 Film of All Time in North America
It's official: J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the highest-grossing film of all time in North America, not accounting for inflation.
On Wednesday, the Disney and Lucasfilm mega-blockbuster overtook the $760.5 million earned by James Cameron'sAvatar.Force Awakens — which grossed $6.2 million for the day for a domestic total of $764.4 million — achieved the milestone in only 20 days in release, a remarkable feat.
Released in December 2009, Avatar grossed nearly $750 million in its original, seven-month run, plus another $10 million-plus when it was rereleased in theaters.
Thanks to Force Awakens, domestic revenue for 2015 hit a record $11 billion at the last minute. The movie has broken numerous records, including biggest domestic opening ($247.9 million), biggest global debut ($529 million), fastest film to reach $100 million (24 hours), $200 million (three days), $300 million (five days), $400 million (eight days), $500 million (10 days), $600 million (12 days), and $700 (16 days).
Other domestic records include biggest second weekend of all time ($149.2 million), biggest third weekend ($90.2 million), biggest Thursday preview gross ($57 million), biggest Christmas Day ($49.3 million), biggest New Year's Day ($34.4 million), highest location average for a wide debut ($59,982) and biggest opening week ($390.9 million).
Globally, Force Awakenshas a long way to go before eclipsing the $2.78 billion earned worldwide by Avatar, even as it does staggering business. Through Wednesday, its worldwide tally is $1.58 billion — but that doesn't include China, where Force Awakens lands on Jan. 9.
Overseas on Wednesday, Force Awakens earned $13.1 million to cross the $800 million mark with a total $812.2 million.
Many box-office observers suggest theStar Wars reboot will ultimately gross $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion worldwide, passing up Cameron's Titanic ($2.19 billion) to become the No. 2 film of all time, not accounting for inflation. Already, it's at No. 4.
Only two films have earned $700 million or more in North America: Avatar and Force Awakens.
