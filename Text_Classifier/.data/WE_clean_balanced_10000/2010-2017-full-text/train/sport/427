Worawi Makudi takes legal action against Lord Triesman
Thailand's football chief is set to take legal action against Lord Triesman after the former Football Association chairman implicated him in an alleged World Cup bribery scandal.
Triesman stated that Worawi Makudi had demanded the TV rights for a proposed friendly between England and Thailand in return for his 2018 World Cup vote.
Makudi said he had a "very strong case" and that the claims were "groundless".
"I will present evidence to prove these allegations are not true," he added.
"I don't know why they were made."
Makudi was one of four men accused by former FA chairman Lord Triesman of seeking bribes in return for backing England's failed 2018 World Cup bid.
The FA has appointed a leading lawyer to review the allegations, while Triesman says he now plans to take his evidence to world governing body Fifa.
Meanwhile, Makudi also insisted he is still president of the Football Association of Thailand, despite reports on Friday saying the Sports Authority of Thailand had removed him from the post for failing to hold an election for the presidency in time.
"I am still holder of the position and we will reschedule the election," he added.
