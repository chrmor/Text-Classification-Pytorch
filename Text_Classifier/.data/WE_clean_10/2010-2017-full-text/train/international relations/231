Secret service agents sent home over drunken incident in Amsterdam
Three members of president's guard disciplined after one of them was found intoxicated in a hotel
Three agents from the US secret service were sent home from Amsterdam over a drunken incident in a hotel, a day before Barack Obama arrived in the Netherlands. The service, which provides the president's bodyguards, said they were sent home for disciplinary reasons on Sunday, the day before Obama's arrival. A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that one agent was found intoxicated by staff at a hotel who reported it to the US embassy. The other two agents were implicated for not intervening in their colleague's behaviour.
The Washington Post first reported the incident. It comes as the services works to repair its reputation over previous misconduct cases including a prostitution scandal.
An inspector general's report in December concluded there was no evidence of widespread misconduct, in line with the service's longstanding assertion that it has no tolerance for inappropriate behaviour.
The agents sent home from Amsterdam were placed on administrative leave, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper said all three were on the counter-a-Assault team, which defends the president if he comes under attack, and that one agent was a "team leader"
The service said the incident had not compromised Obama's security. He left the Netherlands late on Tuesday for Brussels.
