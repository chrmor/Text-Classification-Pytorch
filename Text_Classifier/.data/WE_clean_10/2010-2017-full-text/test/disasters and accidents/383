Search Ends for 7 Missing From Sunken Boat
The U.S. Coast Guard is ending aerial searches for seven Americans still missing after a charter fishing boat sank off Mexico.
The Coast Guard says its search on Tuesday of a 803 square-mile (2,080 square-kilometer) area of the Sea of Cortez by a C-130 Hercules aircrew would be its last.
Rear Admiral Joseph Castillo said the 11th division's "deepest sympathies go out to the friends and families of the missing men."
Baja California state Civil Protection Director Alfredo Escobedo Ortiz said small Mexican naval craft and other fishermen would continue searching for bodies or survivors.
The boat went down on July 3. Nineteen U.S. tourists and 16 Mexican crew members made it to land. One was found drowned on a remote island beach. The others remain missing.
