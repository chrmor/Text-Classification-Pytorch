The German film agency FSK (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Movie Industry) permits the showing of the reportedly anti-Israel and anti-Semitic Turkish film, Valley of the Wolves: Palestine, with an over 18 age restriction, saying it contains “propaganda tendencies” and “repetitive violence.” The film, based on events surrounding last May's Gaza flotilla raid, has opened in cinemas in Turkey and Austria.
