Suicide Bomber Kills 3 in Nigeria
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device strapped to her body near a market in the northeastern Nigerian State of Borno, killing at least three people, police and civilian vigilante sources said on Saturday.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack that bore the hallmarks of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has conducted a six-year insurgency to carve out a caliphate in Nigeria’s northeast.
A vigilante source said four people were killed and seven injured when the explosive went off at a checkpoint at the entrance of the Ramirgo market.
“Three persons including the suicide bomber died on the spot. Corpses and injured victims evacuated to General hospital,” Aderemi Opadokun, the Borno State police commissioner, told Reuters in a text message.
A military spokesman, Sani Kukasheka Usman, confirmed the blast and said the suicide bomber had been on the way to attack the market when she was stopped by a vigilante.
