Presidential Office condemns violence after Ma hit by book
Taipei, Sept. 26 (CNA) The Presidential Office said Friday that any form of violence should be condemned after President Ma Ying-jeou was hit by a book thrown by a member of a political group. Presidential Office spokeswoman Ma Wei-kuo said the president respects the rights of the public to express their views rationally, but any forms of violence should be condemned. The incident occurred as President Ma was preparing to leave after attending a reception for international franchise chains at the Grand Hotel. The media was waiting to ask him for his response to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's advocacy of a "one country, two systems" formula to deal with Taiwan when a man in a black shirt launched his attack. Shouting "Taiwan and China, one country on each side," he hurled the book "Formosa Betrayed" at Ma, with the book getting a piece of the president. The young man was overtaken by bodyguards, and police asked him to leave the venue after identifying him. Flanc Radical, a Kaohsiung-based group, later posted an item on Facebook identifying the man as Yen Ming-wei, director of the group's joint campaign headquarters and a freshman at National Sun Yat-sen University.
