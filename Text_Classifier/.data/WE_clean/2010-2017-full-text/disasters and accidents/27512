LA County board declares local state of emergency in fight against Sand fire – Daily News
With fast-moving flames continuing to burn tens of thousands of acres in and around the Santa Clarita Valley, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to declare a local state of emergency to bolster resources to help fight the now five-day-old Sand fire.
The fire has charred more than 37,000 acres, forced 20,000 people to evacuate, destroyed 18 homes and caused one death.
“The Sand fire is considered unprecedented by fire officials,” Supervisor Michael Antonovich said. “There is a need to take immediate action.”
A copy of the the county’s proclamation will be forwarded to the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and is the first step toward asking the state for funding to help residents and the community.
In addition, U.S. Rep. Steve Knight. R-Palmdale, asked Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency as well.
“The historic drought Los Angeles County is enduring this year has created disastrous conditions for managing wildfires,” Knight wrote in his letter to Brown. “The Sand fire threatens to compound economic effects of the drought while inflicting tremendous stress on public resources and individual families who are displaced from their communities.”
Later in the morning, Antonovich filed a motion asking that the fire chief and county CEO evaluate the possibility of buying a Superscooper along with additional helicopters to augment the county’s fire-fighting arsenal. Right now, the craft are leased from Canada, and Antonovich announced the specialty craft would be in Los Angeles on Monday.
The so-called Superscooper, called a Bombardier 415, runs about $37 million, but is able to grab 1,620 gallons in 12 seconds. They are here early September through the end of November, a period traditionally designated as Southern California’s prime fire season.
The drought has extended wildfire season to 12 months, Antonovich said, which is why the Superscoopers are needed.
“As a result of the County’s 52-week fire season, it is vital that we maintain the best arsenal and resources to protect life and property,” Antonovich said.
Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby told the board that the upcoming report will include an assessment of the helicopters the county owns, a discussion about replacement as well as expansion because of the drought.
As of Tuesday, 3,048 firefighters from Los Angeles County as well as departments statewide were attacking the fire. Resources include 335 engines, 58 hand crews, 18 water tenders, 26 helicopters and 20 dozers, according to incident command officials.
“All of our mutual aid are participating,” Osby said, adding that California is a model for the world in relation to fighting wildfires. “What makes California unique is really an effort that has helped us save more property and save more lives.”
Osby is expected to report back to the board within the next few weeks.
