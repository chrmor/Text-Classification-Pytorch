Students to demonstrate against hike in college fees
Students from around the country are making their way to Dublin this morning for a major protest against any increase to university fees.
Thousands of students are expected to take part in the march from Parnell Square to Government Buildings.
The Government is reported to be considering a doubling of registration charges to â‚¬3,000 from next September - a move the Union of Students in Ireland says will cause students to drop out of college.
