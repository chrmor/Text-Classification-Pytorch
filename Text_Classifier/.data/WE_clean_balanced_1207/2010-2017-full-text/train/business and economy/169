No Disruption Noted After Some Cabbies Strike
Some but not all of Chicago's taxi drivers went on strike during the Monday morning rush hour to protest a new set of city regulations that took effect Monday.
Some of the city's nearly 6,700 cabs weren't up and running, according to reports. There were no reports, however, of disruption to service across the city or to airports.
The group United Taxi Drivers Community Council said cabbies are upset over the new rules that limit drivers to a 12-hour work day and charge 30 percent more to lease cabs.
They said they haven't received a fare increase in years and plan to strike every Monday until an increase is permitted.
A fare hike has long been rumored to be considered and the City Council could hear the request toward the end of this summer.
Until then the City Council approved a permanent $1 surcharge for fuel, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement he believes the new regulations will result in "safer drivers, cleaner cabs and better options for patrons."
"Until those reforms are fully implemented, it is premature to talk about charging more for a ride."
