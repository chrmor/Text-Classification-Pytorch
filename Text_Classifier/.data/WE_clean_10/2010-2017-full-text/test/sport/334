Danny Willett wins the Green Jacket by three strokes after Jordan Spieth meltdown; Shane Lowry, Davis Love III and Louis Oosthuizen shoot holes in one 
Willett has had to scramble at the ninth, landing in the pine needles off the tee to the left then drilling his second shot into the patrons to the right of the green. he chips out above the on where the ball bites and leaves him a very awkward 6ft downhiller to save par. 
Smylie Kaufman, meanwhile, has had some par-saving of his own to accomplish on four, five and six and managed it each time. The toll it must take on the nerves, though and he slips up at the 7th with three putts to drop the stroke he had threatened to lose at each of the past three holes.
