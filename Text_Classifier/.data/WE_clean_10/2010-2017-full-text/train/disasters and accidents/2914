10 crushed at bar in South Africa
Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten people were crushed to death Saturday in a South African township bar packed with New Year's revelers, police said.
The 47-year-old owner of the tavern was arrested and charged with culpable homicide, said police spokeswoman Capt. Adele Myburgh.
Police were alerted early Saturday morning to the bar in Ipelegeng Township, about a three-hour drive from Johannesburg, and are investigating the incident, Myburgh said.
It was unclear what happened. Witnesses, Myburgh said, "have told us more than one story."
No other details were available.
