Former state auditor arrested in influence-peddling scandal
SEOUL, May 30 (Yonhap) -- A former state auditor and aide to President Lee Myung-bak was arrested Monday on charges of taking bribes from a now-suspended savings bank that was seeking his influence to avoid punishment for extending illegal loans and other irregularities. Eun Jin-soo, who resigned last week as a ranking member of the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), is accused of accepting 70 million won (US$64,635) in cash and a diamond jewel worth about 30 million won from Busan Savings Bank. His brother is also suspected of taking 100 million won from the bank.
