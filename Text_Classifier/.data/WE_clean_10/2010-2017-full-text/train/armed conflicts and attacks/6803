Twin blasts kill police officer in northwestern Pakistan
A Pakistani police official says a twin bombing has killed a police officer and wounded nine people in northwestern Peshawar city.
Police official Sher Khan says a roadside explosion hit first on Wednesday on the outskirts of the city. Then the second bomb went off about half an hour later, after police and local TV crews arrived at the scene.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The area has long been a center of Islamic militancy in Pakistan and Peshawar itself has seen several large-scale militant attacks.
Khan says some members of the media crews were among the wounded.
