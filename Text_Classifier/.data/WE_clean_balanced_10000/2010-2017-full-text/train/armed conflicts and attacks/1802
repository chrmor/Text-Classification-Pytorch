Gaza borders closed for weekend
GAZA (Ma'an) -- Israeli crossings authorities operating on the Gaza borders informed their Palestinian counterparts on Friday that the borders would not be open for goods transport that day.
While crossings are scheduled to open on Friday, the Muslim holy day, Israeli officials have announced their closure every week since August 2009, barring one where emergency fuel supplies were delivered at the request of officials.
Palestinian crossings official Raed Fattouh said he was told that crossings would shut Friday, stay closed on Saturday for the scheduled closure and re-open on Sunday.
