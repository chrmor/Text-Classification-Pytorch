'Firebomb' attack on Hong Kong metro leaves 19 injured, three critically
Three people remain in critical condition after an alleged firebomb attack on the Hong Kong metro, which hurt at least 16 other commuters. 
One man, Cheung Kam-fai, 60, was arrested following the incident at Tsim Sha Tsui station, on the Tsuen Wan Line, during the Friday evening rush hour.
He has now been charged with arson. 
Police District Commander Kwok Pak-chung said as the suspect was being taken to a hospital, he told rescuers that he was the one who set the fire, and that he had done so for an unspecified personal reason. 
"He was incoherent," Mr Kwok said, adding that police believe he used a flammable liquid.
Officials said there was no evidence to indicate the fire was a terror attack. 
The youngest victim is Audrey Ko, a 15-year-old student who suffered burns to her legs, the South China Morning Post reported. 
Footage posted to social media showed a chaotic and confused scene at the station. 
Fires burned inside a train carriage and commuters used clothes to try and put out flames on a man’s legs. 
The station was closed after the fire but reopened a day later. 
In the aftermath of the incident, it emerged that only around 50 per cent of Hong Kong metro trains are fitted with CCTV. 
The carriage the fire took place on was not fitted with a camera and it is feared this could hamper the investigation.
