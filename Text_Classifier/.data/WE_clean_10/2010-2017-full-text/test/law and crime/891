Public schools in LA to reopen Wednesday after 'hoax'
Public schools in Los Angeles are to reopen on Wednesday after a terror threat authorities now believe to be a hoax.
More than 1,000 schools were closed after an email was sent to a school board member.
Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren were sent home after a threatened attack "with bombs and assault rifles".
The email was routed through Germany but it is thought it originated locally.
