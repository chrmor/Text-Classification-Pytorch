3 soldiers killed, 3 injured in anti-terror ops in Hakkari
Three soldiers have been killed, and three others have been injured in clashes with PKK terrorists during anti-terror operations in southeastern Çukurca district near the Iraqi border, reports said on Friday.
According to reports, the clashes took place near a mountainous region on the Turkey-Iraq border.
The military immediately retaliated by airstrikes, which reportedly killed many terrorists. Renewed violence in Turkey has come in the wake of the July 20 Suruç bombing which was allegedly carried out by Daesh and left dozens of people dead. The subsequent PKK-linked murder of two Turkish police officers at their home sparked a new wave of conflict in the country. The Turkish government has intensified its counterterror operations following the recent attacks carried out by the PKK, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the EU and Turkey. Formed in 1978, the terrorist group has been fighting the Turkish government for an independent state until the early 2000's. The group then shifted its goal to autonomy in predominately Kurdish inhabited regions of Turkey.
