Baftas 2013 – as it happened
The Baftas are done, so let us briefly recap.
I think that just about covers it. It was a deadly evening for the highly fancied Lincoln (which must be content with a solitary award for Daniel Day-Lewis) and a decent one for Les Miserables, which remains in contention for Oscar glory at the end of the month. But it was a tremendous night for Ben Affleck's Argo, which picked up a crop of statues, including director and film.
And if that doesn't make the stars of Les Misérables feel sick, I'm not sure what will (apart from Sally Field, allegedly).
That's it from this year's British Academy film awards. Thanks for sticking with me. Now onward to the Oscars.
