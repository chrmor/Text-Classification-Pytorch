Three Canadians are on board.
The search, in mountainous terrain about 450 kilometres north of the South Pole, was suspended overnight due to strong wind and heavy snow.
The New Zealand Search and Rescue Coordination Centre says the weather has improved and a plane has been sent in.
It is flying over the area where an emergency locator beacon was activated late on Wednesday.
The missing Twin-Otter was operated by Canadian company, Kenn Borek Air.
Its pilot is said to be highly experienced in polar flight.
The rescue centre says the plane was carrying emergency equipment and supplies for five days.
Helicopters are on standby to take in a ground search team.
