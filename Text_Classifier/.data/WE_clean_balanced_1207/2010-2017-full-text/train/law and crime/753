Cambodia's anti-corruption law nails 1st target
A senior provincial official has been sentenced to 19 years in prison, becoming the first person convicted under Cambodia's anti-corruption law. State prosecutor Pong Chan Soyutheara said Tob Chan Sereivuth, a former prosecutor in Pursat province, was convicted Thursday of extortion and accepting bribes to release timber smugglers. He said three men who worked with Chan Sereivuth were sentenced to 15, 16 and 18 years, respectively, on extortion charges and ordered them to pay compensation to the victims. All four were arrested late last year, just months after the anti-corruption act became law. Cambodia, a poor country heavily dependent on foreign aid, is routinely listed by groups such as Transparency International as one of the most corrupt in Asia.
