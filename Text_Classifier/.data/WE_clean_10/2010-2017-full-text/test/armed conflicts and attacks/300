Libya rebels pushed back from town south of Tripoli
BIR-AYYAD, Libya, July 1 (Reuters) - Libyan rebels were on Friday pulling back from their positions outside the town of Bir al-Ghanam, 80 km (50 miles) south of Tripoli, after coming under rocket attack, a Reuters photographer in the area said.
The photographer said government forces based inside Bir al-Ghanam were firing at the rebels using Russian-made Grad rockets, which were landing as far away as the village of Bir-Ayyad, 30 km to the south. (Reporting by Anis Mili; Writing by Christian Lowe)
