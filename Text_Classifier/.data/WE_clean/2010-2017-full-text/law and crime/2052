Federal judge orders military to stop enforcing 'don't ask, don't tell'
A federal judge in California ordered the military to stop enforcing the "don't ask, don't tell" policy against gay servicemembers.
District Court Judge Virginia Phillip ordered the military "immediately to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation or other proceeding that may have been commenced under the 'don't ask, don't tell,'" CNN writes.
Last month, she ruled that the policy was unconstitutional because it violated servicemembers' Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. She delayed issuing the injunction until today.
The gay political group Log Cabin Republicanssued the Pentagon. The government is likely to appeal.
