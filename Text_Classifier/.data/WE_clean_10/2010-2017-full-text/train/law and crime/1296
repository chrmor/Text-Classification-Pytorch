Pretoria - Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ordered to remain in South Africa pending the finalisation of an application for the South African government to arrest him, the High Court in Pretoria ruled on Sunday.
Judge Hans Fabricius ordered that he be prohibited from leaving South Africa, and that the Department of Home Affairs ensure the order is sent to every port of entry and exit in South Africa.
He ordered that there be proof of service of the order and the identity of each person it is served on.
This varied an order he handed down earlier, after the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) said home affairs officials at OR Tambo International Airport refused to accept his earlier order that Al-Bashir not leave until the case had been heard.
It was postponed to 11:30 on Monday to give the government more time to prepare. Their papers had to be filed with Fabricius by 09:00 on Monday.
Al-Bashir is attending the African Union Summit in South Africa. The SALC wants him arrested in terms of 2 warrants issued by the International Criminal Court on allegations of war crimes and genocide in Darfur.
