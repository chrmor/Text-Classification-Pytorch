Suu Kyi, party put Myanmar parliament debut on hold over oath issue
Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party are delaying their parliamentary debut Monday as they seek to resolve a problem concerning the wording of the oath that lawmakers have to take.
Suu Kyi and 42 other candidates from her party, the National League for Democracy, won seats in by-elections on April 1, a result welcomed by the United States and Britain as a sign of progress toward democracy in Myanmar after decades of repressive military rule.
But they have requested that the wording of the swearing-in oath that lawmakers have to take be changed. The National League for Democracy asked the authorities to adjust the wording of the oath to say that parliamentarians will "abide by" the constitution rather than "protect" it.
"Whether Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi enters parliament or not is her decision," the president said Monday. "She has to decide it. The parliament is all in favor of her entrance and very welcoming of her."
"Myanmar is only at the beginning of its transition," Ban told reporters. "Many challenges lie ahead. Many concerns have yet to be addressed. Yet I am convinced that we have an unprecedented opportunity to help the country advance toward a better future. That is why, today, I am announcing that I have accepted an invitation from President Thein Sein to visit Myanmar."
He said he looks forward to "personally congratulating" Sein and Suu Kyi on this trip. "Working together, they have come far," he said. "Working together, I am confident that they will go further still. And together, we will explore the many tangible and practical ways in which the U.N. can help."
The decision by the European Union to suspend most of its sanctions against Myanmar came Monday at the foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg. Only a ban on arms exports continues, according to the EU.
Still, an expert stressed it will take time for the easing of sanctions to have any impact on those on the ground, living hand to mouth.
"On the day-to-day basis, nothing will change for the average person on the streets. These things take time. Manufacturing investment is what will drive this country forward," said Tony Picon, associate director at Colliers International, a real estate company.
One such person who might not feel change anytime soon is Ko Tin Lwin. He can earn up to $2 a day, or he can earn nothing, depending on whether he can find work when he shows up each day at the bustling Yangon port.
"I send 1,000 kyat ($1.20) a day back to my family in the countryside," Lwin said while waiting for another ship to arrive. "It only covers their food, nothing more, and I have to worry for tomorrow."
"These reforms will need time to implement and to bear fruit. The foundation for development is legitimate government, the rule of law and national reconciliation," the statement said. "The EU praises the peaceful nature of the process and the readiness of the parties to work towards the same goals, with a shared vision for political, social and economic reforms."
Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory the previous time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. But the junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest.
