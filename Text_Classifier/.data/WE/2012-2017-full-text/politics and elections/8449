Iran threatens counter measure to Senate's proposed new sanctions
The threatened sanctions would force further reductions in Iran's oil sales, to almost zero, and would penalize some sectors of Iran's economy that so far escaped sanctions. They also seek to set minimum terms for the nuclear deal the six countries are seeking and would require the United States to join in military action to protect Israel it if starts a war with Iran.
