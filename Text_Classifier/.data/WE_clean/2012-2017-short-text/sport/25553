In the NBA, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics swap All-Star point guards, with Isaiah Thomas going to the Cavaliers and Kyrie Irving to the Celtics. The Celtics also send the Cavaliers forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Žižić, and a 2018 first-round draft pick that they had previously obtained from the Brooklyn Nets. (ESPN)
