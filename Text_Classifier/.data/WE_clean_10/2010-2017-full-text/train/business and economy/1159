Business Matters, Decoding the Japanese toilet
Any foreigner who has travelled in Japan or the region has probably encountered the Japanese 'smart' toilet, which has an electronic console of buttons attached that seems more fit for gaming than relief. The combination of symbols can be completely baffling for anyone without Japanese and unused to such hi-tech facilities. Now the manufacturers in Japan, the Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association, have decided to standardise the symbols to avoid confusing tourists. There should now be no mistaking big flush, small flush, lid raise, seat raise, fan, rear spray, front spray and stop. So will it work? The BBC's Roger hearing asked that to Kelsey Leuzinger, who taught English in Japan for two years, but is now back in Memphis, in the US.
