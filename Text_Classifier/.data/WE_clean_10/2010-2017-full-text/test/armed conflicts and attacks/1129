Mubarak resigns - Friday 11 February
Tahrir Square is still full of celebrating people, just after midnight in the Egyptian capital. Time to wrap up this live blog – and thanks to everyone around the world who has read and contributed to it, whether by phone, Twitter, email and any other form of media.
Jack Shenker in Cairo sends over this video of tonight's celebrations:
• President Hosni Mubarak has resigned and handed over power to the army
• Egypt's protests erupted in celebration as news spread that Mubarak had left Cairo
• The military command issued a statement promising a transition to democracy and to respect the will of the people
• Reports say the military has sacked the cabinet and suspended parliament
• Obama said the US will continue to be a friend and partner of Egypt, and that the events in Tahrir Square were an inspiration to the world
• Swiss authorities issue a pre-emptive freezing of any financial assets held by the Mubarak family in the country
Hats off to the Guardian's journalists on the ground: Jack Shenker, Peter Beaumont, Harriet Sherwood, Sean Smith and Chris McGreal.
One final tweet: from Peter Beaumont, who was there in Cairo at the start but heard the news today while in a Morrisons supermarket carpark.
Algeria is another country with a nervous government, ahead of a day of protest planned for Saturday. The government and security forces are leaving nothing to chance according to this AFP report from Algiers via Google:
Meanwhile, an unemployed man who had set himself on fire in the town of El Oued, in the far east of Algeria, died today, bringing to four the number of suicides by self-immolation in the last month, apparently inspired by events in neigbouring Tunisia.
After the overthrow of regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, how are the region's other governments reacting? The Guardian's Julian Borger tweets some fascinating news from Bahrain:
Well that's one way of doing it.
Michael Bimmler, a Swiss student at Oxford, emails more details about the Swiss authorities freezing the assets of the Mubarak clan and allies:
More details here [pdf, in French] and the individuals named:
Hosni Mubarak Suzanne Thabet, wife of Hosni Mubarak Alaa Mubarak, son of Hosni Mubarak Heidi Rasekh, wife of Alaa Mubarak Gamal Mubarak, son of Hosni Mubarak Chadiga el Gammal, wife of Gamal Mubarak Mounir Thabet, brother of Suzanne Thabet Ahmed Alaa El Din Amin El-Maghrabi, former minister Mohamed Zoheir Mohamed Wahid Garana, former minister Habib Ibrahim El Adli, former minister Ahmed Ezz, former head of the NDP Rachid Mohamed Rachid, former minister
The White House has just posted video of Obama's statement on Egypt online – it's one of his better speeches.
Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official told Reuters: "It's too early to foresee how [Mubarak's resignation] will affect things. We hope that the change to democracy in Egypt will happen without violence and that the peace accord will remain."
It turns out that Mubarak's fall is George Bush's fault – but not in the way you'd think. Salon reports:
Out of Kefaya grew the April 6 youth movement, and the rest is history.
Gibbs says Obama has not made any calls to heads of state in the region today in the wake of Mubarak's resignation. The spokesman also said that Obama had not spoken with Mubarak.
Gibbs also said Iran's government should allow its people to demonstrate and assemble peacefully, but instead was cracking down on opposition leaders and blocking international media in the wake of events in Egypt.
Now Obama pops up in the White House press briefing room, because it's the last day for his longtime spokesman Robert Gibbs. Obama begins by deadpanning:
NBC's Richard Engel, who has done a brilliant job reporting from Egypt, gets the reaction to Obama's words live from Tahrir Square, where he is mobbed by young men chanting Obama's name and "We love America!"
Obama's words are being carried live on Egyptian state television, with Obama saying the events there carried "echoes from Germans tearing down a wall," before quoting Martin Luther King:
"Over the last few weeks the wheel of history has turned at a blinding pace," says Obama, in a brief but powerful statement.
The US president began by praising the armed forces's role but calling for reform to continue:
Obama listed lifting Egypt's emergency laws, revising the constitution and enacting other safeguards to "make this change irreversible" and set the path for free and fair elections. He continued:
And then with a nod to Martin Luther King:
Al Arabiya television is reporting that the Egyptian military will announce the dismissal of the cabinet, the suspension of the upper and lower houses of parliament, and that the head of the constitutional court will form an interim administration with the military council.
Al Arabiya is also reporting that Amr Moussa will step down as secretary general of the Arab League within the next few weeks – and he is talked of as a leading contender in the up-coming presidential elections.
President Obama is due to make a statement on Egypt from the White House's Grand Foyer – reserved for set piece presidential apperances – in 15 minutes or so.
Hosni Mubarak spent his last hours in office bitterly denouncing the US, according to a phone call he held with an Israeli politician.
Reuters reports that former Labour cabinet minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had a 20-minute conversation yesterday with Mubarak: "He had very tough things to say about the United States," Ben-Eliezer told Israeli TV.
More reaction from Gaza, with Sami Abu Zuhri, the Hamas spokesman, issuing a statement tonight, saying Hamas was standing beside Egypt's "revolution victory" and backing its demands.
It criticised the Mubarak regime for its assistance in imposing a blockade on Gaza, adding:
The Swiss government has frozen any assets belonging to Hosni Mubarak or family in Switzerland. The Foreign Ministry gave no details on what assets the Mubaraks hold in Switzerland, saying it "wants to avoid any risk of misappropriation of state-owned Egyptian assets".
The Guardian's Jack Shenker shares the atmosphere in Tahrir Square right now:
Egyptian state TV has bowed to the inevitable and is just showing al-Jazeera's feed. A week ago the government banned the channel from operating. Now this.
Meanwhile, this website is doing the rounds for those wondering if Mubarak is still president, thanks to ismubarakstillpresident.com.
Wael Ghonim seems to be reassured by the military statement reported below.
The armed forces statement said: "We know the extent of the gravity and seriousness of this issue and the demands of the people to initiate radical changes. The higher military council is studying this issue to achieve the hopes of our great people."
In this audio you can hear the emotion in the voice of veteran activist Ahmed Salah, as he shared what today means to him:
More on vice president Joe Biden's remarks on Egypt today:
On Fox News though they have a different view. One presenter said it was the biggest event since "victory in Iraq".
Carl Bernstein – the Watergate guy – says it's on the scale of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The White House now says that Obama's statement will take place at 3pm ET / 8pm GMT / 10pm EET.
A spokesman for Egypt's military has just appeared on television to read a new statement, "Communique Number Three".
Read aloud in a flat monotone, the statement said that the supreme council of the armed forces was "currently studying the situation to achieve the hopes of our great people" and will issue further statements to clarify its position:
The military also had a farewell message for Mubarak:
And it had kind words for the protesters:
Note that the army's statement made no mention of vice president Suleiman – interesting in the context of the Ahram Online report mentioned below. Further analysis of what this all means when we get the full text.
The New York Times's Lede blog alerts us to an intriguing report from Ahram Online, the English-language arm of the state newspaper Al Ahram, that "both of last night's addresses by Mubarak and Suleiman were in defiance of the armed forces":
El-Zayat said that represented a deep cleavage between the armed forces and the presidential authority of both Mubarak and Omar Suleiman.
My colleague Hazem Balousha sends this from Gaza City:
The White House has announced that Barack Obama's statement on Egypt, scheduled for 1.30pm ET (6.30pm GMT), has been delayed, and the venue has been switched from the press briefing room to the Grand Foyer as the administration prepares to ramp up Obama's response.
This is Richard Adams in Washington DC taking over live blogging duties.
Here's avideo of the full statement from the vice president Omar Suleiman.

It's fair to say he doesn't look very happy.
It can't be very often that Amnesty International is joining in the celebrations of an army taking power but this has not been an ordinary day. Secretary General Salil Shetty said:
Ian Black, the Guardian's Middle East editor has been analysing what comes next.
On the implications for the wider Middle East:
On the implications for the US:
Joe Biden, the US vice president, who initially defended Mubarak, saying he was not a dictator and should not stand down, said: "This is a pivotal moment in history... the transition that's taking place must be an irreversible change"
There has been reaction from other leaders.
The British prime minister David Cameron called for a move to "a move to civilian and democratic rule" . He said the departure of Mubarak offered Egypt a "really precious moment of opportunity". Speaking on the steps of No 10, he said the new government should start to put in place "the building blocks of a truly open, free and democratic society".
German chancellor Angela Merkel, said: "Today is a day of great joy. We are all witness to historic change. I share the joy of people on the streets of Egypt."
The Nobel peace prize winner and Egyptian opposition figure Mohamed El Baradei has been talking to Al Jazeera in the last half and hour.
"This is the emancipation of Egypt. This is the liberation of the Egyptian people," he said in a phone interview with the broadcaster's English-language news channel. "It's a dream come true," said El Baradei, who added that it was the Egyptian people who had been able to restore their "humanity and independence.
Asked what happens next, he replied: "What I have been talking about and proposing is a transition period of one year. We would have a provisional council, a transition government, preferably a provisional council including a person from the army and civilians, but the main idea would be that the army and the people would work together for a year up to the point where we could have a free and fair election."
He said his message to the Egyptian people was: "You have gained your liberty, you have gained the right to catch up with the rest of the world. Make the best use of it you can and God bless you."
There has s been a jubilant response in Lebanon and Tunisia, the Associated Press reports:
Amr Mousa, an Egyptian, and the secretary general of the Arab League, who has previously hinted that might stand for presidency, has given his reaction:
Our political correspondent Allegra Stratton says the UK has already been considering the prospect of an asylum application from Mubarak:
In what has turned out to be a momentous day, here is a summary of events.
President Hosni Mubarak has resigned and handed over power to the army. His vice president, Omar Suleiman, said in a short TV address: "In these difficult circumstances that the country is passing through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave the position of the presidency. He has commissioned the armed forces council to direct the issues of the state."
Protests turned to celebrations around Egypt. "Cairo erupts in celebration as 18 days of defiant protest finally delivers a revolution after 24 hours of euphoria, dashed hopes and victory," our correspondent Chris McGreal wrote from outside the state TV centre. "There was a complete eruption of humanity, I have never seen anything like it. The world's biggest street party has really kicked off here," said Jack Shenker from outside the presidential palace.
But there are still questions over what happens next. The army is now in charge and it has yet to make its intentions clear.
Our correspondent Chris McGreal was outside the Egyptian state TV building when the historic announcement was made. In this audio report, he says:
But Chris warns there will now be close scrutiny of the army:
There are reports that the Egyptian army is to make another statement soon.
Nicholas Kristof, the New York Times Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, has been quick to instill a note of caution:
Harriet also contemplates how the downfall of Mubarak will play in Israel, his great ally:
Harriet Sherwood reports from Israel on the reaction to Mubarak's demise from Hamas:
Here's some reaction from Qatar, from Reuters:
Mubarak picked an auspicious date to resign. On this day 32 years ago the Iranian revolution took place when the Shah's forces were overwhelmed. And 21 years ago today Nelson Mandela was freed by the apartheid regime in South Africa.
Wael Ghonim, Google's head of marketing in the Middle East, annointed by some as the voice of the revolution after his emotional speech on his release from prison, tweeted simply: "Welcome back Egypt".
Reaction has started to come in from the US and the EU.
Tariq Ali has written a piece for Comment is free. He says:
Barack Obama, who appeared humiliated last night when Mubarak gave that infamously equivocal statement, is to speak at the White House at 6.30pm GMT.
The Guardian's Twitter map of Middle East protests is being overrun with outpourings of emotion from Egypt at the moment. It's a great visual representation of the reactions in the country.
Says @Port_Sa3eedy: "Someone slap me... I can't believe.... I'm tearing down #egypt #mubarak "
From amidst a cacophony of cheers, our correspondent Jack Shenker describes the reaction of the crowd outside the presidential palace.
Egyptian state TV is showing live pictures of the celebrtions in Tahrir square. "The newsreader is smiling and looks as happy as many of the people down there on the square," says the anchor on al-Jazeera English.
The Egyptian pro-democracy campaigner Mohamed ElBaradei has cheered Mubarak's resignation. "This is the greatest day of my life. The country has been liberated after decades of repression," he told The Associated Press. He said he expects a "beautiful" transition of power.
Our correspondent Chris McGreal in Tahrir Square writes: "Cairo erupts in celebration as 18 days of defiant protest finally delivers a revolution after 24 hours of euphoria, dashed hopes and victory."
We have now embedded a live video stream from Tahrir Square. You can watch it by refreshing this page.
The full text of the vice-president's very brief statement:
There are huge cheers in Tahrir Square.
President Mubarak has gone and the army has been entrusted with the republic, it has just been announced.
Omar Suleiman is making a statement now. "President Hosni Mubarak has decided to waive the office of the republic."
My colleague Harriet Sherwood sends this from Jerusalem:
Here is an interactive map of the Guardian's Twitter network of Arab protests.
Our correspondent Martin Chulov, who is monitoring events from Amman, says Egyptian state TV is now interviewing protesters. "This time, he must be gone," Martin says.
We are awaiting a "statement from the presidency" - not, interestingly, from the president. In the meantime Hossam Badrawi, secretary general of the ruling NDP, has announced he has quit the party in an interview on Hayah TV, according to multiple sources. Yesterday he had been prominent among those who were predicting that Mubarak was about to stand aside.
"It's a resignation from the position and from the party," Badrawi told al-Hayat TV. "The formation of new parties in a new manner that reflects new thinking is better for society now at this stage."
Al-Arabiya TV is now reporting that police killed 5 people in the clashes in el-Arish (see 3.32pm).
There are reports of clashes in the north Sinai town of el-Arish. Al-Jazeera says at least one person died and 20 were injured when people with small firearms attacked a police station. From Reuters:
My colleague Richard Adams in Washington sends the following:
On the Arabist blog, Issandr El Amrani has posted his instant thoughts on the situation as he sees it. It's worth a read. Amrani believes it is "pretty evident that Suleiman is in charge". He asks why the regime, including the army, still need Mubarak to be nominally in charge. He says:
There are reports that president Hosni Mubarak has left Cairo. Helicopters have been seen leaving the presidential palace in Cairo, and a local government official has said he is in the red sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
After Mubarak's speech last night, it appeared he had defied the people's call for him to step aside. But today, Egyptian diplomats are briefing that he has indeed relinquished power to his deputy, Omar Suleiman. The army also stated that a handover of power had begun.
The New York Times is portraying this as a significant moment in the protests. It says diplomats are trying to confirm that Mubarak's speech last night "signalled his irrevocable handover of presidential authority":
