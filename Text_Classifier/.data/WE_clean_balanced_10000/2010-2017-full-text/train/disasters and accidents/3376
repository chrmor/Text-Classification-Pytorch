Speaking to The Express Tribune, intelligence and BDS officials also confirmed that the blast occurred when explosives being moved for a terrorist activity exploded.
The blast, which could be heard in far off areas of Multan, was strong in intensity, thus damaging scores of shops and buses in the area. It also engulfed a number of vehicles in fire following the explosion.
The deceased and injured were shifted to the Nishtar hospital, and other nearby facilities. Officials at the Nishtar Hospital said five bodies and 63 injured were brought to their facility.
