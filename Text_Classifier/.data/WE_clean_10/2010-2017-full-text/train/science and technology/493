China set to launch Tiangong-2 space lab
China is set to launch a second space lab into orbit Thursday, a crucial step in Beijing's ambition to have a permanent space presence.
A Long March 2F rocket is expected to blast off at 10.04 p.m. local time (10:04 a.m. ET) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert carrying the lab, known as Tiangong 2 or "Heavenly Palace," state media reported.
The new lab is able to host astronauts for much longer than its predecessor, the Tiangong 1, which was launched in 2011. It has two cabins -- one for astronauts and experiments, the other for equipment.
Shenzhou-11 spacecraft holding a two-man crew is expected to launch If Thursday's launch is successful, next month the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft holding a two-man crew is expected to launch in mid to late October -- China's first manned mission since 2013.
It will dock with the space lab and the two astronauts will spend 30 days there carrying out experiments -- making it China's longest mission yet.
The Tiangong-2, and its predecessor Tiangong-1, are prototypes for China's ultimate goal -- a permanent 20-ton space station, which is expected to launch after 2020. "Tiangong is a precursor testbed of capabilities, building toward the large space station has always been the culminating goal of the Shenzhou program," said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the Naval War College specializing in space programs and space security. Shenzhou-10 was China's fifth manned space mission. The Shenzhou-10 spaceship, propelled by a Long March-2F rocket, blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on June 11, 2013. The crew for this mission included a woman, Wang Yaping, and two male astronauts, Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang. Nie, Zhang and Wang discuss technical issues during training in April 2012, a year before the 15-day mission. The astronauts had to undergo a series of tests in their pressure suits prior to the mission. Wang undergoes a cardiovascular endurance test a few weeks before the mission. Zhang practices entering the return capsule on May 31, 2013. Zhang, left, Nie, center, and Wang, right, during a training session in the return capsule.

The Shenzhou-10 spacecraft is transferred to the launch site at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the day of the launch. Hours before launch, the Shenzhou-10 spaceship arrives at the launch site. After the 15-day mission, the Shenzhou-10's return capsule landed successfully in Inner Mongolia on June 26, 2013. After emerging from the return capsule, the astronauts wave to people on the ground. China's space station is expected to be sent into orbit just as the US-led International Space Station goes out of service -- making China potentially the only country with a permanent space presence. European astronauts are said to already be learning Chinese in anticipation. Since 2011, US Congress has barred NASA from contact with China's space program because of national security fears. "Chinese politicians certainly have wanted to work with the United States in space, to show they are an accepted part of the international family of spacefaring nations, but with their own space station forthcoming and international partners other than the US willing and lining up to work with them, that imperative decreases," said Johnson-Freese.
