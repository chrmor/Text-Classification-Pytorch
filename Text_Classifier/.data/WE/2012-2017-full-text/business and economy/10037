European Central Bank Breaks New Ground to Press Growth
 In addition, the central bank said it was moving closer to making purchases of packages of business loans, another way of funneling credit to companies in troubled countries like Greece that desperately need it.
The negative interest rate, which the central bank will impose beginning June 11, is meant to encourage banks to put their money to work to rebuild the battered euro zone. It is also aimed at weakening the euro, by making exports more competitive.
The markets welcomed the measures. European stocks rose broadly, with the German DAX index reaching a record high.
But it is unclear whether such efforts will have the desired long-term effects. The negative interest rate has never been tried on such a large scale, so its real-world effects are hard to predict.
And many economists wonder whether the central bank is doing enough, given the current economic picture. The central bank stopped short of using its metaphorical bazooka, the large-scale purchases of bonds and other financial assets known as quantitative easing.
“The conventional measures are all done,” said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “What remains is quantitative easing.”
But quantitative easing is a tricky proposition in Europe. The bank would have to make the politically delicate decision of what assets to buy from among the euro zone’s 18 members. The Federal Reserve in the United States had much more power to pursue its bond buying several years ago in a program that it is only now winding down.
