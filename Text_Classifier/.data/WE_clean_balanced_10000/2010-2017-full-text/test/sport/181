Rugby World Cup 2011: Richie McCaw driven by past failures
After a long week of media commitment, McCaw was curt as he addressed the press before their match against Tonga at Eden Park. “I think we are just ready to go, it’s been a long time coming. History has shown that what’s happened previously, good or bad, means nothing come [World Cup]) kick-off.
“There is a wee bit of motivation because I have been involved in two previous Cups where we haven’t achieved what we were after, so to get another shot I suppose, it sits in the back of your mind. You’d be a mug if you hadn’t learned in the years since.”
New Zealand’s only World Cup triumph came in 1987 and, assessing the challenge of being favourites, McCaw said: “It is a stage where everyone is at their peak, and you have got to be if you want success. That is what motivates me – to test yourself in the toughest environment. And, when you do that and succeed, that is when you can be satisfied.”
Assistant coach Wayne Smith also backed the squad to go all the way this time.
“We have a great group of men who have handled quite a bit of adversity since that last tournament and have fronted up and come through and put a really good record together.
“Proof of the pudding will be rising to this occasion and that’s what we’ll try to do.”
Although Tonga are rank outsiders to threaten an All Blacks team containing the likes of McCaw, Dan Carter, Sonny Bill Williams and Israel Dagg, Smith said they knew there was a job to be done.
“There is no complacency in this group,” he said. “We are very aware of what they [Tonga] pose. They have got some of the biggest runners in world rugby.
“You don’t want a soft pool, and we haven’t got one. I think they will test us physically and they will test us with their athleticism. They are all good rugby players.”
Worcester hooker Aleki Lutui, the most experienced player in Tonga’s squad after making his Test debut 12 years ago, said the game would be won or lost up front.
“We are going to front them up because in most games we are going to be relying on our forwards. That’s a big part of our game,” he said.
“Our strength is our forwards. It’s a big role for us, and physicality is going to be right up there.”
The Tongan pack has a strong link to the All Blacks with their scrum coach, Dan Cron, being the son of New Zealand’s scrum coach Mike Cron. .
