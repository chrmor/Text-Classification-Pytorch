Ariana Grande Had a White House Performance Turned Down After Donut-Licking Incident
On Friday (July 22), Wikileaks published thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including one email thread revealing Ariana Grande had a proposed White House performance rejected over her donut-licking scandal last year.

The leaked emails show a request to vet Grande with interest in booking her for a White House gala late last year. While Grande seems to have a clean criminal and financial record, as Gawker reports, the vetting includes a detailed report of the controversy in which Grande was caught on camera at a donut shop, where she "maliciously" licked some unsupervised pastries.
Upon reviewing the proposed performance, White House employee Bobby Schmuck replied: "Nope, sorry."
Grande soon, and repeatedly, apologized for the incident. Since then, she's released her third album, Dangerous Woman, which produced the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit "Dangerous Woman" and the still-rising single "Into You."
Billboard hailed Dangerous Woman as one of the best albums of 2016 so far.
