MANILA â€“ Classes and work in government offices in Zamboanga City were suspended Tuesday due to continuous rains and severe flooding.
Zamboanga City Mayor Maria Isabelle Climaco-Salazar said the class suspension covers all levels in both public and private schools.
Government work was also suspended, except in agencies involved in front line services.
Floods triggered by strong rains that started over the weekend have displaced hundreds of families in the city, including those in areas affected by the armed conflict involving Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters under the Nur Misuari faction.
