Kenyan ambassadors summoned over Omar al-Bashir's visit
Kenyan ambassadors in Europe have been asked to explain why Kenya did not arrest the Sudanese president during a recent visit to Nairobi.
There is an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for President Omar al-Bashir on genocide charges.
President Bashir was in Kenya last week for a ceremony marking the adoption of a new constitution.
The ambassadors were summoned to foreign ministries in a number of European countries.
Kenya is a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is obligated by its warrants.
"They emphasized that the UK expects the government of Kenya to stand by its obligations under the Rome Statute, and as a UN member state," a statement from the British High Commission in Nairobi said.
The ICC has reported Kenya to the UN Security Council over the visit.
In July the African Union instructed its members - which include Kenya - not to apprehend Mr Bashir.
Kenya is not the first ICC signatory to choose not to arrest Mr Bashir. Earlier this year he travelled to Sudan's neighbour Chad, which took no action and said the visit had helped to improve bilateral ties.
