Deutsche Bank employees indicted over stock manipulation
SEOUL, Aug. 21 (Yonhap) -- Four employees of Deutsche Bank AG and its South Korean brokerage unit have been indicted on charges of making massive profits from illegal stock market trading last year, prosecution officials said Sunday. Three foreign employees, including a ranking official at the German bank's Hong Kong office, and one South Korea employee at Deutsche Securities Korea, are accused of pocketing 44.8 billion won (US$41.3 million) through the alleged market manipulation that triggered a sharp 2.7-percent plunge in the key local stock index KOSPI on Nov. 11. The South Korean brokerage unit was also indicted on the same charges.
