2 killed in windstorm; thousands without power
Two people were killed and thousands of homes and businesses lost power when high winds ripped through the Bay Area overnight, authorities said Friday.
The winds were particularly strong in the East Bay and North Bay, where numerous trees were knocked down. The National Weather Service reported a gust of 65 mph just north of Piedmont and said sustained winds topping 40 mph were common.
A man was killed in Oakland when a falling tree struck him on Austin Street near Fruitvale Avenue shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday, police said. About a half hour later, a motorist who appeared to be trying to avoid downed debris crashed on Skyline Boulevard in Oakland, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Neither man's name has been released.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. crews worked overnight to repair fallen power lines. At one point, 67,000 customers - 43,000 in the East Bay - were without electricity, said PG&E spokeswoman Jana Morris.
