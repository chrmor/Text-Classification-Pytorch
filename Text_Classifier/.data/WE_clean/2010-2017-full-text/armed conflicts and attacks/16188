Bahrain court jails 3 protesters: lawyer
Dubai: A Bahrain court on Monday jailed three protesters for up to 15 years on charges including attempting to kill a policeman and taking part in anti-government demonstrations, a lawyer said.
The main defendant was given 15 years for trying to kill the officer, as well as joining protests and taking part in violence in June 2012 in a village near the capital Manama, the lawyer said.
The second got 10 years, also for attempted murder and participating in protests and violence, while the third was jailed for five years, the lawyer said, requesting anonymity.
At least 80 people have been killed in Bahrain since February 2011, according to the International Federation for Human Rights, when opposition protests rocked the streets of Manama.
Despite a crackdown in March 2011, backed by Gulf troops, demonstrators were soon back on the street.
