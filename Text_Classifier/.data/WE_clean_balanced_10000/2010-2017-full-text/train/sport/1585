Anzhi Makhachkala will wrap up a deal for Shakhtar's Willian, according to manager Mircea Lucescu.
The Shakhtar boss confirmed that the release clause for the player, at €35m, had been met by the super-rich Dagestan outfit and the player would agree terms with the club.

Lucescu said: "This is his personal decision and we must respect that. Honestly, I tried to talk to him about the football. I think his decision is hasty and not right. Willian is like a son to me."
"Why did he not listen to me? Perhaps he had very strong pressure from his agent and friends who wanted to move at once. In the end, he could not resist."
The deal represents the biggest move of the window, although Russian clubs are not bound to the same transfer window as the rest of Europe. The deal is expected to therefore be wrapped up tomorrow, with the player signing a four-year deal.
