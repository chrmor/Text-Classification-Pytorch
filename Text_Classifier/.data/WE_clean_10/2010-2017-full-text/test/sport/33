"His brilliance is his weapon," trainer Bob Baffert said of Bayern after Kaleem Shah's 3-year-old Offlee Wild colt led every step from gate to wire to win the Breeders' Cup Classic. "You've got to flaunt your speed." Bayern certainly did, maintaining a lead of a length or more into the stretch as he took the field through a half in :46.44 and a mile in 1:34.16. Toast of New York, tenaciously running second throughout, was a game challenger in the final furlong and narrowed Bayern's margin to a nose at the finish. California Chrome was a neck back in third. The final time for the 1 1/4 mile race was 1:59.88. Three other 3-year-olds rounded out the top six, with 5-2 post-time favorite Shared Belief coming in fourth following a troubled start in which he was bumped after the winner veered sharply to the left. Following an inquiry, the stewards ruled that the incident did not affect the order of finish. The win was a first for Baffert in the Classic. "This has been so long in the making," said the trainer, who won his first Breeders' Cup race in 1992. Bayern's victory was also the first Classic win for rider Martin Garcia.
