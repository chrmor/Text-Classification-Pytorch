Arizona Freeway Shooting Suspect Leslie Allen Merritt Held on $1 Million Bond
A $1 million bond was set Saturday for a suspect in a string of highway shootings that has rattled Arizona drivers.
Leslie Allen Merritt, 21, is facing 28 felonies following his arrest Friday. He was charged with four counts each of drive-by shooting, intentional terrorism, discharging a firearm within city limits, aggravated assault, discharging a firearm, criminal damage and disorderly conduct.
"All I got to say is I’m the wrong guy, I’ve been telling the detectives that," Merritt said at his arraignment, adding that he has two children and can "never afford" such a high bond.
He was arrested by a SWAT team that tracked him to a Walmart in Glendale, Arizona — leading Gov. Doug Ducey to proclaim on Twitter: "We got him!"
"I think the detectives really worked this," Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves said on MSNBC on Saturday, crediting "old-fashioned police work" and public tips for helping the investigation to come together over the past few days.
On Friday, investigators had eyes on the suspect throughout the day, and also spotted him at a pawn shop selling a gun, reported NBC affiliate KPNX.
