Saudi king cancels Bahrain trip
TEHRAN - The King of Saudi Arabia on Wednesday canceled his trip to Bahrain for fear of facing an outrage from the Bahraini people, reports say.
According to ABNA, King Abdullah bin-Abdul Aziz has canceled his visit to Bahrain since its occupation forces are committing crimes in the tiny Persian Gulf country. The King was scheduled to meet Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa and the premier and crown prince of Bahrain, the Saudi electronic newspaper Elaph reported on Sunday, quoting informed sources. Hundreds of Bahrainis have been killed or injured by the Saudi and Bahraini military forces. The fate of many of them is not known yet. Since the beginning of the unrest, thousands of anti-government protesters have poured into the streets of Bahrain, calling for an end to al-Khalifa dynasty. On March 13, Saudi-led forces were dispatched to the country at Manama's “request” to quell countrywide protests. According to local sources, dozens of people have been killed and hundreds arrested so far during the heavy government clampdown on the peaceful demonstrations. Human rights groups say foreign and local forces have even raided hospitals and tortured doctors and patients as part of their efforts to suppress the protests and over 30 medical workers have gone missing. Amnesty International says it is concerned about the fate of missing activists and the fact that detained protesters are being tortured with impunity.
