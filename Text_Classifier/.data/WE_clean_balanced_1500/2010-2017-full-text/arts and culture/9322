Video: Catholic Church: 'contraception still forbidden'
The Pontiff has lifted the Church’s absolute ban on the use of condoms, but has restated the Catholic Church’s staunch objections to contraception.
He said it was acceptable to use a prophylactic when the sole intention was to “reduce the risk of infection” from Aids, arguing that using a condom to preserve life and avoid death could be a responsible act – even outside marriage.
