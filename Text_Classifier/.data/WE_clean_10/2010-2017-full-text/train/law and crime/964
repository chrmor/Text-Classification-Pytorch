An explosive believed to be a firebomb has been thrown into a car - allegedly while the driver was still sitting inside.
It is also believed that the victim alleged the suspect shouted 'There you go, Muslim', before throwing the device into the vehicle.
The car has been almost completely destroyed by the suspected bomb after it set on fire .
It has been reported that the incident took place in North Philadelphia this morning at approximately 5am.
The video was recorded by a witness, going under the username @FeministaJones, who said: "Heard a huge explosion. Didn't know what it was. Then heard a man yelling saying his skin was burning.
"Heard him say he was in his car and someone drove by and threw something in it while he was in it.
"Then kept hearing loud pops so I went to the door. Neighbours were helping the man because his skin was burning. He lost some of it.
"Went to the corner and saw the whole car on fire. After firetrucks come, he talks to them and then talks to us.
"He describes a car pulling up and someone inside saying 'There you go, Muslim' before throwing something into his car.
"Most of us know him too because he is always on the block working on his car and other things. This is wild.
"So I don't know if what was said was true or not but he said that's what he told the firemen. His face, arm, hands, legs all burned."
It is believed the man has been rushed to hospital after the incident. Police have yet to comment.
