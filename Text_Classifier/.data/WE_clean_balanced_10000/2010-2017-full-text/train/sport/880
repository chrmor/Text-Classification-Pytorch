P.G.A. Championship Will Move from August to May in 2019
“The landscape of golf is changing and it’s changing because of the Olympics,” he said. “We think that this is in the best interests of the P.G.A. of America and the P.G.A. Championship to make this move to position us for the next hundred years of the P.G.A. Championship.
He added, “We feel May is a far more powerful date for us to contest our major championship.”
The switch to May will ripple through the global golf calendar, not least reshuffling the order in which the four men’s majors are held.
It will also allow for the Ryder Cup to be moved forward slightly from its traditional date in the first week of October, Bevacqua said.
Monahan announced that the Players Championship, the flagship event of the PGA Tour, would move from May to March. The event was moved from March to May in 2007.
The P.G.A. Championship has been held in August since 1972, except for last year, when it was played in July to accommodate golf’s return to the Olympics.
