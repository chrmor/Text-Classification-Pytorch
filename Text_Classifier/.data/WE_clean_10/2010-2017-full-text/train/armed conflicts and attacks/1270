Major military operation reported in southern Syrian city â€“ This Just In
A major military operation was underway Monday in the southern Syrian city of Daraa, a witness said.
As the witness spoke, the sound of gunfire could be heard in the background, along with people screaming, "Allahu Akbar" - meaning "God is great."
"There are around 3,000 soldiers in Daraa now. They are breaking into people's houses, firing randomly at houses," the witness said. "We were sleeping and not protesting."
CNN was unable to verify the account.
Anti-government protests that have taken hold in many parts of Syria began in Daraa last month after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti.
