At least 11 people killed in Papua New Guinea 'bloody tribal fight': reports
At least 11 people have been killed and many others injured in a fight between two warring tribes in a remote Papua New Guinea jungle, reports say.
PNG media reports said two children and a pregnant woman were among the dead after one group attacked the other with high-powered guns.
PNG Post-Courier newspaper said "many others" were injured.
Western Highlands police commander Superintendent Martin Lakari told local media authorities were struggling to stop the slaughter because it was such an isolated area, only accessible by helicopter.
"I'm bringing this bloody tribal fight to the attention of the general public because it is taking place in a very remote part of our country which is only accessible by helicopter and nothing is being done to stop the loss of innocent lives," he said.
"That is why law enforcing agencies have not done much and now the fighting has reached Western Highlands where the Kokowa primary school and health centre in the Ruti Ukuni Maiwa area of Baiyer district have been completely destroyed."
The Post-Courier newspaper said the Kukurin tribe retaliated after five of their members were killed in June, killing six from the Yapetalin tribe.
It was not clear what sparked the clashes but the Post-Courier said the tribes had been fighting for 30 years "with a huge male population wiped out and increased numbers of females in both tribes".
