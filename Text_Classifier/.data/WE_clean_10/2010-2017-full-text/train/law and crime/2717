Baltimore Police Complete Initial Inquiry Into Death of Freddie Gray
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore police on Thursday handed over to prosecutors the results of their much-anticipated initial investigation into the fatal injury suffered by a young man in their custody, including the discovery that a police van carrying the man made a previously undisclosed stop en route to a police station.
The new stop turned up on video taken from “a privately owned camera,” said the deputy police commissioner, Kevin Davis. He added that it was “previously unknown to us,” but he did not elaborate.
His statement suggested that no police officers told investigators about the stop. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a lethal injury to his neck while in police custody. Asked later if the commanders were saying that officers had lied or covered something up, a Police Department spokesman, Capt. J. Eric Kowalczyk, said, “It would be inappropriate for us to further comment.”
The handoff from police to prosecutors, in a city scarred by rioting, and still under curfew and patrolled by National Guard troops, opens a new phase in the case, and shifts the focus to the city’s new, relatively untested state’s attorney, Marilyn J. Mosby. Her office, which acknowledged receiving the findings, will decide whether it has enough evidence to prosecute any of the officers involved; if so, it will present its case to a grand jury and ask for an indictment. If any criminal charges are brought, they could be months away.
