Ban elected for second term as UN leader
THE 192-nation UN General Assembly has elected Ban Ki-moon for a second term as the global body's secretary general.
The assembly unanimously backed the former South Korean foreign minister by acclamation. His second five-year term will start on January 1 and run through 2016.
A smiling Mr Ban bowed to ambassadors and diplomats gathered at UN headquarters who backed the reappointment through applause without a vote.
Outspoken in faulting the leaders of Arab countries facing protests, but criticised himself by some human rights groups, Mr Ban, 67, has been certain to win reelection for several months.
He declared his candidacy two weeks ago and was given formal backing by the UN Security Council on Saturday.
With no challenger to force a contest, the 192-member General Assembly confirmed the new term by consensus.
Mr Ban has said climate change - a topic the United Nations struggled with during his first five years - is his top challenge. He has called the battle against global warming "the most important priority" for mankind.
The UN chief has also vowed to keep speaking up for the protesters taking on long-ruling leaders in the Arab world.
