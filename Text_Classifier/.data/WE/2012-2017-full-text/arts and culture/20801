What 'La La Land's' sweep means for the Oscar race; Meryl Streep's big speech and other memorable moments
Sunday night after the show, salvation came in the form of two self-serve vending machines parked just inside the foyer of the InStyle/Warner Bros. party, where glamorous guests lined up for the best and most welcome sight of the evening: Free flats.
Men and women with weary soles and party souls flocked to the annual bash, one of the first stops of the night for winners, execs, even a Kardashian or two. They were greeted by machines hosted by the footwear company Rollasole, partnering with L’Oreal, doling out pairs of rolled-up flats in three sizes and two colors -- black or gold -- at the push of a button. Each pair came with a free lipstick for touch-ups for those who hadn't already filled their purses with the free L'Oreal lip paints and eyeliners lining the ladies' room inside the Golden Globes ballroom.
