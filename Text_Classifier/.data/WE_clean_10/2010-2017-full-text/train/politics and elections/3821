Denis O'Brien 'paid minister to help secure Irish phone licence'
A tribunal report found that Mr O'Brien – best known as an activist investor in Independent News & Media – gained unfair advantage in negotiations for Ireland's second national mobile phone contract through his links to former communications minister Michael Lowry.
Justice Michael Moriarty found that Mr O'Brien paid Mr Lowry significant sums of money and that Mr Lowry gave "substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the [mobile] licence".
The action of former communications minister Mr Lowry amounted to a "cynical and venal abuse of office", reported the judge.
However, Mr O'Brien on Tuesday rejected the findings of the Moriarty Report calling them fundamentally flawed and ignored crucial evidence.
He said: "I wish to state in the most categoric terms once again that I never made any payment to Michael Lowry in his capacity as a government minister, as a public representative or as a private citizen. It has been evident that the final report would be designed to damage the reputations of many reputable people."
The investigation dates back to the late 1990s when Mr O'Brien set up mobile phone company Esat Digifone to bid for Ireland's second mobile phone licence. He beat five other applicants to win the licence. Five years later he sold the company to BT, making €317m (£275m).
Mr O'Brien now owns Digicel, one of the largest mobile phone companies in the Caribbean with 6m customers.
The Irish government has been investigating the relationship between Mr O'Brien and Mr Lowry for more than 12 years at a cost of more than €100m to the Irish taxpayer. Tuesday's report is not expected to lead to any further action.
