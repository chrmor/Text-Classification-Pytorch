Missouri Governor Warns of 'Historic and Dangerous' Floods
Mayor Don Smith, who went door to door with other volunteers to evacuate residents, said the tourist town of 800 "has just been demolished."
"It's devastating, and we are all so exhausted," Smith told the station.
Meanwhile, in Chester, Illinois, just over the state line from Perry County, Missouri, Menard Correctional Center began transferring prisoners to other facilities because of flooding behind the walls in lower-level cell houses and basements.
Authorities didn't say how many of the prison's 3,700 inmates were forced to move. Five people have been confirmed to have been killed statewide in Illinois.
The Mississippi River spilled over a levee in the Missouri town of West Alton, prompting the mayor to urge everyone in the town of 520 people to evacuate. Interstate 44 was closed near the central Missouri town of Rolla, and a section of Interstate 70 was shut down in southern Illinois.
In some parts of the MIssouri, rivers are expected to crest as high as they did during devastating flooding in 1993, which is known as the "great flood," Nixon said.
The National Weather Service predicted that the Mississippi River at Chester, Illinois, would crest at 49.7 feet Friday, matching the 1993 record, the governor's office said. The Mississippi at Thebes was expected to crest Saturday at a record-breaking 47.5 feet.
The Mississippi River is expected to reach nearly 15 feet above flood stage on Thursday at St. Louis, which would be the second-worst flood on record, behind only the devastating 1993 flood.
In the 1993 flood, about 50,000 homes were destroyed across nine states, and losses were estimated at $15 billion to $20 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Forty-seven people died.
"All of us remember the devastating impact of the Great Flood of 1993. and that's why we have been working proactively with our local and federal partners to prepare and respond," Nixon said.
