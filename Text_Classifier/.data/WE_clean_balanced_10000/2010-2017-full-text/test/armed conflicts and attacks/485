Car Bomb Kills 12 in Yemen, but Targeted Minister Escapes Harm
SANA, Yemen — A car bomb exploded Tuesday alongside a convoy of vehicles used by Yemen’s defense minister, killing seven bodyguards and five civilians in the heart of the capital, Sana, while the minister escaped unharmed, government and hospital officials said. The attack came one day after a top operative of Al Qaeda in Yemen was killed in what Yemeni officials called an American drone strike.
The episodes spoke to the continued turmoil in poverty-stricken Yemen, where the United States is seeking to eradicate militant cells held responsible for a number of conspiracies, including an attempt by an operative of Al Qaeda to detonate an underwear bomb on a flight bound for Detroit in December 2009.
The blast on Tuesday in downtown Sana tore through a thoroughfare between the cabinet office and the state radio building, shattering buildings and wrecking a vehicle carrying the seven bodyguards, seconds after the minister himself, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed, had passed by in another vehicle after a weekly cabinet meeting.
The Interior Ministry said other explosives were found nearby and defused. The blast wounded 15 people. State television reported that Ali al-Ansi, head of the National Security Agency, Yemen’s intelligence agency, was fired after the attack.
No group claimed responsibility in the hours immediately after the attack, which seemed similar to earlier bombings ascribed to Al Qaeda. Militants have struck at government targets in Yemen in retaliation for the government’s campaign against Qaeda cells.
The bombing on Tuesday was not the first attempt on General Ahmed’s life. Last year, he was the target of two assassination attempts in southern Yemen in less than a month, one in Abyan Province and the second in the port city of Aden. And in May, a man disguised as a soldier blew himself up amid a military parade rehearsal near the presidential palace in Sana, killing hundreds, just before General Ahmed had been expected to greet the troops.
