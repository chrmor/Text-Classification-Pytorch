Ottawa to introduce back-to-work legislation for Air Canada employees
Ottawa said Tuesday it would take the drastic step to introduce back-to-work legislation for Air Canada’s sales and service agents less than a day after they walked off the job.
The country’s largest carrier had appeared to be managing its first major strike in 13 years with minimal disruptions, with roughly 1,700 managers and other non-unionized workers filling in for the striking workers at airports across the country.
But Lisa Raitt, the federal Labour Minister, said she was concerned about the impact a protracted strike would have on the broader economy and the travelling public.
She served notice Tuesday, just 15 hours after the strike began, that she would introduce back-to-work legislation in Parliament after the customary 48-hour waiting period had expired.
“The question mark has always been what would be the government’s response to a national strike with respect to Air Canada,” Ms. Raitt said. “We gave the response today.”
The last time Air Canada faced a similar strike was in 1998, when its pilots, who are not easily replaceable, walked off the job, wreaking havoc on the airline’s operations.
The decision to intervene in the strike this time was also a clear shot across the bow for Air Canada and its other unions, who must also renegotiate their own labour pacts this year.
Ken Lewenza, national president of the Canadian Auto Workers, which represents the 3,800 striking Air Canada employees, expressed frustration with Ottawa’s decision.
“This action by the government is a clear interference with the right to free collective bargaining,” he said in a statement. “This is a deplorable model for labour relations for this country; it sets a dangerous precedent when the government can get involved in the collective bargaining of workers employed by a privately-owned, for profit-company.”
It is not the first time the Harper government has been quick to step into the midst of a labour dispute.
In 2009, the federal government had drafted back-to-work legislation in a similar battle between Canadian National Railway Co. and its locomotive engineers just 11 hours after their strike began. Before the bill could be presented to the House, however, the parties reached a settlement.
“As history will show, in the history of airlines, in the history of rail and the cases of port matters, where it’s going to effect the economy, the government, regardless of the stripe of it, is going to act,” Ms. Raitt said.
But Anil Verma, a professor of industrial relations at the University of Toronto, disagreed that intervening at Air Canada so quickly was necessary.
Unlike the ports or the railways, there is ample competition in the airline industry both domestically, with WestJet Airlines Ltd. and Porter Airlines, and abroad with any number of international carriers, he said. “Air Canada does not fit the category at all,” he said.
Mr. Verma said he was surprised by the move, and felt that the Tories were trying to establish a new precedent with their recently-won majority.
“In the last 10 years or so, with governments of every stripe in Western countries, like Canada, the U.S., or the U.K., the approach has been to not intervene unless it’s absolutely necessary, to let collective bargaining play out, especially in the private sector,” Mr. Verma said. He gave the Vale-Inco strike as an example, which went on for more than a year in Sudbury, Ont.
“This could be the beginning of a new thing,” Mr. Verma said.
Ms. Raitt said Ottawa’s preferred route would be for Air Canada and the CAW to work out their own deal. But the back-to-work legislation would act as a motivator, she said.
“There’s a lot of variables that could happen. But our intention is to introduce it as soon as we can. The parties should be at the table trying to get a deal,” she said.
Air Canada’s negotiations with the CAW broke off shortly before midnight Monday over concessions the airline’s management was seeking from the employees over their pensions.
The union presented a counter pension proposal to the airline in the afternoon. But hadn’t heard back by press time, a union official said.
Peter Fitzpatrick, Air Canada spokesman, said he would not comment on the government’s decision to intervene.
“While negotiations of this nature are inherently challenging, we would prefer that a negotiated contract to the benefit of both parties be achieved through the normal bargaining process and we’re ready to go back to the table at any time,” he said in an email.
Meanwhile, Air Canada’s service at airports across the country showed little disruption from the strike. Despite a large and vocal demonstration from picketers, there were few lineups and delays at Pearson International airport in Toronto by mid-morning Tuesday, in part because many customers checked in online ahead of their flights.
The airline also implemented emergency measures typically reserved for weather events such as winter blizzards, including the cancellation and consolidation of several flights, giving Air Canada the flexibility to deal with any delays and disruptions rather than see them ripple across its network.
