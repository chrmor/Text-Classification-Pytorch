India hangs Kashmiri man convicted of deadly 2001 attack on Parliament
Indian news channels are reporting that a Kashmiri man convicted in the 2001 attack on India's Parliament has been hanged.
State-run Doordarshan News said that Afzal Guru was executed early Saturday morning in New Delhi's Tihar prison. Phone calls to the prison and several Home Ministry officials went unanswered.
Afzal Guru has been on death row since being convicted by India's top court in 2002. A mercy petition sent to India's president, the last step in the judicial process, was rejected earlier this week.
Several rights groups including political groups in Indian Kashmir have said that Guru did not get a fair trial.
Six security troops and a gardener were killed in the December 2001 attack. All five men who launched the attack were killed.
