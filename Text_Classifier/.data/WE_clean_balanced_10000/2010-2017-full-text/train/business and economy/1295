Chinese Stocks Plunge 5.5%, Their Biggest Single-Day Drop in 3 Months
HONG KONG — Just when it looked as if a relative calm was returning to Chinese markets, stocks nose-dived again on Friday. The main Shanghai share index lost 5.5 percent.
Shares had been on the rebound in recent months, after a summer of turbulent trading set off by the Chinese government’s attempt to prop up the market and by the central bank’s surprise devaluation of the currency, the renminbi, in August.
From its recent low in late August, the main Shanghai index had risen 24 percent, to 3,635.55 points, as of Thursday.
In percentage terms, the plunge of nearly 200 points on Friday was the biggest single-day drop for Shanghai stocks in three months.
