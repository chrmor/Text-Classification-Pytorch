Defection of Syrian Envoy Is in Doubt
PARISâ€”Syria's ambassador to France announced her resignation on French television on Tuesday, but a subsequent denial by a person claiming to be the diplomat on Syrian state television raised doubts about her defection.
Ambassador Lamia Chakkour told French news channel France 24 that she had decided to step down to protest against Syrian authorities' violent response to the people demanding "more democracy and freedom."
