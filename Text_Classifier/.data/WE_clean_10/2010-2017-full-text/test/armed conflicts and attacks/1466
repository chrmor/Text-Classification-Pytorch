At least 78 killed in Syria bombings
At least 78 people were killed and scores injured in a series of bombings in Syria on Monday, state media reported.
AFP reported that the death toll was more than 120. The Associated Press put the figure at 80.
The attacks happened in the coastal cities of Tartus and Jableh, which are strongholds of President Bashar Assad. The Aamaq news agency, which is run by the Islamic State, said militants from the extremist group carried out the attacks.
The official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported that 45 people were killed in twin bombings at the main entrance of the bus station in Jableh and in another attack on a city neighborhood.
In a fourth bombing, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of Jableh National Hospital’s emergency department, SANA reported.
In Tartus, the news agency reported that 33 people were killed and 47 others wounded when a suicide bomber and a car bomber attacked a crowded bus station and another bomber blew himself up.
Russia said it was concerned by the explosions. "Naturally, growing tensions and such terrorist activities cannot but cause increased worries," said Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for President Vladimir Putin, according to the TASS news agency.
"It once again demonstrated how fragile the situation in Syria is and stresses the necessity to continue active steps towards peace process," he added.
Peace talks in the Swiss city of Geneva have failed to yield a breakthrough in ending the five-year-old civil war.
