Greece raises death toll to 8 from capsized boat
The Greek Coast Guard says one more body - that of a boy - has been found from the boat that capsized off the island of Lesvos, bringing the death toll in that tragedy to eight.
Rescue workers on Thursday are still searching for about 30 others still missing in the capsizing Wednesday. They saved 242 people from the boat. Lesvos has borne the brunt of Europes refugee crisis, with more than 300,000 reaching the island this year and the number of daily arrivals recently peaking at 7,500. [AP]
