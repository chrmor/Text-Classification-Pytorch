Turkey warns Israel against repeating flotilla mistake
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned Israel against repeating "the same mistake" ahead of the Gaza-bound flotilla scheduled to set sail next month.
In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Davutoglu added that "It is Israel's responsibility not to implement (a blockade) against Gaza. A fact-finding mission of the UN declared that this â€¦ is illegal."
The Turkish foreign minister further added: ''In the flotilla last year, people were killed 72 miles (116 kilometres) from the coast, so this was in international waters. The Mediterranean does not belong to any nation.''
The Turkish FM said that his government had urged the IHH not to sail last year. ''We can advise, we can say something, but we cannot stop'' the flotilla, he said. ''In a democratic society, we cannot stop them''.
Israel's Ambassador to Turkey Gabby Levy has asked the Turkish government to stop the flotilla scheduled to set sail in the second half of the month of May.
On Monday, US President Barack Obama spoke to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and expressed his hopethat Turkey and Israel will find opportunities to improve their relations in the interest of regional stability.
