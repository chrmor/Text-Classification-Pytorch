Zsa Zsa Gabor calls in priest for final rites
ZSA Zsa Gabor, the 93-year-old Hollywood star in hospital with complications from a broken hip, called a priest to her room today for final rites.
"Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has seen a priest and is not doing very well. She's in serious condition. She asked to see a priest and receive her last rites," publicist John Blanchette said.
Gabor "spent her 24th wedding anniversary (yesterday) (in hospital) after surgery to remove two blood clots," Mr Blanchette said.
Her ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, "is at at her side. It is a very difficult time for her family", the spokesman said.
The blood clot surgery yesterday came just two days after Gabor was released from a California hospital following complications from a bad fall July 17 when she broke her hip.
The Hungarian-born actress and former beauty queen's lengthy film career includes spots in a dozen films and television series, including John Huston's Moulin Rouge (1952) and the 1958 film noir Touch of Evil by Orson Welles. She lent her voice to several animated films and TV series.
But the platinum blonde is especially known for her flamboyant lifestyle, legal troubles, nine marriages and a propensity to call just about everyone "darling".
