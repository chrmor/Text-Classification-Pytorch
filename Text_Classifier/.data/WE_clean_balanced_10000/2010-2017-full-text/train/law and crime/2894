Trump's pick for Army secretary drops out
WASHINGTON -- President Trump's nominee to lead the Army abruptly withdrew his name from consideration late Friday night, citing his inability to get around strict Defense Department rules concerning his family businesses. Vincent Viola, founder of digital stock trading firm Virtu Financial and owner of the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers, had been working through the confirmation process to become Army secretary since mid-December. In a statement, Viola said he was "deeply honored" to be nominated for the post, but concluded that he would not be able to successfully navigate the confirmation process. "I appreciate the confidence President Trump showed in me," he said. "I offer my continued support for President Trump and his administration, and look forward to redoubling my efforts to support the Army and its veterans as private citizens." Sources familiar said Viola had been looking for ways to divest from his businesses -- including ownership of the hockey team -- to take the top civilian Army post. He had planned to transfer ownership to other family members but turn over operations responsibilities to the team's vice chairman, but that arrangement did not meet Pentagon requirements, according to sources. The surprise announcement leaves another hole in Trump's Pentagon leadership team. While Defense Secretary James Mattis was confirmed by the Senate just hours after Trump was inaugurated, dozens of other key civilian military posts remain vacant or manned by temporary appointees. Trump has nominated Heather Wilson to take over as Air Force secretary and Philip Bilden to become Navy secretary, but confirmation hearings have not been announced for either role. Currently, Robert Speer is serving as acting Army secretary, a step up from his previous post as assistant secretary for financial management at the service.
