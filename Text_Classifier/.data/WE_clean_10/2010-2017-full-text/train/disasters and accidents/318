Dubai Tower Burns a 2nd Time, and Flammable Cladding Is Again Under Scrutiny
A huge fire in Dubai raced up the sides of one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers on Friday, raining flaming debris on the streets below and causing a frantic nighttime evacuation by residents.
Firefighters put out the flames within a few hours, and no serious injuries were reported, but the blaze raised new questions about safety in the skyscraper-studded cities of the Persian Gulf.
Several skyscrapers in the United Arab Emirates, including Dubai, have caught fire in recent years, most notably a 63-story luxury hotel that was engulfed in flames on New Year’s Eve in 2015.
The building in which Friday’s fire occurred — known as the Torch Tower — had also caught fire in 2015, and parts of the building were still being renovated from the last blaze when the new one struck.
