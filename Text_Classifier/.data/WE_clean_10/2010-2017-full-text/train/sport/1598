Rapid Reaction: Pittsburgh Penguins 3, San Jose Sharks 1
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The Pittsburgh Penguins clinched the franchise's fourth Stanley Cup championship with a 3-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks in Game 6 Sunday at SAP Center.
How it happened: The Penguins' best players were at their best. Unlike Game 5 when the Penguins quickly trailed, Pittsburgh gained the lead on Brian Dumoulin's goal at 8:16 of the first period. The Sharks came out flying in the second period and were finally rewarded for their efforts when Logan Couture scored at 6:27 to tie the score at 1-1. Only 1:19 after the Sharks knotted it, Penguins defenseman Kris Letang completely took over and dominated a push in the offensive zone from start to finish and it resulted in his third goal of the postseason as Pittsburgh regained a 2-1 lead. An empty-netter by Patric Hornqvist in the third sealed the deal. It also helped that the Penguins were able to stay somewhat disciplined and allowed only two power plays for San Jose, which Pittsburgh killed off early in the third period to secure its one-goal lead. Sharks goalie Martin Jones gave his team every opportunity to win this game, but it was Pittsburgh rookie netminder Matt Murray, 22, who secured the victory.
What it means: It means a summer of parties and lifelong memories for the Penguins. The victory also cements Crosby's legacy as the best player in the world. For the Sharks, months of heartache and a lasting sense of disappointment.
