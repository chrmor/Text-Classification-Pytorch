Recap: Reds at Phillies Game 1  Live Blog
Roy Halladay threw a masterpiece, and he made it look easy. In his first career postseason start, Halladay threw the first playoff no-hitter since Don Larsen’s perfect game in 1956. Halladay cruised: 104 pitches, 79 strikes, and only three three-ball counts.
The Phillies needed a gem on a night when they needed to scratch four runs off shaky starter Edinson Volquez. The Phillies manufactured a run on a double and stolen base by Shane Victorino and a sacrifice fly in the first. Victorino’s two-run single capped a three-run second inning that started with a four-pitch walk to Carlos Ruiz and an infield single by Wilson Valdez. Halladay helped himself with an RBI single. The Reds bullpen then shut the Phillies down, but the Reds bats never challenged Halladay.
Halladay, who threw a perfect game on May 29th, became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1973 to throw two no-hitters in one season. Halladay allowed just one runner to reach base: right fielder Jay Bruce, who walked on a 3-2 pitch in the fifth inning.
Here’s a recap of the inning-by-inning coverage by David Waldstein, Tyler Kepner, and Mike Tanier.
