Oslo police release names of Norway bomb and massacre victims
NORWEGIAN police have begun releasing the names of those killed in last week's bomb blast and massacre at a youth camp, an announcement likely to bring new collective grief to an already reeling nation.
Police overnight named the first four of at least 76 people killed. Although only names, ages and hometowns were listed, it will likely bring another shock to friends and acquaintances who did not already know of their deaths.
The first release listed three who were killed in a bomb blast in Oslo's government quarter and one killed at the island youth camp.
They were Gunnar Linaker, 23, from Bardu in northern Norway, who was killed at the camp; and Oslo residents Tove Aashill Knutsen, 56; Hanna M. Orvik Endresen, 61; and Kai Hauge, 33.
Gunnar Linaker was on the phone to his father, speaking about something else when the shooting started.
"He said to me: 'Dad, dad, someone is shooting,' and then he hung up," Mr Linaker told Associated Press.
Mr Linaker said his Gunnar was "a calm, big teddy bear with lots of humour and lots of love."
Mr Linaker's daughter who was also at the Utoya Island camp survived the shooting.
Earlier on Tuesday, the national newspaper Dagbladet posted the names and photos of 16 people it said were killed in the attacks or missing.
The information, apparently received from friends or relatives, showed three victims who did not appear to be ethnic Norwegians - examples of the multiethnic Norway that the alleged bomber and gunman says he despised.
Anders Behring Breivik, the 32-year-old who has confessed to the massacre, is unaware of the impact of the attacks and asked his defence counsel how many people he had killed, his lawyer Geir Lippestad told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Lippestad said his client is likely insane.
Breivik has confessed to last week's bombing in the capital and a rampage at a Labour Party retreat for young people that left at least 76 people dead, but he has pleaded not guilty to the terrorism charges he faces, claiming he acted to save Europe from what he says is Muslim colonisation.
The attacks began with a bombing outside the building that houses the prime minister's office in Oslo. Then, Breivik opened fire on an island retreat for the youth wing of the Labour Party, leaving dozens dead and hundreds of terrified young people scrambling to escape, many diving into the water to try to swim away.
