Babbel sacked as a Hoffenheim coach
Hoffenheim sporting director Andreas Muller has confirmed the departure of coach Markus Babbel The German side currently sit 16th in the Bundesliga with only 12 points from 15 matches, and the boss believes that a change is necessary in order to escape the relegation zone."Our increasingly threatening situation and the negative trend have left me no choice," the 49-year-old explained to reporters at a press conference."It is important to make a cut," he continued. "We have to hit the reset switch and start a new beginning."Under-23 boss Frank Kramer, who will initially take over the coaching role for the next two matches, is seemingly not happy about his assignment but said he is ready to take up the challenge."Of course, having to step [up] was not my desire," he said. "But I will confidently face this upcoming, difficult challenge."And Muller is adamant that the decision to name Kramer as an interim coach was the right choice."He will initially take over for the next two matches, but possibly even beyond that," Hoffenheim's sporting director said. "In this constellation we will have the necessary calmness to think about our next steps," he added.
