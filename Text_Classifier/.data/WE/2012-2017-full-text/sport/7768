Hawthorn avenge last year's Grand Final loss
Hawthorn beat Fremantle in the Australian Football League (AFL) Grand Final on Saturday, holding back a late surge from the Western Australians to secure their 11th premiership.
The Hawks, who narrowly lost to the Sydney Swans in last year's Grand Final, won 11.11 (77) to 8.14 (62) in front of some 100,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Hawthorn was ahead by 23 points at half-time but the Fremantle Dockers, playing in their first Grand Final in the club's history, fought back in the third quarter, narrowing the gap to just three points.
Fremantle wasted several opportunities throughout the match, and it wasn't until the second quarter that they kicked their first goal, with Tendai Mzungu taking the kick.
In contrast, Hawthorn's forward Jack Gunston kicked three of his team's five goals of the first half.
Hawthorn's defence also starred, with Brian Lake winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player on the ground for his performance in limiting Fremantle's Matthew Pavlich to just three goals.
Fremantle made their move in the third quarter, kicking five goals to narrow the scoreline but were down 10 points going into the final quarter and were ultimately unable to come back.
Hawthorn last won the title in 2008.
