Germany Just Got A $10 Million Bus That Seats 256
Getting around Dresden just got more interesting. The eastern German city is now home to the world's longest bus: A 101-foot behemoth with room for 256 passengers.
Developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Traffic and Infrastructure Systems, the AutoTram Extra Grand is the longest bus in the world, and costs a whopping $10 million.
The giant bus runs on a hybrid electric engine, Fraunhofen notes, "combining the best advantages of rail and road-bound transport systems." In electric mode, it can cover about five miles, and the batteries can be recharged while driving.
The AutoTram Extra Grand debuted on August 22 in Dresden, where it will enter trial service, the Daily Mail reported. To make the bus drivable in city traffic, Fraunhofer developed a computer driving system that keeps the vehicle's three carriages in line. Driving it will be no more complicated than operating a conventional bus, eliminating the potential need for additional driver training.
The result is a vehicle that closely resembles tramways being built in many European cities: high capacity, low emissions. But the bus wins in the cost department: Tramways require infrastructure that can cost between $35 million and $50 million per mile. The AutoTram will drive on existing roads. (Dresden has 12 tram routes and 28 bus routes.)
What the Dresden trial will reveal, Fraunhofer Director Matthias Klingner said, is "how such a long bus affects normal city traffic." While Germany does the testing, China is not waiting for the results: Beijing and Shanghai have already placed orders, according to the Daily Mail.
