Rudd backers emerge as Gillard fights
Four Labor ministers have backed a leadership comeback by Kevin Rudd, as Prime Minister Julia Gillard sought to bring an end to his campaign of "destabilisation" against the minority government.
Mr Rudd on Thursday announced his policy priorities while in Washington before getting on a plane back to Brisbane, ahead of formal confirmation he will contest the leadership at a caucus ballot called by Ms Gillard for 10am (AEDT) on Monday in Canberra's parliament house.
As she announced the vote she expects to win, the prime minister also promised to go to the backbench and never recontest the leadership if defeated, and called on Mr Rudd to pledge the same.
Ms Gillard told reporters in Adelaide her government had made "mistakes" over the past 18 months - Labor is languishing in the polls - but she was the best person to lead Labor to the 2013 federal election.
For the first time she elaborated on why she seized the job from Mr Rudd in June 2010, saying his government - in which she served as deputy leader - had suffered "paralysis" and lost voter support.
"It became absolutely clear to me that one of the overriding problems of the government that Kevin Rudd led is it was very, very focused on the next news cycle, on the next picture opportunity, rather than the long-term reforms for the nation's interests," Ms Gillard said.
