At the Fort Lauderdaleâ€“Hollywood International Airport, Spirit Airlines cancels eleven flights and delays 30 due to a dispute between the airline and its pilots (as talks occur between the airline and the pilots' union, Air Line Pilots Association, International). Protests break out and three travelers are arrested. (The New York Times)
