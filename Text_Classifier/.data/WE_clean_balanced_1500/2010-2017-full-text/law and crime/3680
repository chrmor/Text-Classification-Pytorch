Bulls star charged with murdering policeman 'with his hands'
South African rugby union player Bees Roux was charged with murder on Monday after allegedly beating a policeman to death in Pretoria.
At a bail hearing in a courtroom crowded with police officers, Roux's lawyer said his client would plead not guilty.
Roux, 28, claims his car was being stolen and that he was acting in self-defence, said the lawyer, who also claimed his client's credit card had been used at a fast-food restaurant after he was arrested.
There were so many colleagues of the slain police officer, Sergeant Ntshimane Mogale, 38, in court that some had to sit on the floor.
A murmur rose from the officers when it was suggested during the hearing that Roux saw himself as a victim.
