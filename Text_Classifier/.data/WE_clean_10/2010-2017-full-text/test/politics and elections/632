Bongbong Marcos jumps gun on INC
He spoke too soon.
On Friday, Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was quoted as saying that he has been endorsed by the politically influential Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a religious group with an estimated 1.6 million command votes.
He learned of the INC leadership’s decision last Tuesday, the senator was quoted by Radyo Inquirer as saying. His father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, also had the INC behind him, he said.
The Radyo Inquirer report was posted on the senator’s social media account.
But later in the day, Marcos retracted his statement when the INC did not officially confirm his claim.
According to the Marcos camp, the senator was misquoted when he made the statement during a sortie in Daet, Camarines Sur, on Friday.
According to his staff, what Marcos said was: “As far as I know there is no official statement from the INC so I cannot confirm. But I thank all those supporting me…Unfortunately on the specifics about the Iglesia ni Cristo they have not yet issued an official endorsement.”
INC spokesperson Edwil Zabala neither confirmed nor denied reports that the religious sect has already chosen to endorse presidential candidate Sen. Grace Poe and vice presidential candidate Marcos for the May 9 elections.
Zabala told reporters the group has yet to endorse a candidate and that they will make the announcement after meeting their members.
“As of now we have not officially endorsed any candidate. Our leaders may have chosen candidates for the INC members to support but we have not announced any names yet,” Zabala said in a phone interview.
