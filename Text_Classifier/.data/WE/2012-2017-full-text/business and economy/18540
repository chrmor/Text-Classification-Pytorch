Global Shares Drop as Traders Watch ‘Brexit’ Vote
HONG KONG — Britain’s voting to leave the European Union on Friday has sent markets, currency and other key pieces of the global economy on a wild ride.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 index is now down more than 7 percent after briefly recovering amid news that the vote to remain in the E.U. was gaining ground. The British pound fell from $1.50 to $1.36, an uprecedented drop in such a short period.
Earlier on Thursday, American markets had shrugged off concerns about the possibility of Britain’s leaving the E.U., but the early results were more positive for the “remain” side.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index has fallen about 4.7 percent, with stocks in British banks taking a particular beating: HSBC has dropped more than 8 percent, while Standard Chartered is down just more than 9 percent. The markets in Shanghai are down more than 1 percent.
