Five-mile wide suspected oil slick spotted just north of Deepwater Horizon explosion site
A suspected oil slick has been spotted around 20 miles north from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion.
Several people reported seeing a rainbow sheen on the surface of the water several miles long just off the coast of Louisiana, to the National Response Center.
Officials have confirmed there is a five-mile wide spill of some substance in the Gulf of Mexico, but have not yet identified it.
Casey Ranel, a spokesman for the Coast Guard said the agency sent out a cutter this morning to collect samples of the substance.
An airplane is also expected to fly over the area to give officials a better idea of what's in the water.
Pollution investigators and a helicopter crew are following up on two calls to the National Response Center - the federal point of contact for reporting oil and chemical spills - Paul Barnard, an operations controller for Coast Guard Sector, New Orleans, told the Times-Picavune.
Barnard said a pilot flying over the area reported seeing a sheen of around half a mile long by half a mile wide.Â 
But another caller estimated the area was around 100miles long.
'We haven't been able to verify that, and it would be very unlikely for an individual to be able to observe a 100-mile long sheen,' Barnard added.
Grand Isle Fire Chief, Aubrey Chiasson, told oilspillaction.com he was alerted to the substance by officials.
'They were doing some dredging at the mouth of the river, so it could be some silt or dredging material,' he said.
The BP oil rig exploded almost a year ago on April 20, killing 11 workers and injuring 16 others.
It caused 4.9million barrels of oil to gush into the Gulf of Mexico in what is now considered the second largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.
