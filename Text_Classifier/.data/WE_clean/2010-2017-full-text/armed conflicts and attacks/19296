Ukraine: Rebel attack kills 10 during shaky ceasefire
A rocket attack by pro-Russia rebels killed 10 civilians and injured 12 others in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said. It was the latest report of violence amid a shaky ceasefire in the region.
The rebels fired Russian-made Grad rockets near the village of Nyzhnya Krynka, where Ukrainian forces are positioned, the military said. The village is near the rebel-held city of Donetsk.
Nine civilian buildings were destroyed in the attack, according to the Ukrainian military.
