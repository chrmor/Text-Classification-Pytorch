Bodies of 4 Americans killed in Libya returned to U.S.
"Four Americans, four patriots, they loved their country and chose to serve it and serve it well," the president continued. "They had a mission and they believed in it, and they knew the danger and they accepted it. They didn't simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it, they embodied it: the courage, the hope and, yes, the idealism.
"I want people around the world to hear me. To those that would do us harm -- no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world. No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America."
