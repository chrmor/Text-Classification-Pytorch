U.S. and Europe Set to Toughen Russia Sanctions
The Europeans plan to impose similar capital-market restrictions on Russian state-owned banks as well as an embargo on future sales of arms and to restrict the sale of equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, according to officials briefed on the discussions. They are also considering limits on technology sales to Russia’s oil industry.
Under their own procedures, the Europeans cannot target individual Russian banks the way the Obama administration has, so the capital-market measures will affect all banks that are majority-owned by the Russian state. The Americans would then try to catch up by targeting more Russian banks. Although there would be some gaps between the two moves, officials said they would work to make sure Russia could not slip through them.
American officials were heartened by the agreement, saying it would frustrate efforts by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies. The key to the agreement, they said, was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who dropped her past reluctance and pressed for more assertive moves, which forced the French to go along, and that then forced the Italians to give in.
The new actions come as Russia’s economy is already under enormous pressure exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, with growth effectively stifled, capital fleeing the country, the ruble stressed and foreign investors increasingly shying away. Whether that will change Mr. Putin’s calculus, however, remained uncertain, and some American officials privately expressed doubt. Indeed, some worried that the escalation, along with Ukraine’s military success on the ground, might push Mr. Putin into a corner in a way that made him less willing to back down.
Moreover, the Europeans still refused to go as far as the Americans wanted. The arms embargo, for instance, will affect only future sales, and will not stop France from completing its delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers that has drawn criticism from Washington and elsewhere. Britain remained hesitant to cut off the entire Russian financial industry. And the Germans opposed measures affecting Russian natural gas, on which it relies for energy.
