Foxconn holds morale-boosting exercise in China
Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn held a morale-boosting, costumed "employee rally" on Wednesday, after a string of suicides at its Chinese factories turned a spotlight on working conditions.
Themed "Treasure your life, love your family, care for each other to build a wonderful future," the event took place at Foxconn facilities across China, the company said, with tens of thousands of employees turning out in costume.
At Foxconn's giant campus in the southern city of Shenzhen, booming music filled a stadium as thousands of workers -- dressed in everything from Spider-Man outfits to the Argentina football strip -- clapped and cheered.
A band played the traditional Chinese pipa, a four-stringed instrument, while yellow-clad acrobats danced and performed balancing tricks. Red banners saying "Care for and love each other" fluttered in the wind.
Employees from other factories across China were beamed in on a giant screen for the event, which followed the suicides of 13 workers this year at Foxconn.
"Foxconn feels it's perhaps time to look back and to learn from the tragedies and to send an important message to their employees that they are not alone, and that the Foxconn family is there to support them and to help them through their challenges," the company said in a statement.
