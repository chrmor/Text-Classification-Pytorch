8 Pakistan soldiers killed in attack near Afghan border
Security forces have been attacked repeatedly in the lawless tribal belt as well as in the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since a cease-fire declared by Pakistani militants expired in mid-April. The militant group known by its Urdu name, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, said it would not extend the truce unless the Pakistani government released 300 prisoners and met other conditions.
