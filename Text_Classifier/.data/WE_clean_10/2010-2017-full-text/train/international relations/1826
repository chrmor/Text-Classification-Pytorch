China, Japan and South Korea Pledge to Expand Trade at Joint Meeting
SEOUL, South Korea — Meeting for the first time in three years, leaders from China, Japan and South Korea agreed on Sunday that they would meet annually and work toward greater trade ties, even as they continued to wrangle over territorial and historical disputes.
Given their countries’ long history of mutual grievances rooted in a wartime past, the meeting of Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea was in itself considered progress.
“This summit meeting carries a historic significance because it restores a system of cooperation among the three countries, which in turn is an important frame of peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia,” Ms. Park said during a joint news conference with the two other leaders.
During their talks, held at Ms. Park’s presidential headquarters, the Blue House, the three appeared to have skirted their countries’ territorial and other thorny disputes, with their joint statement saying they would work for regional peace and stability “in the spirit of marching to the future while looking squarely at the history.”
