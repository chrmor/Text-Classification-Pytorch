Vic MP quits, by-election possible
Tens of thousands of Victorian voters may be forced to the polls before the November state election after a veteran government MP quit parliament, fuming about "betrayal".
Government lower house whip Craig Langdon cited family reasons for his resignation on Wednesday, but pointed to disloyalty in Labor ranks.
He lost Labor preselection for the seat of Ivanhoe in July to Banyule councillor, Anthony Carbines.
"Notwithstanding my family and personal reasons for resigning, it has become increasingly difficult for me to participate in parliament given a number of my colleagues undertook offensive acts of disloyalty and betrayal," Mr Langdon said in a statement.
"When government ministers and other MPs participate and propagate the demise of longstanding, loyal and dedicated members it can cause harm to the party and government.
"This becomes evident in the recent federal election."
