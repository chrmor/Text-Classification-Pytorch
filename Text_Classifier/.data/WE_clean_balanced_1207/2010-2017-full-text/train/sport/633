Andy Murray Propels Britain to Victory in the Davis Cup
GHENT, Belgium — Giant foam fingers. A remarkable variety of percussion instruments. Vuvuzelas. Disturbingly oversize photos of the home players on wooden sticks. Copious face paint. And at least one trombone.
There were many elements that differed from the typical tennis match here on Sunday at the Flanders Expo exhibition hall — a venue whose sporting history includes a semiregular regional dog show — but amid the unusual cacophony of noise and spectacle, there was, also, a singular familiarity: Andy Murray played. Andy Murray won.
It was, in many ways, that simple at this Davis Cup final, where Murray’s third victory in three days helped Britain win the most prestigious team competition in tennis for the first time in 79 years, beating Belgium, 3-1. On Friday, Murray beat Ruben Bemelmans in straight sets to even this best-of-five team match. On Saturday, he partnered with his brother, Jamie, to win in four sets. In the finale, he sealed the result by beating a game but overmatched David Goffin, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3.
Murray, the No. 2 player in the world, already held a special place in British tennis history for his victory at Wimbledon in 2013, the first British man to win the tournament since Fred Perry in 1936. Now, after helping end another drought that began that same year, he is at the center of his sport once again.
