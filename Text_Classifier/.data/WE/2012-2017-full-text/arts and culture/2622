Olympic torch visits EastEnders
The Olympic torch visited the fictional London borough of Walford when it appeared in a special live section of BBC soap EastEnders on Monday.
Viewers saw Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick, carry the torch past some of E20's most famous TV landmarks, including the Queen Vic pub.
Speaking ahead of the show, Fenwick said it was "quite terrifying".
Nineteen cameras were on Albert Square to capture the 31 regular cast members and 11 children involved.
The live insert during EastEnders saw Billy Mitchell cheered on by the residents of Walford.
With drama always high on the agenda, Billy's granddaughter Lola Pearce gave birth during the episode.
Fenwick admitted he was somewhat nervous about the performance, adding: "I just want to do it and make everyone proud".
The torch is scheduled to arrive at the Olympic Stadium in east London in time for the opening ceremony on Friday.
This not the first time the Olympics and EastEnders have crossed paths. In March, Royal Mail revealed that the Olympic Park was to be given the same E20 postcode as the soap's Walford home.
EastEnders viewers have already seen characters Fat Boy and Billy discover that they have been nominated as torchbearers.
In November 2011, regulars in The Queen Vic found out that the torch would pass through Walford and the following month Billy discovered he had been chosen to carry it.
The flame was seen in EastEnders on BBC One in an episode starting at 21:00 BST.
