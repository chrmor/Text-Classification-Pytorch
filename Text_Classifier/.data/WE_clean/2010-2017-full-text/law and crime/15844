Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus found in Cleveland – as it happened
The man credited with rescuing Amanda Berry has said she had a "little girl" with her when she escaped the house.
Charles Ramsey, who lives in a neighbouring property to where the women were found, told a local news channel that he heard a woman shouting.
"[I] heard screaming. I'm eating my McDonalds, I come outside, I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of her house, so I go on the porch and she says: 'Help me get out, I've been here a long time'."
"So I figured it was a domestic violence dispute," Ramsey said. He said he kicked the door of the house to free her.
"And she comes out with a little girl and she says: 'Call 911, my name is Amanda Berry," Ramsey said.
The video, from a local news channel, is below.
"When she told me it didn't register. Until I got to call 911. I thought: 'I'm calling 911 for Amanda Berry? I thought this girl was dead.' And then she gets on the phone and she says: 'Yes this is me'."
Ramsey said police then arrived and entered the property. "That girl Amanda told the police: 'I ain't just the only one. There's some more girls up in that house,'" Ramsey said.
"So they go up there 30 or 40 deep, and when they came out it was just astonishing," he said.
Ramsey said he had lived in the neighbourhood for a year and saw the neighbour in the house where the women were found "every day".
