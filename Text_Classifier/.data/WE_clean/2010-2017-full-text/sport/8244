Lochte beats Phelps with world record time in 200 IM
SHANGHAI -- Ryan Lochte continued to hold Michael Phelps at bay in an event Phelps used to own, the 200-meter individual medley, winning his second consecutive world title in the event and setting a world record of 1:54.00.
"I knew it was going to be a battle between Michael and I," said Lochte. "I got the better end this time...Anytime you break a world record you have to be excited."
Lochte is the first swimmer to set a long course world record in the post-rubberized suit era.
It was Lochte's second victory over Phelps this week. He also beat him in the 200-meter freestyle. Phelps finished in 1:54.16.
"That one frustrated me more than anything," said Phelps. "I thought I was going to get that one. I thought I was a little long at the finish and that cost me the race."
For several years, Phelps was the 200 IM king and Lochte was just another frustrated challenger to that throne.
While Phelps won the 200 IM titles at all world championships and Olympics held between 2003 and 2008, Lochte won two silver and two gold medals in the event.
But after the 2008 Olympics, the tables turned.
At the 2009 worlds, where Phelps did not compete in the 200 IM, Lochte won it in world-record time. Lochte also won at the 2010 national championships, with Phelps in the field.
At the Pan Pacific championships, the biggest international meet last season, Phelps conceded before racing even began, withdrawing from the 200 IM preliminaries to conserve energy for the medley relay scheduled for the same day.
In winning the 200 IM at Pan Pacs, Lochte nearly became the first swimmer to break a long-course world record in the post-rubberized suit era, coming within three-tenths of a second.
