Protesters, Police Clash in Baghdad
BAGHDAD—Police fired water cannons and rubber bullets Friday at protesters who scaled barriers to Baghdad’s heavily fortified International Zone, in the one of the largest demonstrations in the Iraqi capital in weeks.
Baghdad announced a curfew until further notice after 16 protesters were injured in clashes with security and 35 were admitted to hospitals with breathing problems, Iraq’s Interior Ministry said.
