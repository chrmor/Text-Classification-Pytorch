Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to clash in Las Vegas 'Fight Night' debate
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will square off for the third and final time in Las Vegas tonight for what has been dubbed "Fight Night".
After two vitriolic presidential debates, much of which were spent trading insults and discussing sexual assault allegations rather than policies, the third could top the lot as Mr Trump battles to make up lost ground on his rival.
It emerged last night that he had apparently invited President Barack Obama's half brother, Malik Obama, to the debate.
“I’m excited to be at the debate. Trump can make America great again,” Malik Obama told the New York Post.
He also backed Mr Trump over allegations from several women that the presidential candidate had sexually assaulted them in the past.
“I don’t believe them,” he said. “Why didn’t they come forward before?”
Mr Trump, who has denied all allegation of sexual assault, said: “I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik. He gets it far better than his brother.”
