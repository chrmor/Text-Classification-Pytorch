At 11pm SA time on Thursday, Anton Hammerl’s family received devastating news regarding his fate.
On 5 April 2011, Anton was shot by Muammar Gaddafi’s forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert. According to eyewitnesses, his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention.
The Hammerl family issued a statement in the early hours of Friday morning: “Words are simply not enough to describe the unbelievable trauma the Hammerl family is going through.
“From the moment Anton disappeared in Libya we have lived in hope as the Libyan officials assured us that they had Anton.
“It is intolerably cruel that Gaddafi loyalists have known Anton’s fate all along and chose to cover it up.
“Thank you so much for your love and support.” - IOL
