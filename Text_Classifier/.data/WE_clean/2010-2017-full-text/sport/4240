Sian Massey withdrawn as assistant referee for Crewe v Bradford in wake of Sky sexism scandal
There was due to be a large media interest at Gresty Road which was only going to get worse with news that Andy Gray has been fired by Sky.
However, the referees association have taken steps to quell the situation and have removed Massey from Tuesday night's game.
PGMO general manager Mike Riley said: "PGMO and Sian believe that, with any football match, the focus should not be on the officials but on the players and the game itself.
"Sian is an excellent professional who has unwittingly found herself in the middle of a story that has nothing to do with her competence as a match official.
"Sian only wants to be notable for her performance as an assistant referee and is keen for things to get back to normal so she can return to officiating as soon as possible.
"Sian has the full backing of PGMO and we hope she continues her development, which has shown excellent progress so far.
"It is important for PGMO to have talented people from all backgrounds getting involved in refereeing.
"The more people are attracted to the game, the better standards will be, and the more everyone can talk about the football."
