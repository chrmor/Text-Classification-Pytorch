Australia's Swan 'disposed to reject' market tie-up: ASX
Australia's Treasurer Wayne Swan believes the proposed merger of the Australian and Singapore stock exchanges is against the national interest, the ASX said Tuesday.
The ASX said Singapore had been advised that Swan was "disposed to the view, under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, that the proposed merger of the ASX and SGX should be rejected as contrary to the national interest."
The Singapore exchange said it had been asked to provide further comments to Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board on the decision.
The ASX and SGX announced plans last October to create one of the world's largest and most diversified financial trading hubs.
But political disquiet has been growing in Australia, with concerns raised over foreign ownership and Singapore's democracy and rights record.
