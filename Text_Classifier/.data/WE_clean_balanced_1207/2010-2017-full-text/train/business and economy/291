Honda recalls almost 400,000 cars
Honda Motor Co is recalling the popular Accord and Civic passenger cars to address problems with an ignition switch that could allow the key to be removed without the transmission being shifted into park, its third recall over the problem since 2003.
Honda said the most recent recall involved 384,220 vehicles and includes 2003 model year Accord and Civics and 2003-04 versions of the Honda Element.
Honda told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the defect with the automatic transmissions could lead to a vehicle rolling away and increase the risk of a crash.
The Japanese carmaker said in a statement the recall would involve about 197,000 Accords, 117,000 Civics and 69,000 Elements.
The company said it has received several complaints about the ignition interlock and "is aware of a small number of related incidents, including one that resulted in a minor injury".
Honda said the ignition interlock mechanism could be damaged or worn during use and "it may become possible to remove the ignition key when the shift lever is not in park". Unless the parking brake is set, the vehicle could roll away under those circumstances and lead to a crash.
