C.B.O. Has Clear Message About Losers in House Health Bill
Republicans have argued that the bill’s waivers would not hurt insurance access for people with pre-existing health conditions, thanks to state funding devoted to high-risk pools subsidizing their coverage. The C.B.O. essentially dismissed that idea, saying that the state funds would not be enough to protect sick customers from huge bills.
Premiums for healthier customers would go down in those states, though some people might end up buying plans so flimsy that the budget office said they didn’t count as insurance. A second set of states that pursued more limited waivers of insurance rules could enjoy premiums some 20 percent lower than expected under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for more limited benefits, it said.
Republicans have argued that letting states waive the insurance rules would lead to a more robust and attractive insurance market. The C.B.O. disagreed with that argument, too. It said that markets in the states with waivers would become smaller than under an earlier version of the bill that did not include the waivers. In response, more employers would offer workers coverage, it said, since they would see individual coverage as an unattractive alternative.
Over all, the budget office found that the law would mean 23 million more people would lack insurance than under current law, a slight decrease from its assessment of an earlier draft that did not include the waivers. But it noted that the group without insurance would not be precisely the same as it would under the earlier bill. The uninsured would be more likely to be the kind of patients who rely on health insurance most.
