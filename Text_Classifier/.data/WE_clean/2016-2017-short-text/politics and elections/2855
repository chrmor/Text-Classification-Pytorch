Georgia Senator David Perdue is criticized for remarks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference in which his quote of Psalm 109:8, "Let his days be few, and may another have his office," appears to be a prayer for President Barack Obama’s death. Perdue says, "It was a little humor and I said it in a way that we were talking about his days as president." (UPI) (The Daily Beast)
