Wreck kills 35 in Ecuador, Red Cross says
(CNN) -- At least 35 people have been killed and 20 others injured in a wreck in Ecuador, the Red Cross said Friday.
The wreck happened around 4 a.m. near Flavio Alfaro, the organization said. That's roughly 100 miles west of the capital of Quito, in the province of Manabi.
Ecuavisa, a CNN affiliate in Ecuador, reported that the wreck happened when a bus fell about 650 feet (200 meters) into a ravine while traveling from Quito to the town of San Isidro.
