IDF Transfers Humanitarian Aid From Gaza Flotilla to Gaza Strip
IDF forces unload the humanitarian cargo from the Gaza Flotilla and bring the aid through the Kerem Shalom crossing. An average of 10,000 tons of aid a week are imported into the Gaza Strip in coordination with international organizations through the land crossings. However, there remains a maritime closure on the strip as Hamas continues to smuggle weapons through tunnels for use against Israeli civilians.
