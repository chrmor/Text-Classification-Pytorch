Darwin bombing was 'our Pearl Harbour'
Prime Minister Julia Gillard has described the bombing of Darwin during World War II as Australia’s Pearl Harbour and says more Australians must learn about the attack.
Ms Gillard, who is in Darwin for the 70th anniversary commemorations, said the bombing was an important event in Australia’s history, marking the first time Australia was attacked on home soil.
Governor-General Quentin Bryce, meanwhile, described the day Darwin was bombed by the Japanese in 1942 as one of immense significance that stands alongside Australia Day and Anzac Day in the nation’s hearts and minds.
Ms Bryce told the audience of more than 4,000 at Darwin’s cenotaph that the day caused Australia to shed its reliance on Britain and realise its security rested on the cementing of an alliance with the US.
The prime minister said she did not learn about the bombing at school, and there was an effort by the government at the time to downplay the event and the number of casualties to protect national morale.
‘‘For too many Australians the history remains unknown,’’ Ms Gillard told the Seven Network in an interview broadcast on Sunday.
