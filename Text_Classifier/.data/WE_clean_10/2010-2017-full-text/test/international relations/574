Russia Vetoes U.N. Demand for End to Bombing of Syria's Aleppo
UNITED NATIONS â€” Russia vetoed a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution on Saturday that would have demanded an immediate end to air strikes and military flights over Syria's Aleppo city and called for a truce and humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.
It is the fifth time Russia has vetoed a U.N. resolution on Syria during the more than five-year conflict. The previous four times Moscow was backed by Beijing, but on Saturday China abstained from the vote.
