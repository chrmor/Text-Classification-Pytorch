Protectionist wins the Cup
German stayer Protectionist simply ran away from his rivals to win the $6.2 million Melbourne Cup by an easy four lengths under star international jockey Ryan Moore.
Second home – for the third time in his illustrious career – was English trained warhorse Red Cadeaux, piloted by French rider Gerald Mosse. Sydney-trained ex-New Zealander Who Shot Thebarman, partnered by Glen Boss – the man forever associated with triple winner Makybe Diva – came in third.
The well fancied Signoff, from the Darren Weir stable, was a brave fourth in front of the Godolphin hope Willing Foe.
The Japanese trained Caulfield Cup winner Admire Rakti, was prominent early but was one of the first beaten as the field turned into the home straight and, perhaps anchored by his 58.5 kilo burden, fell back through the field to finish last.
