Shia LaBeouf wears paper bag on his head, walks out of ‘Nymphomaniac’ presser
Shia LaBeouf inexplicably stormed out of a Berlin press conference for his new film "Nymphomaniac" on Sunday, after answering only one question.
The "Fury" actor, 27, responded to the lone question — about his many sex scenes in the Lars von Trier film — with an arbitrary caveat, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
"When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much," he reportedly said, before walking away.
The line is a quote from French soccer legend Eric Cantona, as recited in the movie "Looking for Eric," THR reports. The film ends with footage of Cantona at a press conference where he made the seagulls statement while the credits roll.
LaBeouf's questionable display apparently included his appearance. He walked the red carpet with a paper bag on his head which read "I am not famous anymore." It's the same sentence he has been repeating on his Twitter page since January 13. 
 The actor looked unkempt and even had a missing bottom tooth, according to THR. He shaved the tooth down for his role in "Fury," the magazine reports, and was also noticeably thinner.
The "Charlie Countryman" actor lunged after three young men who tried to take his photo at the Ritz Carlton lounge, THR reports. A few of his acquaintances reportedly had to intervene.
It's the latest of a series of bizarre antics from LaBeouf.
In January, he was caught on video head-butting a man during a London bar fight.
And, after months of media scrutiny and Internet backlash over a plagiarism claim involving the work of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes, LaBeouf issued a series of borrowed Twitter "apologies," culminating in a declaration that he would be "retiring from all public life."
While that was short-lived, the actor came back weeks later saying that his unconventional behavior was all for "performance art."
