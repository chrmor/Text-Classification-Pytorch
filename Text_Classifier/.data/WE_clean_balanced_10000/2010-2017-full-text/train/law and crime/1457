Under-fire Hilton Botha quits SAPS
Johannesburg - Hilton Botha, the former lead detective in the murder case involving Paralympian Oscar Pistorius, has resigned from the SA Police Service, police confirmed on Thursday.
"He gave notice with immediate effect yesterday [Wednesday]," Brigadier Neville Malila said.
"The reasons given are between himself and the organisation. It is a personal decision ultimately."
Malila said Botha had been an investigator for many years and a member of the police for more than 22 years.
"It is a lot of experience that we are losing, but it is his personal decision."
Botha's removal from the Pistorius case followed reports in February that he was charged with attempted murder.
Police later confirmed that he had seven attempted murder pending. In 2011 Botha allegedly fired shots at a minibus while trying to stop the vehicle.
Seven people were in the taxi at the time.
