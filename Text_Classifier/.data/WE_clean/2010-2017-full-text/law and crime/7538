Former Egyptian minister sentenced to 5 years
(CNN) -- Egypt's former trade minister on Saturday was convicted in absentia of profiteering and unlawfully taking money from the country's Export Development Fund.
The criminal court of Cairo sentenced Rashid Mohamed Rashid to five years in prison and fined him nearly 9.4 million Egyptian pound ($1.6 million).
He is the latest in a number of former Cabinet members to be convicted of crimes during the presidency of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Last month, former Tourism Minister Zoheir Garranah was also sentenced to five years in prison for squandering public funds and illegal profiteering.
Also in May, Interior Minister Habib El Adly was handed a 12-year prison sentence for corruption. He will face a separate trial on May 21 for his role in the killing of protesters during the unrest.
Former Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali is also charged with squandering public funds. He fled the country on February 12.
Mubarak himself will face trial for allegedly ordering the killings of protesters, officials have said. His two sons have also been detained in connection with the deaths of protesters during the unrest that led to Mubarak's resignation.
Several other former top government officials are under investigation for corruption, prosecutors say.
