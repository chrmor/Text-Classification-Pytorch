Nigeria finds weapons in cargo
Nigeria - Nigerian authorities on Tuesday intercepted a shipment of weapons - including rocket launchers and grenades - at a port in the economic capital of Lagos, an intelligence agency spokesperson said.
The discovery occurred as a result of additional security following twin car bombings in the capital Abuja on October 1 that killed at least 12 people, said Marilyn Ogar.
Security agents intercepted 13 containers at the port and had opened one so far, finding the weaponry, she said.
“We've been able to open just one container, and in a container you have 24 crates,” she said.
“Out of the 24, we've opened eight so far. Out of the eight, four are filled with floor tiles, while the other four contain rocket launchers, grenades, explosives and mortars.”
She said authorities planned to work throughout the night to open all the containers. She declined to comment on where the shipment had come from and whether any arrests had been made, citing the ongoing investigation. - Sapa-AFP
