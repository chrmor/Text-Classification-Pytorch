Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has set a one-day sales record, taking in $400 million in North America and Britain, and game publisher Activision is popping open the bubbly â€” and the hype.

Eric Hirshberg, CEO of the company's Activision Publishing unit, called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 "more than a game. It's become a major part of the pop cultural landscape."
High-flying words, but 6.5 million units sold in 24 hours in North America and Britain give the hoopla some validation.
