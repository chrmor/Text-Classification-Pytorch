RESCUERS have cut three more people from the wreckage of a capsized Chinese cruise ship as workers battle to find more than 400 people still missing after the boat sank in the storm-tossed Yangtze river.
A TOTAL of 15 people have so far been saved from the Dongfangzhixing, or "Eastern Star," which went down late Monday on the popular tourist route from the eastern city of Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
