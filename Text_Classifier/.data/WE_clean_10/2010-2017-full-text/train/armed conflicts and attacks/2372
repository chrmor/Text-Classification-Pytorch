Egypt kills two migrants entering Israel
CAIRO, Jan. 22 (UPI) -- Egyptian police say they intercepted and killed two African migrants who were apparently trying to sneak across the Israeli border in Sinai during the weekend.
The details of the incident were not revealed but Bikyamasr.com said Egypt's handling of illegal immigrants passing through Sinai en route to Israel has been criticized by human rights activists as a "shoot first" policy against unarmed civilians.
Bikyamasr.com said Sunday that Israel estimates about 10,000 Africans have entered the Jewish state illegally in the past few years, most looking for jobs.
A number of migrants from Somalia and other African nations also complain about being stuck in Egypt after being unable to cross into Israel. "I know a lot of people who would rather risk being killed on the border than continue to sit around Cairo and be faced with all these troubles because of our status," one refugee told Bikyamasr.com. "We can't even work."
