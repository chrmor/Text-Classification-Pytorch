Russian plane black box recording 'confirms bomb explosion caused jet crash' killing 224 people
The black box audio recording from the Russian passenger jet which crashed in the Siani desert killing 224 people confirms the plane was brought down by a bomb, it has been claimed.
Air crash investigators have successfully managed to read its contents in a bid to discover what brought the Airbus A321 crashing down six days ago, according to France news website Le Point.fr .
One expert told the newspaper the certain cause of the crash was not a technical fault or pilot error but a bomb brought in from outside and planted in the plane.
The experts, from Russia, France, Germany and Ireland - aided by the Egyptian civil aviation authority, have been working to decode the flight recorders since the day after the crash.
They said the cockpit voice recorder, which recorded what was said in the cockpit, confirmed that an explosion had occurred.
However, Russian media claim the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster.
Sources close to the investigation reportedly told Kommersant claim say the flight data recorder "abruptly" stopped working just over 20 minutes from takeoff.
They claim it didn't vie any clues over the nature of the catastrophe which hit the plane.
Just hours after the plane was brought down ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, and this new information makes their claim seem more and more likely.
It now rests with the Egyptian authorities to officially confirm the cause of the attack.
Amid fears that the plane was downed by a bomb planted on board, sources close to the investigation told the respected Moscow newspaper that the data recorder "has shown that for the entire duration of the flight, which continued for a little longer than 20 minutes, all systems of the A321 were operating properly.
"After takeoff, the plane, which was on autopilot, almost gained the altitude needed to enter its assigned flight level.
"However, something happened, after which the recording of absolutely all parameters of the airplane systems' work abruptly stopped."
Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin has announced Russia has suspended all flights to Egypt.
The news came shortly after Russian intelligence chief Alexander Bortnikov advised halting travel to the country until the cause of the crash had been established in televised comments.
He said: "I think it will be reasonable to suspend all Russian flights to Egypt until we determine the real reasons of what happened.
“It concerns tourist flights most of all.”
But a Kremlin spokesman said that Mr. Putin’s decision did not mean that the crash was caused by a terrorist act.
Egypt is Russia's most popular tourist destination and there are believed to be roughly 45,000 Russian tourists already in Egypt including Sharm el Sheikh, who are trying to get home.
