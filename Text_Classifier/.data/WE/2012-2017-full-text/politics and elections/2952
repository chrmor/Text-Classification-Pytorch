Russia: We have guarantees Assad won't move or use Syria's chemical weapons -  Haaretz - Israel News
The Russian Foreign Ministry's point man on Syria said on Thursday that Moscow has guarantees from the Syrian government that it will not use or move its chemical weapons.
Speaking in an interview to The Associated Press, Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said that Russia is working closely with the Syrian government to make sure its arsenal of chemical weapons remains securely in place and does not fall into the hands of terrorists.
President Barack Obama warned earlier this week that the United States might be forced to intervene in the Syrian civil war if the Syrian government were to use or move such weapons of mass destruction.
Obama said that if Syria were to use chemical or biological weapons, this would be a "red line" for the U.S.
"We have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is [if] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation," Obama said.
Gatilov said Russia is in full agreement with the Americans on the need to prevent Syria's chemical weapons from being used.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Network for Human Rights said that 109 people were killed across Syria by security force gunfire on Thursday, according to an Al Arabiya report. Al Arabiya also reported that a Syrian activist group fears that Assad's forces was set to execute 100 prisoners in the Jobar neighborhood of Syria's capital Damascus. Â
