Three men appear in Newry court on terrorism charges
Three men have appeared before Newry Magistrate's Court charged with threats to kill, INLA membership and blackmail.
In the dock were Michael Smith, 41, of Ardmonagh Gardens in Belfast, Damien Morgan, 43, of Vicinage Park, Belfast and Patrick McCrory, 54, of Mountpottinger Road, Belfast.
All three were remanded in custody to reappear on 9 May.
The court ordered that the identity of the injured party should not be disclosed.
A detective told the court the wife of the blackmail victim had contacted police after her husband told her of the threats made by the accused on Saturday.
The detective said the husband had told his wife that the accused claimed they were from the INLA and wanted Â£35,000 by the following day or else the husband would be killed.
A solicitor for one of the accused asked why no written statement had been taken from the injured party.
The detective said that the injured party, currently living at an undisclosed address, would be making a written statement.
