do you agree with Roy Keane and the referee.... or do you side with everyone else?
Ferguson left the field angrily pointing his finger at Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir, who sent off Nani for a high tackle on Alvaro Arbeloa. The red card transformed the match as United were leading 1-0 before being reduced to 10 men.
A "distraught" Sir Alex Ferguson was described as being too angry to speak to the media afterwards, with his asistant Mike Phelan saying: "That is probably an understatement. I donâ€™t think the manager is in any fit state to talk about the decision."
However, former United star Keane refused to side with his former manager and stuck up for the referee.
He said: "I think the referee has actually made the right call. Everyone's upset about it and it's slightly unlucky, but it's dangerous play. Whether he meant it or not is irrelevant. It's dangerous play - it's a red card."
But what do you think? Have your say and vote...
