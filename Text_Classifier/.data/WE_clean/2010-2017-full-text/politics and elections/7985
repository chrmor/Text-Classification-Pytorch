Ron Paul Opts to Give Up House Seat
Rep. Ron Paul said Tuesday he wouldn't run for re-election to the House so he can focus on his campaign for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.
"Running for two offices as I have in the past was deserving of some criticism," the Texas Republican said in an interview. "I will continue to do what I've been doing for 30 years: promoting individual liberty, sound economic policy and bringing our troops home."
