ideal chance for miners to quit smoking
COPIAPO, Chile: The 33 men trapped deep inside a northern Chilean mine have been given permission to smoke after improvements were made in the air ventilation.
The miners will receive two cigarette packs a day, the regional Atacama governor, Ximena Matas, said.
''We have sent a number of cigarettes â€¦ to a person who will distribute them, and there should be no difficulties,'' Ms Matas said.
The trapped miners have become national heroes since they were found alive on August 22, 17 days after a mine cave-in in the remote Atacama desert. The miners are trapped about 700 metres below the surface.
The miners have been receiving supplies - food, water and now cigarettes - through a metal shaft to the surface.
Nicotine patches sent down to help smokers among the trapped miners deal with the lack of cigarettes had not worked, officials said.
