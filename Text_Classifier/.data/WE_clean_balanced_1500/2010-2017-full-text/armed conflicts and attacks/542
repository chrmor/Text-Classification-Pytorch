Palestinian shot in East Jerusalem clash
A Jewish settlement guard has shot and killed a Palestinian man in East Jerusalem after residents pelted his car with stones, Israeli police say.
The shooting in the Silwan neighbourhood then sparked protests in which five Palestinians were wounded.
Clashes are common in Silwan, where Israeli officials plan to raze 22 Palestinian homes for a tourist park.
The building of Jewish settlements is one of the thorniest issues in the newly resumed Middle East peace talks.
The Palestinians have threatened to walk out of peace talks unless a partial construction freeze, due to expire on 26 September, is extended.
On Tuesday, the international Quartet of Middle East peace mediators urged Israel to extend the freeze, which only applies to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
There have been frequent clashes in Silwan, where the Jerusalem municipality has approved plans to demolish Palestinian homes to make room for an Israeli archaeological park.
The UN has called the plan illegal and "unhelpful" to peace efforts.
On Wednesday morning, a security guard shot a 32-year-old Palestinian man after his car was blocked and stoned by dozens of Palestinians, Israeli police said.
After the shooting, a crowd of protesters hurled more stones at the police, who responded with tear gas.
Nearly half a million Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
They are held to be illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
