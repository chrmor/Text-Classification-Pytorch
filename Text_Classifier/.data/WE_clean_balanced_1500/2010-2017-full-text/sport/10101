Oltra sacked as Deportivo boss
Deportivo announced Sunday that manager Jose Oltra has been sacked due to a poor start to the La Liga season.
Club president Augusto Cesar Lendoiro announced the news at a press conference on Sunday and even hinted that Oltra's replacement could be named sooner rather than later.
"We felt that now was the right time for a change," Lendoiro said. "In the next few hours, or even tomorrow, we hope to introduce the new coach."
Deportivo has managed just two wins in Spain's top flight this season, leaving the club bottom of the table with just 12 points through 17 matches.
