Expelled UUP man joins UKIP
A Northern Ireland Assembly member, who was expelled from the Ulster Unionist Party in the summer, has joined the UK Independence party.
Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP and its deputy leader Paul Nuttall, both MEPs, are due to officially welcome David McNarry, who represents Strangford, into the party at Stormont tomorrow.
Prior to Mr McNarry signing up for UKIP the party had just one elected representative in Northern Ireland, Henry Reilly, a member of Newry and Mourne Council.
Mr McNarry was expelled from the Ulster Unionists in May following an internal party row over a media interview he gave earlier in the year about unity discussions that were held between the DUP and the UUP.
He has since sat in the Assembly as a unionist independent. He is the first UKIP representative in any of devolved assemblies in Britain and Northern Ireland. The party has 12 MEPs but no seats in the House of Commons.
Mr Farage said he was delighted to welcome Mr McNarry as his party’s first MLA.
East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the public “must be wary” of UKIP policies.
“UKIP based their entire Northern Ireland manifesto at the 2011 Assembly elections on leaving the European Union. They have no interest in local Northern Ireland matters. They are a single issue party,” he said.
