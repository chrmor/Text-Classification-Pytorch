Tour of Flanders: Lizzie Armitstead second to retain World Cup lead
Britain's Lizzie Armitstead retained her lead in the World Cup by finishing second in the women's Tour of Flanders.
Armitstead's Dutch team-mate Ellen van Dijk, who broke clear on the final climb of the Paterberg, won the race.
Armitstead beat Sweden's Emma Johansson in a sprint finish to ensure her Boels-Dolmans team were first and second.
The Olympic silver medallist's second place is her third podium from three World Cup races in 2014 and she will keep her lead in the competition.
The Yorkshire-born rider won the opening race of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe and finished second in last week's Trofeo Alfredo Binda.
