IDF bombs Gaza Strip targets
Amid continued Qassam fire directed at Israel, the IDF on Saturday attacked targets across the Gaza Strip. Eye witnesses said some of the posts were completely destroyed. No injuries were reported.   
The IDF said that IAF aircrafts attacked two terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip center and a smuggling tunnel in the northern Strip. "The terror tunnel served terrorists infiltrating into Israel who carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers," it was stated.
Palestinian sources reported that IAF jets bombed targets in the neighborhood of Zeitoun, east of Gaza city, near the Musab bin Umar mosque.
Later on Saturday, sources reported that IAF jets also attacked targets in Deir al-Balah, located at the center of the Strip. An Izz al-Din al-Qassam post in Khan Younis was reportedly bombed as well.
Although no rocket landings have been reported inside Israel, Ofakim resident Ariel Mimran told Ynet that "you can feel the blast waves of the explosion. We heard no alarm here – it's strange – we never hear one."
On Friday, Palestinian militants fired two Qassam rockets at Israel . One exploded within the bounds of the Sdot Negev Regional Council and the other likely landed in Palestinian territory. No injuries or damage were reported.
Last Monday, the IDF launched two attacks on the Gaza Strip. At least one Palestinian was injured when IDF artillery fire targeted a terror cell near the defunct airport located east of Rafah. The army said the cell had launched terror attacks against Israeli targets in the past, but the Palestinians said one of those injured in the strike was a construction worker who was collecting gravel.
