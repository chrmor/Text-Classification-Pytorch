A Guide to the N.C.I.S. Investigative Report
The findings of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service inquiry into the detainee-abuse case are included in a report, which was redacted by the United States Navy. In nearly all cases, the redactions are of the names of American service members. Links to excerpts from the report appear below.
The first sworn statement to the Navy is from Staff Sgt. David Roschak, the ranking soldier at the outpost. The fourth and final statement is from Specialist David Walker, an Army medic. The two other soldiers asked not to be named in connection with a military investigation.
The soldiers were stationed at a small outpost in Kalach, Afghanistan, when Navy SEALs arrived to train the local police force. In their statements, the soldiers described discipline problems involving several of the SEALs that led to a series of incidents — rifles fired without warning for target practice, grenades tossed for sport, a civilian punched in the face — and then escalated into hours of detainee abuse after a bomb exploded at a checkpoint.
The Afghan Local Police beat the suspects, and the soldiers said that enlisted SEAL team members had later fired handguns next to the detainees’ heads, stood on their abdomens and dropped rocks on them. Two soldiers said that they had seen SEALs dump water on the faces of detainees lying on their backs, and that the detainees had appeared to be choking.
