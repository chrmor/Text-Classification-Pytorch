Israeli soldiers accidentally follow GPS into a Palestinian refugee camp and spark night of rioting
Two Israeli soldiers sparked a night of deadly rioting and shooting after they took a wrong turn into a Palestinian refugee camp while following a GPS app.
The pair were apparently following directions from the popular Waze app when they drove into the Qalandiya refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
A crowd of Palestinians attacked their jeep with stones and firebombs and the soldiers fled the vehicle.
One escaped the camp and reached a nearby Israeli settlement but the other plunged further into Qalandiya's tangled streets, according to Ynet.
Israeli ground troops, backed by helicopters, stormed into the camp to rescue the missing soldier but got caught up in clashes with young Palestinians.
A 22-year-old Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli troops while ten others were wounded, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Ten Israelis were also reportedly injured.
Moshe Ya'alon, the Israeli defence minister, appeared to voice some frustration at the young soldiers' reliance on technology.
“I learned ages ago the importance of navigating with the aid of a real map, and mainly to know the surrounding area and not to rely too heavily on technology which can lead the user astray,” he said.
Israel tends to deploy major force if it believes any of its soldiers are in danger of being taken prisoner.
The policy is sometimes known as "the Hannibal directive" and some claim it calls for Israeli forces to open fire even at the risk of killing the Israeli soldier who has been taken prisoner.
In 2006, a young Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas near the Gaza border and held for more than five years.
He was released in 2011 after Israel agreed to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
