Archaeologists in Israel have discovered a mysterious stone monument weighing 60,000 tons and rising 32 feet above the bottom of the Sea of Galilee.
Scientists don't know who built the structure, or why, but in a recent paper in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology the researchers shared a few hypotheses before concluding that further study is needed.
The mystery rock pile was first discovered in 2003 during a sonar survey of the bottom of the southwestern part of the sea. The sonar revealed a pile of boulders arranged in a circular shape, lying on the sea floor.
The structure, which cannot be seen from land, is massive -- about twice the diameter of Stonehenge.
Further study by a team of scuba-diving investigators revealed that the boulders are made of basalt and have no decorative chiseling or cutting. Individual boulders are as big as 3 feet across, and the lower half of the structure is covered by sand.
