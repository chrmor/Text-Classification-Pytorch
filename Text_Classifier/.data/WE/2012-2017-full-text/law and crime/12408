Two killed in Swedish restaurant shooting
Two men have been killed and up to 15 injured in a shooting in a restaurant in the south-western Swedish city of Gothenburg, police say.
They say automatic weapons - believed to be Kalashnikov assault rifles - were used in the attack late on Wednesday.
The men who died were between 20 and 25, police said.
Police spokeswoman Ulla Brehm was quoted as saying the shooting could have been gang-related.
One witness told Sweden's SVT broadcaster that two men entered the restaurant and opened fire.
"I didn't have a chance to think about what happened. Then I saw that my friend was bleeding. I tried to stop the bleeding as well as I could with my hand,'' said the witness, who did not give his name.
The attack happened as customers were watching a football game.
The gunmen are believed to have fled.
The police sealed off the area and launched a murder investigation.
On 30 January, a man was wounded in a shooting in the square outside the restaurant but it is not clear whether the shootings are linked.
Gun violence is not uncommon in Sweden's major cities, though shootings in public places with multiple victims are rare.
