Israeli forces level lands near border in southeastern Gaza
GAZA CITY (Ma’an) -- Israeli bulldozers leveled land east of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday morning, eyewitnesses said.
Witnesses told Ma’an that four “D9” bulldozers and a giant excavator escorted by Israeli military vehicles crossed the borderline between Israel and the besieged enclave before leveling land on the Palestinian side of the border, leaving shortly afterwards.
No gunfire or injuries were reported.
The Israeli military vehicles came from a military post near the al-Farahin area east of the Palestinian town of Abasan al-Kabira.
An Israeli army spokesperson told Ma’an that they were looking into the reports.
Israeli military incursions inside the besieged Gaza Strip and near the “buffer zone" which lies on both land and sea sides of Gaza, have long been a near-daily occurrence.
Palestinians who work near the “buffer zone” between the Palestinian enclave and Israel often come under fire from military forces, as the Israeli military has not made clear the precise area of the designated zone.
The Israeli army regularly open fires on Palestinian fisherman and farmers along the border areas, despite a ceasefire agreement that ended the 2014 war.
The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sectors of the blockaded coastal enclave.
