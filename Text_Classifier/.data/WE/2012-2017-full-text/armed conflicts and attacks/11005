Suicide blast kills dozens of rebel supporters in Yemen
At least 43 people were killed when a powerful suicide bombing ripped through the Yemeni capital Thursday, plunging the violence-plagued state into further turmoil after weeks of political deadlock. Dozens more were wounded in the attack in Sanaa's Al-Tahrir square, which targeted a gathering for supporters of Shiite insurgents who overran the capital last month. Supporters of the rebels, known as Houthis, gathered after the blast -- the largest in Sanaa since May 2012 -- demanding the fall of beleaguered President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi. Yemen remains in political deadlock after Hadi infuriated the rebels in Sanaa earlier this week by naming his chief of staff, Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, as prime minister as part of the U.N.'s reconciliation accord. Foes of the Houthi rebels -- who hail from the minority Zaidi Shiite community in Sunni-dominated Yemen -- accuse them of taking orders from Iran and groups behind the 2011 uprising which ousted Saleh have protested their presence in Sanaa.
