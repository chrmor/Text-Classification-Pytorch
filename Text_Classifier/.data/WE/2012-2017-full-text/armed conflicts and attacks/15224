Islamic State commander linked to slaying of Apache worker in Egypt has been killed
An operative for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria who masterminded the slaying of an Apache Corp. worker in Egypt last year has been killed by security forces in Cairo, according to media reports.
Aly Ashraf Hassanein al Gharabli ran operations for an ISIS-linked militant group that claimed responsibility last year for murdering William Henderson. Photos of his passport and work badges were published on an online forum for militants after he was found dead in a car on a road in the western Egyptian desert.
Gharabli was shot and killed by Egyptian police during a firefight that erupted during an arrest attempt. Gharbli has also been linked to the kidnapping and beheading of a Croatian national, the bombing of the Italian consulate in Cairo and an attempted attack on tourists in Luxor, Egypt.
Henderson, 58, had worked for Apache for more than two decades. He had been employed as a supervisor overseeing the company’s oil and gas operations in Karama, Egypt when he was shot and killed while driving on a desert road.
His murder, the first recent slaying of an American oil worker in Egypt, raised questions about the safety of oil and gas operations in the remote deserts of Egypt, which had been roiled by political instability since protesters in 2011 launched an uprising that overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak.
The Houston oil company, which has been active in Egypt since 1994, recently declared that it has become the largest oil and gas producer in Egypt, with gross production returning to the company’s peak levels in 2011 and 2012.
When reached for comment, Apache said the investigation into Henderson’s death was still ongoing, but that “the safety and security of our employees and their families are our top priority in Egypt.”
