Box Office: Oz the Great and Powerful Conjures Up $80.3 Million Opening Weekend
As expected, Oz the Great and Powerful worked its magic on a slumping box office, grossing an estimated $80.3 million in its Friday-Sunday debut, its studio reported.
The opening-weekend number is easily the biggest of the year, and the third-largest ever for a March release, behind only The Hunger Games and Johnny Depp's Alice in Wonderland.
The massively expensive Wizard of Oz prequel, starring James Franco, was graded a B-plus by audiences polled by CinemaScore.
