Large 7.9 earthquake in Papua New Guinea

The New Zealand Civil Defence earlier issued an official tsunami warning for all of New Zealand following the earthquake, but cancelled it half an hour later, saying there was no threat to New Zealand.
The quake knocked items off shelves and caused a blackout in the town of Kokopo in northeastern Papua New Guinea, but there were no reports of widespread damage in the town, the Associated Press reported.
