Riot continues at NT detention centre
Accused Indonesian people-smugglers have gone back to protesting on the roof of the Darwin immigration detention centre.
The Department of Immigration said the protesters, who began rioting just after 4am (CST) on Sunday, caused more damage to the centre overnight.
The protesters - Indonesian boat crew who face people-smuggling charges - set mattresses on fire and brandished poles on a roof at the centre on Sunday.
"One hundred and seventeen Indonesian detainees continue to protest," a spokesman told AAP on Monday afternoon.
"A number of clients remain on the roof. However, NT Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP) continue to negotiate with them in attempts to resolve the situation."
The federal police are yet to say if they will charge the protesters and would only say they were dealing with an "ongoing matter".
