PKK car bomb attack injures 8 in southeast
Eight people were injured when a bomb-laden car, targeting a police vehicle, detonated in the southeastern Diyarbakır province on Tuesday. According to Anadolu Agency correspondents at the scene, two policemen and six civilians were injured in the attack, which has been blamed on the PKK terrorist group, in the Dicle district of Diyarbakır. The injured people were immediately rushed to Dicle State Hospital. There was damage to nearby buildings after the bomb attack. Last week, the PKK and Kurdish Communities Union (KCK) – an umbrella network that includes the PKK – reportedly decided to move from the Qandil Mountains, which has been the organization's headquarters for many years, as a result of the Turkish Armed Forces' (TSK) continuous counterterrorism operations. Turkish media reported that the PKK has formed an alliance with the Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces militia to move to the Sulaymaniyah-Halabja line. The Turkish government has intensified its counter-terror operations following the recent attacks carried out by the PKK, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the EU and Turkey. Since then, around 600 security personnel, including troops, police officers, and village guards, have been martyred, and nearly 8000 PKK terrorists killed in operations across Turkey and northern Iraq. Formed in 1978, the terrorist group fought the Turkish government for an independent state until the early 2000's. The group then shifted its goal to autonomy in predominantly Kurdish inhabited regions of Turkey.
