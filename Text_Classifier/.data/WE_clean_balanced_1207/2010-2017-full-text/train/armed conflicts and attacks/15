U.S. Department of Defense Hacking Suspect Arrested in U.K.
British police arrested a 23-year-old man suspected of hacking into a U.S. Department of Defense internal communication system.
The attack on the Defense Department’s satellite messaging system on June 15, 2014, resulted in the theft of contact details for 800 employees and unique codes identifying 34,000 mobile devices, the U.K. National Crime Agency said in a statement.
The arrest in the town of Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands was part of a week-long series of raids by the NCA, police and other U.K. law enforcement agencies targeting cyber criminals. A total of 57 people were detained for a range of offenses including: hacking into government agencies and multinational companies, online fraud, and creating malicious software, the NCA said.
“Behind this week’s activity is the message that all of us, as individuals, businesses or law enforcement agencies, have a role to play in making the U.K. a safe place to enjoy the huge opportunities provided by the Internet,” said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA’s cyber crime unit.
Police also arrested two men for conspiracy and computer misuse relating to the theft of intellectual property from an unidentified London financial company, as well as a 21-year-old man accused of stealing more than 400,000 e-mail addresses and passwords from Yahoo! Inc. and posting them online in 2012.
The Department of Defense hacker posted screen shots of the attack on a website, with a message saying: “We’re in your bases, we control your satellites. The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads.”
The NCA said that no sensitive data was lost and U.S. national security wasn’t threatened.
The arrest shows the Department of Defense’s “commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals,” Jeffrey Thorpe, a Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service special agent, said in the NCA statement.
