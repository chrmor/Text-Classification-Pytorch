Ga executes Kelly Gissendaner after 3 denied appeals
Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2015 ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia executes woman convicted in husband's death; 1st woman executed in state in 70 years.
ATLANTA (AP) -- US Supreme Court denies 3rd appeal for stay of execution for lone woman on Georgia's death row
ATLANTA (AP) -- The latest on the scheduled execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row:
In yet another attempt to keep their client alive, lawyers for Kelly Renee Gissendaner have filed yet another stay of execution with the United States Supreme Court.
In the latest filing Gissendaner's lawyers ask, "Have societal standards of decency evolved to the point that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments now prohibit the execution of a capital defendant who did not physically participate in the murder of her victim?"
The 47-year-old was convicted of murder in the February 1997 slaying of her husband. She conspired with her lover, who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death.
