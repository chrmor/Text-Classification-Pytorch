Jewish Teacher Stabbed in France By ISIS Supporters
Three ISIS supporters stabbed a Jewish school teacher in France Wednesday, according to a French prosecutor.
The teacher was stabbed after being attacked in Marseilles by three people riding two scooters, prosecutor Bruce Robin told Reuters, but his life is not in danger. “The three people insulted, threatened and then stabbed their victim in the arm and leg. They were interrupted by the arrival of a car and fled,” said Robin.
According to Robin, one of the attackers was wearing an Islamic State t-shirt and another showed a picture of Mohamed Merah, who killed seven people during a 2012 rampage in southern France.
The stabbing comes as France is on high alert after a deadly terrorist attack in Paris last week and an early morning raid Wednesday that killed at least two suspects connected to the attacks.
