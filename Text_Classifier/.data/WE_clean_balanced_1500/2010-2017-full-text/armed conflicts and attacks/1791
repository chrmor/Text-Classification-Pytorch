IDF attacks gunmen near Khan Younis
The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday attacked a building in the al-Farahin area, east of the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis, where gunmen were believed to be hiding after placing explosive device on the border fence.
Palestinian sources in Strip reported of exchanges of fire between gunmen and IDF soldiers in the afternoon hours. There were no reports of injuries.
The same sources reported that the forces fired several missiles from planes and tank shells at a deserted building in Kahn Younis. Sources from another area in the Gaza town reported seeing IDF tanks moving towards the Palestinian territory.
Earlier, unknown assailants opened fire at a community in the Ashkelon Coast Regional Council, near the border fence. There were no reports of injuries, but an office and windshield sustained damage. Sappers were dispatched to the area, and security forces are checking whether the shots were fired from Gaza.
Two explosive devices exploded Wednesday next to soldiers patrolling the border fence area, near Kissufim. There were no reports of injuries. Another explosive device found in the area was not activated.
On Tuesday, a mortar shell was fired towards the western Negev. There were no reports of injuries or damage.
