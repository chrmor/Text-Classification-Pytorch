Southcentral Alaskans rattled by magnitude 6.2 earthquake
It was felt in Fairbanks, where her office is located, Ruppert said, and as far south as Kodiak, Valdez and Seward. Chickaloon resident Kendra Zamzow said in an email that she felt it from her hillside yurt. In a Carrs grocery store in West Anchorage, jars of spaghetti sauce and bottles of shampoo were shaken off shelves, leaving the floor splattered with spilled product.
"Everyone ran to see that everyone was OK," she said. At the time, she was in the kitchen, where the earthquake rocked the freezer, knocked boxes of noodles from a shelf and shook the congregation's brand-new challah dough mixer, a machine capable of making dough for 50 loaves at a time, Greenberg said.
And at the Alaska Zoo, a playful group of wolves scattered as the quake began. Theylet out howls, deep, long and loud. As leaves shook from the trees and fences began rattling and clanking, some wolves hunched over in the corners of the enclosure while others ran to higher ground, still howling. By the temblor's end, the animals regrouped, tails between their legs, whimpering.
Like their contemporaries at Wasilla High, students at Palmer and Houston high schools hunkered under desks and doorways and kept clear of windows when the shaking started. But despite the epicenter's proximity to Matanuska-Susitna Borough communities, there were no reports of damage "other than books and knickknacks falling off shelves" and no quake-related 911 calls, said borough emergency manager Casey Cook.
