Djokovic beats Murray to win Aussie Open
Novak Djokovic claimed his second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open on Sunday with a dominant display which thwarted Andy Murray's bid to become Britain's first male major-winner in 75 years.
The Serbian world number three controlled the final on a warm Melbourne evening, winning 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 for his second Australian title, after also triumphing in 2008.
It was the first major final without Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer for three years, as Djokovic proved superior to the listless fifth seed and afterwards stripped down to his shorts in celebration.
But the disappointing Murray suffered further heartbreak and is now yet to win a set in three Grand Slam finals.
Murray was bidding to become the first British man to win a Grand Slam since Fred Perry in 1936, and the first from the country to win the Australian Open since 1934.
But he was never in the hunt as his game fell away in the second set and Djokovic ramped up the pressure to take the final in straight sets in 2hr 39 min.
