Foreign Minister Stephen Smith has confirmed three Australians were among those killed in a plane crash on a remote island in Papua New Guinea.
Mr Smith says a Cessna Citation jet was carrying three Australians and two New Zealand citizens when it crashed on Misima Island on Tuesday.
Locals say the Trans Air flight overshot the runway in wet and windy weather, crashed into trees and burst into flames killing four of those on board.
Mr Smith says one of the New Zealanders, an Australian permanent resident who is believed to be one of the pilots, survived the accident with only heavy bruising.
Among the dead is a 61-year-old marine pilot from Sydney who was working for the Brisbane-based company Australian Reef Pilots.
The man was due to guide a boat into Australian waters.
Officials from the Australian High Commission left Port Moresby for Misima Island early this morning.
Meanwhile there is a heavy security presence outside Trans Air, with at least 10 guards are patrolling its entrance at Jacksons airport near Port Moresby.
Trans Air PNG is an offshoot of the company that was involved in the Lockhart River air crash that killed 15 people in far north Queensland in 2005.
Last year the Civil Aviation Safety Authority refused the company permission to fly in Australia, but that decision was overturned on appeal.
The company operates charter and medivac flights in Australia.
This is the third fatal plane crash in Papua New Guinea in just over 12 months.
Six people died in light plane crash in January. Nine Australians were among 13 killed when a plane crashed into a mountain near Kokoda in August last year.
