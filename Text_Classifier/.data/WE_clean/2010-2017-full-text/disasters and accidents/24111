State of emergency declared in Tripoli over trash
A state of emergency was declared in the Peloponnesian town of Tripoli on Saturday as trash has not been collected from the streets for almost three months.
The decision was taken by Peloponnese Governor Petros Tatoulis, who instructed Tripoli Municipality to designate an area where the refuse could be temporarily moved while the areaâ€™s long-standing waste management problems are resolved.
Tatoulis added that the municipality would also have to assume responsibility for ensuring that a fire does not break out at the site and that it is restored to its previous state after the garbage is removed.
