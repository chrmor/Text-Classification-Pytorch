Rafael Nadal, His Brilliance Undimmed by the Years, Wins His 10th French Open
PARIS — Growing up as a prodigy on the Spanish island of Majorca, Rafael Nadal dreamed of winning just one French Open title.
Now he has 10.
Nadal has always been a modest superstar, avoiding public displays of entitlement with the same assiduity that he employs arranging the beverage bottles on the court in front of his chair. But there could be no avoiding the encomiums or the obvious on Sunday as Nadal, after a nervous start, crushed the suspense out of another French Open final against a strong opponent, routing Stan Wawrinka, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1, in 2 hours 5 minutes.
“Rafa, this is one of the most beautiful exploits in the history of sport,” Fabrice Santoro, the former French star turned French Open interviewer, said as he approached Nadal on the court just after his quest for a 10th title — La Décima, in his native Spanish — became a reality.
It is no doubt a sporting achievement for the ages: No other men’s tennis player has won more than seven singles titles at the same Grand Slam event. And it is also surely time for a new favorite number for Nadal.
