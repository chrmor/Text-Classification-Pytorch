Syrian ship carrying aid for Gaza docks in Egypt -  Haaretz - Israel News
A Syrian ship carrying aid to be delivered to the Gaza Strip docked in the Egyptian port of El-Arish early Monday morning, Israel Radio reported.
The ship reportedly contains 650 tons of food and medical supplies that will be unloaded at El-Arish and delivered to the Gaza Strip via land.
In mid-July, a Libyan-sponsored aid ship also docked in El-Arish with supplies that were later delivered to the Gaza Strip.
Also on Monday, Israel permitted a shipment of 20 private vehicles to enter the Gaza Strip, for the first time since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007.
The vehicles were delivered via the Kerem Shalom border crossing on the Israel-Gaza Strip border.
Since May, when nine pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed as Israeli naval commandos intercepted a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, Israel has eased some of its restrictions on what can enter Gaza via Israel.
