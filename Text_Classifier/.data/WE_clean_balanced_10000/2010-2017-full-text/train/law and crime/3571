Tourist kidnapped in Egypt's Sinai
Two tourists, an Israeli man and a Norwegian woman, have been kidnapped by armed men in the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, security officials said.
The tourists were seized while travelling between Taba and Dahab in the south of the peninsula, reports said.
Such hostage in Sinai takings are usually resolved quickly.
Security in the desert region has deteriorated since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak two years ago.
Egyptian Bedouins have pressed for the release of captive tribesmen they say have been sentenced unfairly on charges ranging from terrorism to drug dealing and people trafficking across the border into Israel.
