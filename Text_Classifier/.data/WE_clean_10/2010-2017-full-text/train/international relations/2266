Asean, India conclude trade pact
New Delhi -- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and India on Thursday successfully concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement in services and investment.
Speaking at an India-Asean commemorative summit in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said: "This represents a valuable milestone in our relationship. I am confident it will boost our economic ties in much the same way the FTA in goods has done."
The two parties reached a trade deal on goods in 2010 but India has pushed for extending the agreement to services and investment.
India and Asean have set a bilateral trade target of US$100 billion (3 billion baht) by 2015. Two-way trade currently stands at $80 billion.
The two sides also agreed on a vision document laying out a roadmap for future cooperation across all sectors.
The heads of state or governments of all the Asean member nations except the Philippines are attending the two-day summit. The latter member is being represented by its vice president, the Indian Foreign Ministry said.
The summit commemorates the 10th anniversary of summit-level meetings between India and Asean and the 20th anniversary of formal engagement between the two.
