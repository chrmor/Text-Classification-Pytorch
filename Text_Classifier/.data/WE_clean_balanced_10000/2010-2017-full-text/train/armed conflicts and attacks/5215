Jakarta. The ten Indonesians who were held hostage by members of the Filipino terrorism group Abu Sayyaf have been released by their captors at noon on Sunday (01/05), local media reported.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Supt. Wilfredo Cayat the police chief of Sulu, an autonomous archipelago province of the Philippines where the ten were believed to be held captive, as saying: "there were anonymous people who dropped the Indonesians just in front of the house of Sulu Governor [Abdusakur] Toto Tan [II].‚Äù
Cayat said the Indonesians, who were abducted after their tugboat and barge were hijacked by the rebels on March 28, were brought inside the governor's home and were fed. The governor later informed the superintendent and turned over the ten into police custody.
The ten is scheduled to be brought to Zamboanga city in the southwestern tip of the Mindanao island where Indonesian officials have been monitoring developments of the abduction. The Inquirer reported that the crew members: Peter Tonson, Julian Philip, Alvian Elvis Peti, Mahmud, Surian Syah, Surianto, Wawan Saputria, Bayu Oktavianto, Reynaldi and Wendi Raknadian are well and unharmed. The release came after Coordinating Minister for Security Luhut Pandjaitan said on April 19 that the crew members' employer, Patria Maritime Lines, agreed to pay the 50 million peso ($1 million) ransom demanded by the Filipino rebel group. A source told the Inquirer that the ransom had been paid to the kidnappers. A different faction of the same group is believed to be holding four more Indonesians hostage during a separate attack. The four's whereabouts are unknown. Show More
