Qantas grounds A380s after explosion
Qantas has grounded its A380 superjumbos after a mid-air engine explosion forced a jet carrying 459 people to make a dramatic emergency landing in Singapore.
The explosion tore through the aircraft's second engine about 15 minutes after the Sydney-bound QF32 plane took off from Singapore's Changi Airport on Thursday morning.
The explosion rained debris on a downtown area of the Indonesian island of Batam.
None of the 433 passengers of 26 crew members were injured but there were unconfirmed reports that two people on the ground were hurt by debris.
The Qantas pilots immediately sought clearance to return to Singapore and the double-decker superjumbo, trailing smoke, touched down safely at about 11.45am local time (1445 AEDT).
Just hours later the carrier's chief executive, Alan Joyce, announced all six of its A380s had been grounded until further notice.
