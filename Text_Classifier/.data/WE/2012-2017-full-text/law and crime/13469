David Sweat, New York Prison Escapee, Shot and Captured Near Canadian Border
Convicted murderer and escaped inmate David Sweat was shot near the Canadian border Sunday by a New York State Police officer, according to authorities. He was listed in critical condition Sunday night.
"The nightmare is finally over," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference late Sunday. "It took 22 days, but ... let's give a big applause to the men and women of law enforcement who did a great job."
Sweat was wounded but is alive and was taken into custody, state police said. He was spotted by Sgt. Jay Cook about 3:20 p.m. ET in the town of Constable, less than six miles from the Canadian border, police said in a statement.
Cook thought Sweat looked suspicious and told him to "freeze," and when Sweat didn't, Cook shot him twice in the torso before he could run to the tree line, officials said. Sweat was then handcuffed, taken into custody and placed on a gurney, the sources said.
Sweat was transported to Albany Medical Center. In a news conference Sunday night, the center's director, Dennis McKenna, declined to discuss details of Sweat's condition, saying only that he was being treated by trauma surgeons and kept in a secure, locked unit.
