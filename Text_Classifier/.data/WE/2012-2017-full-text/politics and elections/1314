North Korea threatens to reduce South Korea’s leadership to ashes
PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA—North Korea’s military warned Monday of imminent “special actions” that would reduce South Korea’s conservative government to ashes within minutes, sharply escalating the rhetoric against its southern rival.
The threat from the North’s military leadership comes amid concerns that North Korea may be plotting another provocation in the wake of an unsuccessful rocket launch condemned by the UN Security Council as a violation of a ban against missile activity.
North Korea characterized the April 13 rocket launch as a failed bid to send a satellite into space — not a disguised test of missile technology — but then followed up two days later by unveiling a new long-range missile at a military birthday parade for late President Kim Il Sung.
There are new concerns that North Korea may conduct a nuclear test as it did after rocket launches in 2006 and 2009. South Korean intelligence officials say recent satellite images show the North has been digging a new tunnel in what could be preparation for a third atomic test.
“Nuclear weapons are not the monopoly of the United States,” Lt. Col. Nam Dong Ho told the Associated Press on Monday on the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, saying North Korea needs atomic weapons to defend itself against the threat of attack from the U.S. “It’s my personal opinion, but I think we’ll continue to conduct nuclear tests.”
