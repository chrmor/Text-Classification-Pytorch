Pakistan Police Guarding Polio Workers Are Attacked
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A gunman shot and killed one policeman and wounded another on Wednesday as they provided security for a team of polio eradication health workers in northwestern Pakistan, according to government officials.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Pakistani Taliban have repeatedly targeted health workers on anti-polio drives, accusing them of being spies. The violence has seriously hindered the immunization campaign in Pakistan, which is one of three countries in the world where polio remains endemic.
The resistance to polio vaccination by Taliban militants stiffened after the raid in May 2011 on Osama bin Laden’s compound in northern Pakistan, as revelations surfaced that the C.I.A. had used a Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, to run a vaccination campaign to help in efforts to locate Bin Laden.
Since then, Taliban insurgents have increased their attacks on the vaccination work and issued religious edicts that accuse the United States of using it to gather intelligence. Hard-line religious extremists also claim that the vaccinations aim to sterilize Muslims.
The latest attack took place in the afternoon in the Par Hoti neighborhood of the Mardan district in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. The policemen, Raj Wali and Mohammad Ishfaq, were accompanying two female workers on the second day of a three-day anti-polio drive, said Wajid Ali, a local police official.
The policemen were standing guard in the street as the health workers administered drops inside a house when an unidentified gunman, who appeared to be in his early 20s, walked up to them and opened fire. Mr. Wali was killed and Mr. Ishfaq was wounded, Mr. Ali said in a telephone interview. The gunman escaped.
The shooting was widely condemned, and officials said the vaccination campaign would continue despite militant threats and intimidation.
