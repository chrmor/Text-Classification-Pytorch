Cristiano Ronaldo named Ibero-American Athlete of the Year
Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo added another piece of silverware to his collection when he was named the greatest Ibero-American athlete of last year.
Ronaldo, widely tipped to finish runner-up to Lionel Messi again in the race for the Ballon d'Or, was presented with the massive trophy during a presentation at the Royal Palace of El Pardo.
He said: 'It was an honour for me to receive such a beautiful trophy from Her Majesty the Queen of Spain.
'Once again, as with all the awards I've received, I want to individually thank all those who chose me for this award, but especially my team-mates and coaches because without them this wouldn't have been possible.
'I want to dedicate this award especially to Real Madrid fans.'
Real president Florentino Perez, director of institutional relations Emilio Butragueno and honorary president Alfredo Di St√©fano accompanied Ronaldo to the ceremony.
The former Manchester United favourite helped his side to a 4-1 win over Ajax on Tuesday as they wound up their Champions League group stage in style.
