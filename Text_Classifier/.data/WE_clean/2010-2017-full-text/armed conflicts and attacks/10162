Bahraini activists fear for the life of a hunger striker who they say has gone without food for 55 days, a perilous attempt to draw attention to human rights abuses in the Persian Gulf nation.
Abdulhadi Khawaja is one of several opposition leaders sentenced to life in prison for taking part in an uprising that began last year against the Sunni Muslim monarchy, the Associated Press reported. Attorneys appealed the convictions of Khawaja and other opposition figures Monday.
In a February letter to Denmark's foreign minister, Khawaja said he had been severely beaten and tortured for months before being charged with trying to overthrow the state. That month he began a hunger strike, intermittently consuming only glucose and water, activists say.
Khawaja was hospitalized last week after his blood sugar plummeted, according to the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, where his daughter Maryam works. The group says Khawaja is giving up glucose, because Bahraini officials reportedly cited it as proof that he wasn’t really on a hunger strike.
“Al-Khawaja is at high risk of going into a coma at any time now due to his condition. If not released immediately it could be fatal,” his daughter wrote on Twitter.
