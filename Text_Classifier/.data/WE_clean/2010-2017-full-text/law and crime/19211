Kenyan presidential hopeful Quincy Timberlake charged with murder in Brisbane
A former Kenyan presidential hopeful has been charged with murder in Brisbane, following the death of a boy in June.
Quincy Zuma Wambitta Timberlake, 34, was arrested and charged on Tuesday morning.
He briefly faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court and was remanded in custody until his next court date on December 4.
Police have been investigating the three-year-old boy's death since June 18, when he was pronounced dead in Mr Timberlake's Kallangur home.
Mr Timberlake, a former Kenyan political activist who co-founded the Platinum Centraliser and Unionist Party, fled his home country with his wife to escape political persecution.
