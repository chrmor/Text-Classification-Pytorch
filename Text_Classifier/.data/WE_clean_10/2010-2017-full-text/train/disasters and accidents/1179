The death toll from flash floods in a remote region of eastern Indonesia has climbed to at least 97, with dozens of people still missing.
Rescue workers are still searching for survivors from floods which hit West Papua's Teluk Wondama district on Monday following torrential downpours.
"At least 97 people were killed and more than 800 people were lightly and badly injured," Papua search and rescue official Mochamad Arifin said.
"We are still searching for dozens of missing people."
Those killed had reportedly drowned and been swept away by the powerful waters along with uprooted trees, rocks and debris.
Experts warned such events will become more common in the archipelago due to a combination of climate change, land conversion and logging.
