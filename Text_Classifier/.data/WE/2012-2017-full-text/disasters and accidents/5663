A Navy SEAL was killed and another injured Thursday in a parachute-training accident in Arizona, the Pentagon said Friday.
The senior enlisted officer was pronounced dead at the University of Arizona Hospital. The injured SEAL was listed in stable condition.
The dead SEAL's name will not be released until 24 hours after his family has been notified, which is standard military policy.
Both officers were from an East Coast Naval Special Warfare Unit, the Associated Press said.
The SEALs were practicing "routine military free-fall training" at the U.S. Special Operations Command's facility at Pinal Airpark in Marana, northeast of Tucson, said spokesman Kenneth McGraw. Authorities told the AP they collided in midair.
Earlier this month, a military training accident in Nevada killed seven Marines when a mortar exploded inside a tube before launching.
