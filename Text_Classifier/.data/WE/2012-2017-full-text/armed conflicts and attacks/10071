U.N. Deploys Troops in Congo After Massacre
The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo on Sunday started deploying more troops in the troubled South Kivu province, a day after gunmen killed dozens of people, officials said Sunday.
Martin Kobler, the head of the peacekeeping mission known as Monusco, said the extra troops would bolster the national army's efforts to restore order in the region following the attack in which 30 locals were killed.
