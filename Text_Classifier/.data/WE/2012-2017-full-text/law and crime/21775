At around 6:30 p.m., the NYPD received numerous calls of shots fired in and around Penn Station, NYPD Chief of Manhattan South Bill Morris said in an evening news conference. Morris confirmed that the noise had come from the deployment of a Taser by Amtrak police: “There were no actual shots fired.”
The NYPD said the station was deemed safe again at 7:10 p.m.

Michael Clark, 37, was inside Penn Station when he heard what he described as a fizzling sound akin to a sparkler, followed by a “massive stampede.”
“This pack of people ran out to the street,” Clark said, adding that he and everyone around him abandoned their luggage in the station.
Sixteen people were injured as they tried to leave the station, FDNY Deputy Chief Tom Currao said during the news conference.
Erik McIntyre said he was waiting in the Amtrak area of Penn Station when a man bumped into him as he attempted to flee from Amtrak officers. The man pushed one of the officers and two more officers attempted to restrain him, according to McIntyre.
“He kept fighting back as the officers attempted to stop him,” McIntyre said in an emailed interview. “At one point they got pushed up against a pillar and that’s when the crowd noticed something was happening.”
The station was not evacuated and remains open, Amtrak said.
