Ready Steady Cook is axed by BBC
The cookery show 'Ready Steady Cook', which was hosted by Ainsley Harriot, has been axed by the BBC.
Liam Keelan, BBC's Head of Daytime, confirmed the news, saying: "After 15 years, 21 series and nearly 2,000 episodes, 'Ready Steady Cook' has hung up its cooking aprons."
"I'm proud of the show, which will go down in history as the longest running cookery show on TV."
"BBC Daytime is constantly looking at ways to innovate and refresh our programme formats and, while the series has been hugely popular on BBC2, it was felt that 'Ready Steady Cook' has been taken as far as it could."
Presenter Ainsley Harriot said: "I feel privileged to have been part of the 'Ready Steady Cook' family for the past 15 years."
"I am immensely proud of its success as the longest-running cookery show on British television and will always look back on it with the fondest of memories."
