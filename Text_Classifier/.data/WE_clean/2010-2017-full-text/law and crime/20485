Radio broadcaster killed in Tagbilaran
MANILA, Philippines – A Bohol-based radio broadcaster was killed on Saturday afternoon, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) confirmed.
The NUJP said Engr. Maurito Lim, who anchored the program “Chairman Mao On Board,” was shot by a gunman on a motorcycle as he alighted from his car. The shooting happened at around 10:35 a.m. in front of the dyRD radio station in Tagbilaran.
The 71-year-old Lim was reportedly hit on the left jaw, with the bullet exiting his right ear.
NUJP-Tagbilaran vice chairperson Leo Udtuhan said the victim was brought to the Governor Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital, which was across the radio station. He had undergone an operation but died at 1:15 p.m.
Udtuhan said Lim had been known for criticizing local officials allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade.
“Lim was the second journalist killed in Tagbilaran, the 172nd since 1986, and the 34th under President Benigno Aquino III,” Dabet Panelo, NUJP media safety coordinator, said in a statement.
A report by DZMM said that the police have secured a copy of the closed circuit television camera (CCTV) installed near the incident area and is now identifying the assailant.
