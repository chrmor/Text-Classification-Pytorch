Spartak sack Emery after derby thrashing
Spartak Moscow have sacked coach Unai Emery just six months after the Spaniard was put in charge of the Russian side.The former Valencia boss has not had the best of times at the capital club, who currently sit in sixth place in the Premier League after 17 games, outside the European places.They suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Barcelona in midweek, leaving them in fourth place in their Champions League group and eliminated from European competition. That was followed up with a crushing 5-1 loss to local rivals Dinamo Moscow on Sunday, and general director Valery Karpin confirmed Emery's dismissal at the post-match press conference."I have one announcement. It has been decided by shareholders of the club that Emery will no longer coach Spartak," he revealed."What happens next will all be announced tomorrow [Monday] or the day after."However, when questioned on whether he would take control of the team once more, Karpin simply replied: "No idea."
