Airstrike on missile base in Yemen capital causes huge explosion: residents
Saudi-led airstrikes on weapons caches in Yemen's rebel-held capital Monday caused massive explosions that shattered windows, sent residents scrambling for shelter and killed a local TV presenter. A TV station run by the rebels in Sanaa said 15 people were killed and dozens wounded in the bombing but those figures could not immediately be confirmed. The explosions were the most powerful seen in the city since a Saudi-led air campaign against Iran-allied Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, began last month. Saudi Arabia and several of its allies, mainly Gulf Arab countries, launched the airstrikes on March 26, hoping to roll back the rebels, who seized Sanaa in September and have overrun large parts of the country with the help of security forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Security Council resolution makes no mention of the Saudi-led airstrikes but imposes an arms embargo on three leaders of the Shiite rebel group, as well as on Saleh and his son.
