Imam marries 14-year-old girl to 'husband' 20 years older
A former Imam who marrieda teenage girl to a man more than twice her age has been spared jail despite being found guilty.
The once revered cleric Ibrahim Omerdic was suspended from his position at Bosnian Islamic Society and Noble Park Mosque in Melbourne, Australia following his arrest.
He had presided over the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to a man aged 34, telling her she must obey her new husband.
Video footage from the ceremony sees Mr Omerdic say: "If [your husband] is happy with something, do it. If [your husband] is not happy with something, don't do it."
The 62-year-old was arrested after the wedding, which took place in September last year, and pleaded not guilty to the charge of unlawfully solemnising the marriage.
He was sentenced to two months' prison on Wednesday, but immediately placed on a two-year recognisance release order, meaning he won't serve time in jail.
ProsecutorKrista Breckweg said the celebrant should be jailed in order to deter future child weddings.
She said: "This offending involved a man marrying a child to an older man, knowingly.
"There needs to be a message sent to the community that this will not be tolerated."
But Mr Omerdic's defence lawyer, Daniel Gurvich, said this was not a "per-meditated" offence.
Mr Gurvich added: "There was a degree of spontaneity, poor judgement and regret."
At sentencing magistrate Phillip Goldberg said: "You performed a marriage between a high school student and an older man.
"Whatever the view is elsewhere, in Australia marriage is between adults."
