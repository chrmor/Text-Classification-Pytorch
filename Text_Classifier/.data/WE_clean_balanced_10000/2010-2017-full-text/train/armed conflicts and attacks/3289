Mexican drug lord Moreno gunned down
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Suspected drug lord Nazario Moreno was gunned down late on Thursday by security forces amid an ongoing crackdown in western Mexico, Mexican national security spokesman Alejandro Poire said on Friday.
Moreno, known as “The Craziest One,” was one of the leaders of the cult-like La Familia (The Family) drug cartel dominant in President Felipe Calderon’s home state of Michoacan.
