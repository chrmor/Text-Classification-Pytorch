Tamil Nadu's Sivakasi factory fire: Sivakasi factory fire: 54 charred to death in the incident
SIVAKASI In one of the worst fire tragedies in Tamil Nadu , 54 persons were charred to death and 50 others injured today when a devastating blaze swept through a cracker factory complex at nearby Mudhalipatti. The factory and 48 sheds in the complex exploded in flames as the fire broke out when workers were mixing chemicals to make fancy fire crackers, trapping many in the inferno, police and fire brigade said. The dead bodies were accounted for by doctors at Sivakasi (25), Virudhunagar (15), Sattur (13) and Madurai (1). Explosions could be heard across more than two square km in the sleepy village as thick plumes of smoke engulfed the area with bodies burnt beyond recognition and scores of injured lay all round presenting a sight of a battle zone. Almost all those killed were workers, with some persons who rushed inside the Omshakthi factory complex to try and rescue those trapped inside also falling victim to the blaze, police said. All the victims suffered more than 80 per cent burns. The entire production had been stored in a godown against official advice, they said. Fire fighters handicapped by lack of proper equipment, including masks, to tackle such major fires had to battle for four hours to douse the raging flames after struggling to enter the complex with thick smoke hampering their efforts. Officials said all the victims who perished in the fire had suffered more than 80 per cent burns. The task was now to protect sheds where crackers had been stored in nearby areas, they said. An angry mob in the area tried to enter the factory premises but were prevented by the police who sealed the area. Senior minister O Panneerselvam and four other colleagues have rushed to the spot to oversee relief operations. Officials attributed the delay in dousing fire to the lack of enough equipment for fire fighters, including mask.
