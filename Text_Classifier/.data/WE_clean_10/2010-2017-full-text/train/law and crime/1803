Vienna - A man drove his van on Saturday into a crowd in Graz, Austria's second largest city, and local media reported three people dead and about 50 others injured.
Police confirmed the incident, but would not give any details or confirm the number of dead and injured persons.
Public broadcaster ORF said the man had been arrested and that police had sealed off the downtown area where the incident occurred.
It cited unnamed witnesses as saying the man apparently ploughed his vehicle into the crowd at random, sending several people crashing into the windshield and flying over the van.
