Two dead, 19 feared drowned as boat carrying illegals capsizes
JOHOR BARU: Two people died and 19 others are feared drowned after a boat with 80 Indonesian illegal immigrants reportedly capsized off Tanjung Piai near Pontian early today.
The dead, a man and a woman, were among 61 people pulled out of the water by fire and rescue personnel, said Johor assistant director of fire and rescue operations Mohd Rizal Buang.
Ten others were injured and sent to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital, he said, adding that the 49 others were safe.
Mohd Rizal said 20 fire and rescue personnel searched for the remaining passengers of the boat after the fire and rescue service was alerted at 1.33am of the boat mishap which occurred three nautical miles off Tanjung Piai.
In a latest development, a massive search – jointly mounted by the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), Fire and Rescue Department, Civil Defence Department and Marine Department – is underway in a six square nautical mile area between Tanjung Pelepas and Tanjung Piai.
"The Fire and Rescue Department has been assigned an area about two nautical miles off Tanjung Pelepas. We are waiting for the low tide at 4.30pm to deploy five boats until 7pm," he said.
The boat had collided with a vessel of the Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency that was engaged in an "Ops Tumpas" operation, he said. – Bernama
