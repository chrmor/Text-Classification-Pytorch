FDA Bans Artificial Trans Fats in United States Food Supply
We previously reported that the Food and Drug Administration might ban artificial trans fats in the United States, and now this ban will be implemented in the country’s food supply, according to the FDA. Companies will have three years to remove all trans fats from their food and beverage supplies.
The decision came Tuesday morning, when the FDA deemed that partially hydrogenated oils are not “generally recognized as safe” for human consumption. Dr. Stephen Ostroff, acting commissioner of the FDA, hopes that this move will improve the health and well-being of Americans. “This action is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year,” he stated.
Companies must now reformulate their food supplies to be approved by the FDA. The effort to rid trans fats began in 2006, when manufacturers were first required to list trans fats content. It looks like these trans fat-laden foods will receive a recipe revamp ASAP.
