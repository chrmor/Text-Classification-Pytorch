Greece debt crisis: Yanis Varoufakis stands down as finance minister
Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has announced he will leave the Ministry in a blog post titled 'Minister No More!' on Monday afternoon, saying his presence would hamper aid talks.
The news comes after Greece's historic 'no' vote in the referendum to accept a bail-out from Europe on Sunday evening,
"Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted 'partners', for my… 'absence' from its meetings; an idea that the Prime Minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement," he wrote.
"For this reason I am leaving the Ministry of Finance today."
