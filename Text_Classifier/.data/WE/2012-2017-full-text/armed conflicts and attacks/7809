Gunfire Wounds Israeli Girl, 9, Playing in Yard in West Bank
JERUSALEM — A 9-year-old girl was shot in the chest Saturday night while playing outside her home in a West Bank settlement, in what the Israeli authorities suspect was an attack by a Palestinian who had broken into the settlement from one of the surrounding villages. The girl was in stable condition at a Jerusalem hospital, officials said.
Libby Weiss, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces, said the shooting in Psagot, near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, was “being investigated as a possible terrorist attack.”
Israeli news Web sites reported that a hole had been found in the fence surrounding Psagot, a community of 2,000 residents known for its winery, and that the girl had told a medic that she saw the assailant enter her yard.
Several right-wing Israeli politicians who oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state seized on the shooting to call for a halt in the Washington-brokered peace negotiations.
“We’ve returned to a situation in which talks with the Palestinians equal murderous terrorist attacks,” Uri Ariel, Israel’s housing minister, said in a statement. “This situation cannot be allowed to continue.”
