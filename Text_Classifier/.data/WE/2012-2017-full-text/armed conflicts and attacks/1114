U.S., Afghanistan Agree on Night Raids
KABULâ€”Afghanistan and the U.S. on Sunday signed a breakthrough deal giving the Afghan government greater oversight of controversial night raids, setting the stage for sealing a long-term partnership agreement next month.
After months of difficult talks, the two nations agreed to give Afghan judges more power to regulate the raids, curtail U.S. military searches of Afghan homes and restrict the ability of American forces to directly interrogate detainees.
