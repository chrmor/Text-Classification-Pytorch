Hurricane Nicole strengthened to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph on Wednesday night and continued northward on a path that could take it to Bermuda's doorstep by tomorrow.
A hurricane warning was in effect for the island, where Nicole could make its presence felt starting tonight.
The National Hurricane Center noted Wednesday night the significance of Nicole's path toward Bermuda. "Note that while hurricanes often affect Bermuda, a hurricane this strong is rare," forecasters wrote in their 10 p.m. discussion. "There have only been seven major hurricanes that have passed within 40 (nautical miles) of Bermuda in the Atlantic hurricane database, which goes back to 1851."
As of the last advisory, at 10 p.m. CDT Wednesday, Hurricane Nicole was located about 180 miles south-southwest of Bermuda and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph, according to the hurricane center.
Forecasters expected Nicole to turn more to the northeast and speed up by Thursday. On that path, the eye of Nicole will pass over or very close to Bermuda, the hurricane center said.
Bermuda could be battered even if Nicole doesn't make landfall: Hurricane force winds extend outward about 65 miles from Nicole's large eye, the hurricane center said. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 160 miles as well.
In addition to its 130 mph winds, Nicole could bring a "dangerous" storm surge of 6-8 feet and coastal flooding to Bermuda, forecasters said.
Four to 8 inches of rain will also be possible through Thursday.
The hurricane center said isolated tornadoes will also be a risk tonight and early Thursday.
