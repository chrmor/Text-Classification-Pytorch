US official held in Pakistan 'is CIA'
Raymond Davis, a US contractor, has been held for more than a fortnight accused of murder after admitting shooting dead two men in Lahore in self defence.
Despite the incident, the US has insisted he is entitled to diplomatic immunity, arguing that he is an "administrative and technical official" linked to its Lahore consulate.
Pakistan intelligence officials however believe that Davis, a former special forces soldier, is employed by the CIA.
"It's beyond a shadow of a doubt," one official told the Guardian.
Rana Sanaullah, the Punjab law minister, told the newspaper: "This is not the work of a diplomat. He was doing espionage and surveillance activities,"
The allegations came as a US drone attack on Sunday killed at least five militants in South Waziristan, the first such attack since Davis' arrest on January 27.
