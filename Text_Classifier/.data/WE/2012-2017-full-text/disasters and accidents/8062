Mumbai: At least four people were killed and eight others injured when a massive fire engulfed a 7-storey building in Mumbai`s Vikhroli area early on Monday. According to reports, full efforts are on to contain the fire, which has engulfed the entire building. The fire, according to officials, was noticed around 3 am and could have started in the electric meter cable box and spread through the network of cables from there.
Those injured in the incident have been admitted to Rajawadi and Sion hospital in Mumbai.
The residents have blamed the builder for having no emergency exits in the structure. "There was no safety plan in case of a building fire. Every resident`s life is in danger," a resident said. This is the third incident of fire in the same building.
"The President, Secretary and the Treasurer of our society all collude with the builder. He has a nexus with the local politicians too who helped him construct this building," a resident said.
