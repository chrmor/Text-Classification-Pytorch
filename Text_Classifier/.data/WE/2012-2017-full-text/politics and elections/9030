Botswana Dumps North after Damning COI Report- Daily NK
The government of Botswana has terminated diplomatic and consular relations with North Korea, it has been revealed. The decision to end links with Pyongyang comes after this week��s publication of the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights abuses by the North Korean authorities.
A brief statement published on the website of Botswana��s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation explained, ��[Botswana] wishes to announce that it has decided to terminate, with immediate effect, diplomatic and consular relations with the Democratic People��s Republic of Korea (North Korea).��
The statement adds that the decision was ��informed by the recently released report of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea which details systematic, widespread and grave human rights violations by North Korean authorities,�� noting, ��The Government of Botswana does not wish to be associated with a Government which continues to display such total disregard for the human rights of its citizens.��
It goes on to harshly criticize the authorities in Pyongyang, pointing out that any government is obliged to take responsibility for the welfare of its people and their human rights, but asserts that this has ��been seriously lacking in that country�� for many years.
In a particularly scathing final sentence, the statement concludes: ��Botswana wishes to convey its heartfelt sympathies to the people of North Korea who are currently subjected to inhuman treatment under the leadership of Kim Jong Eun.��
The Republic of Botswana is among the most prosperous states of Southern Africa, and home to one of the region��s most entrenched multi-party democracies.
Commenting on the decision by the government of Botswana, a North Korea expert told Daily NK this morning, ��The UN COI report designated North Korea��s human rights abuses as a crime against humanity, something which has no small degree of international significance. The South Korean media and people may underplay this decision by Botswana, but it has meaning.��
