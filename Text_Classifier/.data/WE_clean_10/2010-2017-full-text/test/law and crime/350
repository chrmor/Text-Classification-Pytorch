3 charged with several crimes in Flint water crisis
Michigan's attorney general says two state employees and a Flint utility worker charged in the Flint lead-tainted water crisis "failed Michigan families."
An investigation led by the office of Bill Schuette (SHOOT'-ee) began in January.
Two state employees and a Flint utility worker were charged Wednesday with several crimes.
Schuette also said at a news conference Wednesday that he'd "guarantee" there will be more charges.
For nearly 18 months after Flint's water source was switched while the city was under state financial management, residents drank and bathed with improperly treated water that coursed through aging pipes and fixtures, releasing toxic lead. Blood tests have revealed high lead levels in children.
