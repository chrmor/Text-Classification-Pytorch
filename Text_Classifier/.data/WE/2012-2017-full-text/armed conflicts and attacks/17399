Al-Shabab attack in Somali capital Mogadishu kills five
At least five people have been killed and seven wounded after a suicide bomb attack on a restaurant near a local government building in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
The attacker drove a car packed with explosives outside the busy restaurant, a spokesman from the mayor's office told the BBC.
Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it was behind the attack.
The group, an al-Qaeda affiliate, is waging an armed insurgency in Somalia.
Al-Shabab frequently carries out attacks in the Somali capital.
The government, with the help of African Union forces, is fighting al-Shabab to regain control of the country.
The militants pulled out of Mogadishu in 2011.
