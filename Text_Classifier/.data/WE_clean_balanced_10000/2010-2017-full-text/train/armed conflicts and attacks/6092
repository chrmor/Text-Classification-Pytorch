Twin bombs hit hotel in Somalia capital Mogadishu :: Kenya
Mogadishu, Somalia: Two car bombs have exploded outside a hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu, with reports of casualties.
The explosions occurred at the Jazeera hotel is near Mogadishu's airport and is popular with Somali politicians.
Reports say the blasts were followed by exchanges of fire between security forces and the attackers.
The Somali Islamist militant group Al Shabab was driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 but has continued to launch attacks on the capital.
The al-Qaeda-linked group still controls many southern and central areas of the country.
Last week at least 11 people, including six soldiers, were killed by a remote-controlled bomb in a restaurant in Mogadishu.
