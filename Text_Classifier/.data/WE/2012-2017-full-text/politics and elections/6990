Celebrations as Croatia becomes 28th member of the European Union
Croatia has become the 28th member of the European Union.
Crowds flocked to the central square in the capital Zagreb to mark the historic moment with speeches and the EU anthem, Beethoven's Ode To Joy.
EU officials say it is a remarkable moment for a country which only 20 years ago was in the middle of a brutal war of independence from the former Yugoslavia.
Two-thirds of Croatians voted to join the European Union, but some of the country's 4.5 million citizens question the wisdom of joining a bloc struggling to deal with such significant economic troubles of its own.
One in five Croatians are unemployed, and the country is facing its fifth year in recession.
Prime minister Zoran Milanovic earlier dismissed fears that Croatia would be an economic burden on the bloc.
"Why would we be a problem? After we negotiated for years (with Brussels) every detail... we have a stable political system, we have an economic crisis like every one else, we have a relatively stable banking system," he said.
"At the end of the day we are not a part of the eurozone," he added, referring to the crisis-ridden single currency bloc.
Mr Milanovic's centre-left government hopes that EU entry will attract badly needed foreign investment and boost the economy with 11.7 billion euros ($16 billion) of potential financial aid.
The country's per capita gross domestic product is 39 per cent below the EU average, with only Romania and Bulgaria lagging behind.
Zagreb has aspired to join the EU club since it proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslavia, a move that sparked the bloody 1991-95 war against rebel Serbs backed by Belgrade.
Croatia is the first new member since Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007.
In addition to agreeing to open accession talks with Serbia on Friday, EU leaders also gave the green light last week to preliminary discussions with Kosovo, the first step on the long path to Brussels.
