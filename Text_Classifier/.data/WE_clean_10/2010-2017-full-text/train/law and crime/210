Arrests Made in Diamond Heist
BRUSSELSâ€”Three months after masked robbers stole more than $50 million in diamonds from the belly of a plane about to leave Brussels Airport, police in France, Switzerland and Belgium detained more than two dozen people and confiscated a "significant" stash of diamonds and cash.
The sweep began Tuesday when one person was arrested in France and eight others were brought in for questioning in Switzerland, according to Swiss and Belgian authorities.
