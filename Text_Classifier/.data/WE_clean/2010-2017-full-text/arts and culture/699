Michael Douglas To Undergo Treatment For Throat Tumor
'I am very optimistic,' Douglas says in a statement.
Michael Douglas is set to begin chemotherapy after doctors recently discovered a tumor in his throat.
People magazine reports that the "Wall Street" actor's doctors expect Douglas to make a full recovery as soon as he completes eight weeks of treatment, which will reportedly include a combination of radiation and chemotherapy.
"I am very optimistic," Douglas said in a statement to the magazine.
No word yet on how the treatment will affect his work schedule, as Douglas has a lot on his plate, including promotion for his return to the character Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps," which opens at the end of September.
Douglas is also set to appear alongside a slew of stars in Steven Soderbergh's upcoming action thriller "Knockout." The cast includes Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas and Bill Paxton.
When MTV News last caught up with the 65-year-old actor, he appeared happy and healthy at the Film Society of Lincoln Center Honors, where he received the year's top honor, presented to Hollywood legends.
At the time, Douglas was hard-pressed to pick his favorite role from his four-decade-long career in the business. "You work as hard on your failures as on your successes," he said. "I'd say tonight, particularly because [director] Curtis [Hanson] is here, I liked 'Wonder Boys' a lot. 'Solitary Man' is right up there. I'm real happy with my batting average. I look at the rest, and it's pretty good. You pick your spots."
