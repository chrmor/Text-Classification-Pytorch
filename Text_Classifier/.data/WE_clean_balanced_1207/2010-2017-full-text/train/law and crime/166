Peruvian Prosecutor Seeks to Put Lori Berenson Back in Jail
Peru’s top anti-terrorism prosecutor is expected to ask a court today to revoke the parole of American activist Lori Berenson and send her back to prison to finish her twenty-year sentence. Berenson was freed on parole in May after nearly fifteen years behind bars. Berenson has kept a low profile since she was freed but is expected to speak during today’s hearing in the court to make her case for upholding her parole.
