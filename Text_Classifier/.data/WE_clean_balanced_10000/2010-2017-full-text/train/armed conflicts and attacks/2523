Top pro-Kurdish lawyer shot dead in Turkey's southeast
The head of the Diyarbakir Bar Association was shot dead in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir in the clearest sign of a deteriorating security situation in the country's southeast since elections this month.
Tahir Elci, 49, was killed this morning in clashes that broke out between security forces and militants during a press conference where he was speaking, according to Minister of Interior Efkan Ala. Both the Diyarbakir Bar and Pro-Kurdish HDP party called the killing an assassination.
One police officer was killed and three others wounded in the attack, state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Turkey declared a curfew in Diyarbakir's Sur district after the clashes broke out, according to Hurriyet newspaper.
The killing is the latest sign of the precarious security situation in Turkey's southeast after peace talks collapsed between the government and the PKK, which seeks autonomy for the country's ethnic Kurds. The Ak Party's landslide victory on November ended months of political deadlock.
