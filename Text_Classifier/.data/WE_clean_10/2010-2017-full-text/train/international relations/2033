The Federal Government says it is hoping to resolve a dispute that is threatening a planned survey of Gallilopi battlefields in Turkey.
Turkey's ambassador to Australia and New Zealand is refusing to issue visas to archaeologists from the two countries.
He has told Radio New Zealand he is unhappy with a World War I monument built in Sydney which commemorates the deaths of around 750,000 Assyrians.
The monument, erected by Assyrian community leaders, refers to the alleged killing of the Assyrians by Ottoman troops as "genocide".
Oguz Ozge, Turkey's ambassador to Australia and New Zealand, says the monument is "quite unacceptable."
"This is quite concerning to the Turkish government and as long as remedial action is not taken we intend to do something on the part of the Turkish government," he said.
Archaeologists from Turkey, New Zealand and Australia are next week due to begin mapping the Gallipoli peninsula.
A final decision to suspend the Gallipoli survey has not yet been taken, but Mr Ozge said it "could be, until we find a way out".
A Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman says discussions are currently taking place between the Department and the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs to sort out the issue of the delayed visas.
Vandals have attacked the monument, spray-painting it with the words, "Assyrian dogs", and the Turkish flag.
