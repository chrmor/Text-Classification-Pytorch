Obama touts leaner US military
President Barack Obama has unveiled a strategy for a leaner US military focused on countering China's rising power while signalling a shift away from large ground wars against insurgents.
The plan calls for preparing for possible challenges from Iran and China with air and naval power while downplaying any future massive counter-insurgency campaigns like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The "defence strategic review" sets out an approach for the US military in an era of austerity, as Obama's administration prepares for $US487 billion ($A471 billion) in defence cuts over the next 10 years.
But Obama, anticipating attacks from his Republican rivals in an election year, said defence reductions would be limited and not come at the expense of America's military might.
"So yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know - the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats," Obama told reporters at an unusual appearance at the Pentagon on Thursday.
