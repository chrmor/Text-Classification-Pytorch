Police Shooting Kills Crew Member Working for TV Show ‘Cops’
OMAHA — The Omaha police chief said Wednesday that the fatal shooting of a crew member filming the television show “Cops” by one of his officers was an “unfortunate incident” and that it appeared that the three officers involved had acted professionally.
Police officers responded to a report of a robbery at a Wendy’s restaurant in Omaha on Tuesday night with two crew members from the reality television show riding in the back seat of their patrol car for a night of filming. After a standoff with a suspect inside the fast-food restaurant, both the robbery suspect and a sound supervisor for the show, Bryce Dion, were killed by police gunfire.
Officials said that Mr. Dion, 38, was accidentally shot when officers opened fire on the robbery suspect, who they believed had fired at them. The officers later found that the suspect, Cortez Washington, 32, had shot a pellet gun, not a real firearm, the Omaha police said.
“I can tell you that nobody wanted Bryce to get hurt. Nobody wanted anybody to get hurt,” Chief Todd Schmaderer said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. “Police work is very dangerous and very chaotic. When you’re reporting police work and riding along with us, unfortunately, you subject yourself to that same level of violence that Omaha police officers do every day.”
