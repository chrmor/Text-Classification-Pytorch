23 terrorist suspects arrested, 11 killed in 'Operation Eagle': Defence ministry
The Egyptian armed forces have arrested 23 suspected terrorists and killed 11 in the Sinai Peninsula during an operation to restore calm in the region following a terrorist attack that killed 16 Egyptian border guards on 5 August, a military official revealed in a statement on Egyptian TV early Wednesday morning.
During Operation Eagle the armed forces have confiscated a large amount of ammunition, including four machine guns, five boxes of Israeli ammunition, six hand grenades, five anti-tank mines and a BM-21 launch vehicle, according to the statement. Troops will be redeployed throughout Sinai to restore security in the area, the statement concluded. Operation Eagle began on 7 August, two days after 16 border guards were killed by unidentified assailants in an incident that laid bare the deteriorating security situation in the Sinai Peninsula since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak.
The operation, which was originally aimed at securing vital establishments in the Sinai Peninsula, became a combat engagement with militants that will continue until "all terrorist and criminal activity is quashed."
