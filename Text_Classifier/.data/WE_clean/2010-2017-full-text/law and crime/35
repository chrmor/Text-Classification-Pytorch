Iranian police killed in drugs shoot-out
At least seven Iranian police officers have died in a clash with drugs smugglers in the east of the country, officials said.
The shoot-out happened in Khorasan province near the Afghan border, a police chief told Iranian state radio.
The report said four drugs traffickers had also been killed and another seriously wounded.
The region lies on a major narcotics route from neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"In a clash between the police and drug smugglers... four of them [drug smugglers] were killed and another wounded," said provincial police chief Gen Hamid Sharafi.
"Smugglers and armed bandits also left several vehicles, motorbikes and their arms fleeing the scene."
Gen Sharafi said two tonnes of drugs had been confiscated.
Funerals for the seven policemen had been arranged, he added.
Another report, by the official Irna news agency, said four more policemen wounded in the clash later died of their injuries.
