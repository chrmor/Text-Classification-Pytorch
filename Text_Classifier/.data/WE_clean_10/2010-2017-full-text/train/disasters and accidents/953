One Canadian confirmed dead in Japan quake
The Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that one Canadian was killed in Friday's devastating earthquake in Japan.
"Out of respect for the family's privacy and in accordance with the Privacy Act, we cannot release any further details," department spokesperson Priya Sinha said in an email statement.
The government says that 1,773 Canadian citizens are registered with the Canadian embassy in Japan, but it is estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 Canadians are in the country.
Thirteen Canadians were registered as living in the area hardest hit by Friday's quake and ensuing tsunami, a Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said.
The official death toll reached 687 late Saturday, but officials predicted that number may jump to well over 1,000 after search and rescue crews reach the most devastated areas.
On Friday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper extended his "heartfelt condolences" to the people of Japan, sending the thoughts and prayers of Canadians "to all those who have been affected by this terrible earthquake and tsunami."
Foreign Affairs says Canadians in need of emergency consular assistance in Japan should contact the embassy in Tokyo at 011-81-3-5412-6200, or can call the department's emergency operations centre collect to 613-944-2471 or 613-943-1055. Emails can also be sent to sos@international.gc.ca.
Anyone seeking information about Canadian friends of family now in Japan is asked to call DFAIT at 613-943-1055, or toll free within Canada at 1-800-606-5499 or 1-800-387-3124.
