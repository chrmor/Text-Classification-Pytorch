French former minister Georges Tron held over sex case
French police have detained former minister Georges Tron over sex charges, the local prosecutor's office has said.
Mr Tron resigned as junior civil service minister last month after being accused of sexually assaulting two women who worked in the town hall where he is mayor.
He was arrested on Monday for questioning, as part of prosecutors' preliminary inquiries.
He has not been charged in the case, and denies the accusations.
Police can hold Mr Tron for 24 hours and extend his arrest for another 24 hours, said prosecutor Marie-Suzanne Le Queau.
One of his deputies at the Draveil town hall is also being held.
A third accuser has also "recently brought charges" against Mr Tron, according to sources close to the investigation. Her identity or connection to Mr Tron is not known.
The first two accusers allege Mr Tron gave them reflexology foot massages which turned into forced sexual encounters.
Mr Tron resigned from the government at the end of last month over the allegations, a few days after ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York on sex crime charges. He remains mayor of Draveil.
At the time of his resignation, Ms Le Queau said that "if the facts alleged were established, they could come under the headings of sexual aggression and rape".
