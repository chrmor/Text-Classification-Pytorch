Foreign medical workers among 10 killed in Afghanistan
Eight foreigners and two Afghans found shot dead next to abandoned vehicles are likely to be an eye care team from the International Assistance Mission's, executive director Dirk Frans has said.
Their vehicles were discovered a day after contact was lost with them. Local police said robbery might have been the motive. However, the Taliban have said they were behind the attack.
