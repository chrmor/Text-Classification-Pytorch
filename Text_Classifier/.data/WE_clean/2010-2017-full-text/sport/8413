Marcos Ambrose claims maiden NASCAR win
Six tough years after leaving his homeland and the V8 Supercar series he dominated, Marcos Ambrose is cherishing a dream come true.
Ambrose put memories of last year's near-miss blunder behind him as he snatched victory and became the first Australian to win a top-division NASCAR race on Monday.
In his 105th drive in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series Ambrose secured his thrilling win by snaking past last week's race winner Brad Keselowski on the penultimate lap of a crash-marred race on the road course at Watkins Glen International in New York.
A handful of Australian drivers have raced in the series - regarded as the world's pre-eminent stock car racing championship - including Allan Grice and Dick Johnson in the late 1980s.
But it's 35-year-old Launceston-born Ambrose who's celebrating the long-sought breakthrough, three weeks after Cadel Evans' history-making Tour de France cycling triumph.
Like Evans, Ambrose left Australia in pursuit of his dream, though he could have continued a lucrative and comfortable career in the V8 Supercar series he won in 2003 and 2004.
