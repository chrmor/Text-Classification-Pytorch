Anti-Chinese rioters on rampage in Vietnam
Bangkok: Anti-Chinese rioters have torched and looted about 10 factories in southern Vietnam in the most serious outbreak of public disorder in the tightly-controlled country in years.
Up to 20,000 people have been protesting over Chinaâ€™s deployment of an oil rig in waters of the South China Sea that Vietnam claims as its own.
Associated Press reports the rioters attacked factories in a Singapore-run industrial park they believed to be Chinese but which were mainly Taiwanese-owned.
Analysts say the communist government in Hanoi gave rare sanction to street protests as a way of amplifying its anger at Beijing over the oil rig that arrived on May 1 close to the Paracel islands.
