Egypt protesters say detained 120 police, loyalists
The organizers of a protest against Egypt's government said they had detained 120 people carrying identities associating them with either the police or the ruling party, most of them caught while attacking the demonstrators.
Kamal Ismail, an official in a committee organizing the protests, showed a Reuters journalist two identity cards confiscated on Thursday from men he said had tried to infiltrate the protest camp. One of them belonged to a police officer. (Reuters)
