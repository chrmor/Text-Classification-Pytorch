Australian among 12 killed in Papua New Guinea plane crash
An Australian is among 12 people who were killed when a light plane crashed as it tried to land in Papua New Guinea's Western Province, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says.
The Britten Norman-Islander plane crashed into a swamp just short of the airport runway at Kiunga in central PNG on Wednesday afternoon.
Kiunga police said three people were taken from the wreckage to Kiunga hospital, but were pronounced dead on arrival.
"A small plane that arrived from Oksapmin just before landing crashed into the swamp, with all the passengers, including the pilot, dead."
Local media reported engine failure on the Sunbird Aviation aircraft caused the crash.
Police said the plane was being flown by an expatriate pilot, but were unable to confirm reports he was an Australian.
A DFAT spokesperson said: "The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian man who was on board a Sunbird Aviation aircraft travelling from Oksapmin to Kiunga in Western Province, Papua New Guinea that crashed on approach to the airport at Kiunga.
"We continue to work closely with Papua New Guinea authorities.
"Our thoughts are with the passengers and crew of the aircraft and their families."
