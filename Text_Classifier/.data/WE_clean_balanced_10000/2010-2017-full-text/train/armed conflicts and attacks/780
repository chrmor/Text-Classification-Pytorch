The Syrian chargé d'affaires, Khaled al-Ayoubi, has informed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office today that he has left his post in the Syrian embassy in London.

It illustrates the revulsion and despair the regime's actions are provoking amongst Syrians from all walks of life, inside the country and abroad.Al-Ayoubi joined the Syrian diplomatic service in 2001. His first posting was in Greece as consul from 2003 to 2008.disassociate themselves from the crimes being committed against the Syrian people and to support a peaceful and free future for Syria.
