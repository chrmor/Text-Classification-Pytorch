Official: Charlie Sheen Settles Lawsuit With Warner Bros., Chuck Lorre
One of the most heated and high-stakes Hollywood legal battles is coming to a close. Charlie Sheen, Warner Bros. and Two and a Half Men co-creator Chuck Lorre are settling their $100 million legal dispute. 
The studio issued the following statement on Monday:
“Warner Bros. Television, Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen have resolved their dispute to the parties’ mutual satisfaction.  The pending lawsuit and arbitration will be dismissed as to all parties.  The parties have agreed to maintain confidentiality over the terms of the settlement.”
rom last week on thesettlement. None of the legal teams is commenting, but sources say the $25 million figure floated last week is pretty close to accurate. That dollar amount includes a reinstatement of the revenue stream from past episodes of Two and a Half Men (even those filmed before his media meltdown) that WB had denied Sheen after he filed the lawsuit.
Sources also say that Lorre will pay nothing as part of the settlement. And Sheen has agreed to refrain from disparaging his former boss in the media. The actor has been on an apology tour of late, culminating in his subdued appearance at the Emmys last Sunday. The mea culpa tour has coincided with Sheen's effort to sell his Lionsgate-produced sitcom comeback Anger Management, which is currently being shopped to buyers by distributor Debmar Mercury. 
An interesting footnote to the settlement is that TNT and TBS, sister companies of Warner Bros. Television, might now be allowed to bid on Anger Management. Time Warner had instituted a no-Sheen policy while the litigation was proceeding.
