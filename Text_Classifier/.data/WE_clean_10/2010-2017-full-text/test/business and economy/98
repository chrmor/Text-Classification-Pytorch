Cameron confirms G8 summit for Fermanagh
David Cameron has confirmed that next year’s G8 summit of world leaders will be held in Co Fermanagh in the North.
The British Prime Minister made the announcement during a visit to a factory in Co Armagh today.
The five-star Lough Erne hotel and golf resort will be the venue for next June’s meeting of the leaders of the world’s eight richest nations.
“I want the world to see just what a fantastic place Northern Ireland is,” Mr Cameron said.
Mr Cameron confirmed the venue during one of his PM Direct town hall-style question-and-answer sessions with the Co Armagh factory workers.
There had been mounting speculation that the administration-hit luxury resort on the outskirts of Enniskillen would host the conference.
It will be one of the most high-profile events ever witnessed in the North.
Barack Obama will be among those heading for Fermanagh but it will not be the first time a US President has been a guest in the county.
Bill Clinton has visited Enniskillen on a number of occasions and a community centre in the town bears his name.
