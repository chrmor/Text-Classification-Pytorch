Justice Jillani takes oath as new chief justice
Says he will take notice of footag­e of Justic­e Chaudh­ry’s retire­ment refere­nce being leaked to one media group.
ISLAMABAD: Justice Tasadduq Hussain Jilani took oath as the new Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) on Thursday, Express News reported.
He will remain in the role of chief justice for six months and 24 days after which Justice Nasirul Mulk will take his place.
Justice Jillani, as his first act as chief justice, said he will take notice of the footage of Justice Chaudhry’s retirement reference being leaked to one media group on December 11. Media was not allowed inside the court during the full court reference held yesterday.
He has also heard seven cases in the court after the oath taking ceremony. The first case he heard pertained to the allotment of plots by the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
President Mamnoon Hussain, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and former chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Chaudhry were among those present at the oath taking ceremony.
The new CJP was working as the acting chief election commissioner and had recently resigned from the post. 
He is nicknamed “the gentleman judge” for his mild manner and is expected to maintain the court’s focus on rights but steer clear of intervening in government policy.
A dapper lover of poetry, antiques and films, Jillani is related to the new ambassador to the United States Jalil Abbas Jilani and a former prime minister who Chaudhry forced to step down last year.
