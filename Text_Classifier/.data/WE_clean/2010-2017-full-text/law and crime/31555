5 Transgender Service Members Sue Trump Over Military Ban
“In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,” General Dunford said in a letter to the military service chiefs.
On Aug. 4, The Blade, a newspaper for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, reported, citing unnamed sources, that a policy guidance for reinstating the ban had been approved by the White House counsel’s office and by Mr. Trump and was expected to be delivered to Mr. Mattis.
Mr. Minter said that based on that report, “We wanted to move as quickly as possible to nip that in the bud.” The lawsuit’s complaint stated that “upon information and belief, the White House turned that decision into official guidance, approved by the White House counsel’s office, to be communicated to the Department of Defense.”
Still, as of Wednesday, the White House had yet to send any specific policy directive to the Pentagon, said Lt. Col. Paul Haverstick, a military spokesman. He said General Dunford’s statement from two weeks ago remained in effect.
“There is no change,” he said. “We are still waiting for more guidance from the White House.”
The lawsuit complaint argued that banning transgender people from serving in the military would be unconstitutional discrimination, violating their rights to equal protection and due process. It also argued that the Pentagon could not end people’s military careers for coming out openly as transgender because they did so in relying on the Pentagon itself saying they would be permitted to serve.
Colonel Haverstick said the military was “aware of the lawsuit; however, we are not able to comment due to the pending litigation.”
Other rights groups preparing similar legal challenges said on Wednesday that they were still holding off. Among them are both Outserve and Lambda, which have said they are recruiting plaintiffs for a joint lawsuit when the matter is ripe, a legal term meaning the facts of a case have developed enough for a decision.
