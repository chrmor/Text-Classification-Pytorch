Aberdeen to veto Rangers SPL bid
The Dons have followed other SPL clubs in fighting the potential inclusion of the Ibrox club next season, decreasing their chances of competing in the top flight significantly
"As we indicated two weeks ago there are many matters that have to be resolved regarding Rangers," Abderdeen chairman Stewart Milne said in a statement. "Traditionally we have preferred not to make public our voting intentions, but in light of the level of interest and the fact other clubs have chosen to show their hand, on this occasion I can confirm it is our intention to oppose readmission to the SPL for any Rangers NewCo. "If readmission were to be refused, we believe the appropriate course of action would be for Rangers NewCo to apply for membership to the SFA and to submit an application for admission to the SFL.
Aberdeen have revealed that they will reject the application from a newco Rangers to be included in the Scottish Premier League next season. The announcement is likely to consign the Glasgow club to life outside of the top-flight, after a host of SPL clubs made their similar views heard earlier in the week.The SPL have confirmed that the vote, due to take place on July 4th, cannot be brought forward. A majority of eight to four would be required to pass the SPL member share from Rangers FC PLC to Sevco 5088, which is seeking to establish the new Rangers club.
"One of our major objectives has to be to work with everyone concerned to ensure that the commercial challenges that this case has and will continue to cause can be mitigated as far as they possibly can so that sporting integrity can be the overriding factor.
"Reorganisation of the game is a priority and is something we have been actively involved in for a long time, but it is not something that should be rushed through just to deal specifically with one club.
"As we have indicated there are a number of other areas that we feel need to be addressed openly in the coming period if Scottish football fans are to feel that their views have been properly taken into account."
