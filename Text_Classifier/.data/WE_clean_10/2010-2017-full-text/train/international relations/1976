N Korea 'moves two more missile launchers'
Seoul: North Korea has moved two more missile launchers to its east coast, where preparations are apparently under way for a missile test as tensions simmer on the peninsula, reports say.
Expectations had been high that Pyongyang would carry out a test to coincide with celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's late founding leader Kim Il-sung on April 15 but it did not materialise.
The North Korean military last week moved two launchers believed to be for Scud missiles to the northeast province of South Hamgyong, Yonhap news agency said, citing a senior Seoul official.
"We have discovered the North has moved two additional TELs (transporter erector launchers) to the east coast ... after April 16," the official was quoted as saying on Sunday, adding Seoul and Washington were closely monitoring the site.
A spokesman for Seoul's defence ministry was not immediately available to confirm the report.
