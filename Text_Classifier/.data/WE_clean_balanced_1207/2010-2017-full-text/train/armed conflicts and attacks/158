Afghan officials attacked at scene of US killings
Gunmen in Afghanistan have launched an attack on a government delegation at a memorial service for 16 villagers who were killed by a US soldier.
Two of president Hamid Karzai's brothers were in the delegation from Kabul, along with provincial government officials, a local reporter at the scene in the Panjwayi district of southern Kandahar province said.
"There was an armed attack on them from a distance and the firing continued for about 10 minutes," the reporter told the AFP news agency.
"Bullets were coming like rain on us," another witness told AFP.
The interior ministry later confirmed that one Afghan soldier died.
"One or more enemy were hiding there. When the delegation arrived they fired - one soldier is dead and a policeman is injured," ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said.
US forces in a helicopter had spotted the insurgents closing in on the ceremony but were told not to fire on them, one villager, who was sitting near Kandahar police chief General Abdul Raziq at the ceremony, said.
He heard a police officer telling the general: "They (foreign soldiers) are saying that 12 armed men are spotted by the helicopters and asking 'should we shoot them?'"
According to the witness, the police chief replied: "No don't shoot them, send your men out there." Minutes later the shooting started.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban had vowed revenge after a US soldier walked off his base in the early hours of Sunday, broke into three houses and killed 16 people - mainly women and children.
Afghan ambassador to Australia, Nasir Ahmad Andisha, fears more of his people will join the Taliban after rampage.
He says his government and the US must act quickly to repair the relationship with the Afghan people.
"It's already used as a propaganda tool for the Taliban and they use people's outrage to recruit more people," he said.
"That's why our government is calling on restraint and the end of the night operations - the kind of operations that will bring about more anger."
Earlier, hundreds of students chanting "death to America" and proclaiming holy war staged Afghanistan's first protest against the massacre.
The mob blocked the main highway from Jalalabad to the capital Kabul.
"Jihad (holy war) is the only way to get the invading Americans out of Afghanistan," one banner read, before the protesters dispersed peacefully after about two hours.
The demonstration followed a call by parliament for the public trial of the shooter.
The demonstrators also demanded Mr Karzai reject plans to sign a strategic pact with Washington that would allow US advisers and possibly special forces to remain beyond a 2014 deadline for foreign combat troops to leave Afghanistan.
US defence secretary Leon Panetta said the soldier suspected of the killings could face the death penalty if convicted while US president Barack Obama has ordered an investigation into the incident.
Mr Panetta said the soldier would be brought to justice under the US military legal code, which allows for the death penalty in some cases.
Mass demonstrations last month, over the burning of copies of the Koran at a US military base, turned violent leading to about 40 deaths.
The US embassy has warned its citizens similar protests could erupt over Sunday's shooting.
Meanwhile, the Taliban has threatened to behead US troops in revenge for the massacre.
"The Islamic Emirate once again warns the American animals that the Mujahedeen will avenge them, and with the help of Allah will kill and behead your sadistic murderous soldiers," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an emailed statement.
Mr Obama said the shootings had only increased his determination to get American troops out of Afghanistan.
However, he cautioned there should not be a "rush to the exits" for US forces who have been fighting in Afghanistan since 2001.
He said the drawdown set for the end of 2014 should be done in a responsible way.
