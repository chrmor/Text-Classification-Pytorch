Peres praises Mubarak for his contribution to peace
"Mubarak's contribution to peace will never be forgotten," President Shimon Peres said Saturday.
The president made the comments during a European Friends of Israel (EFI) conference held in Jerusalem. Addressing 400 European parliament members Peres said he has known Mubarak for many years. "I thank him for saving many people's lives by preventing war."
Peres also commented on the possibility that the Egyptian president will leave the presidential palace in Cairo. "The biggest problem isn't changing the government but changing the face of a country as poor as Egypt," he said.
Referring to the Muslim Brotherhood Peres noted: "Elections in Egypt are dangerous. Should the Muslim Brotherhood be elected they will not bring peace. Democracy without peace is not a democracy. We fear there will be a change in government without a change in the circumstances which led to this state."
The president also addressed other issues such as peace talks with the Palestinians. "We are a little island in a turbulent ocean. We have no room for error. Everyone wants the two-state solution, but I suggest we talk about a two-democratic-state solution from now on."
Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama called on Mubarak to begin the process of handing over authorities. After another day of protests Obama stressed that only the Egyptian people will determine their future. Earlier on Saturday, the White House called the Egyptian president to take "concrete steps" to a transition.
"The key question he has to ask himself is: 'How do I leave a legacy behind in which Egypt can get through this transformation period?'" Obama said. "And my hope is he will end up making the right decision."
