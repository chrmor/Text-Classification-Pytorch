BMW to recall 150,000 vehicles in U.S.
DETROIT (Reuters) - BMW AG said on Tuesday that it would recall more than 150,000 vehicles in the United States due to the possibility of fuel pump failures.
BMW said some 130,000 of its 2007 to 2010 model year vehicles equipped with twin-turbo six-cylinder engines would be recalled for software updates and a potential replacement of a high-pressure fuel pump.
The automaker believes it will have to replace the high-pressure fuel pumps in 40,000 of the 130,000 vehicles.
BMW also is recalling separately about 20,800 of its 2008 model year X5 SUVs that have six-cylinder engines to replace the low-pressure fuel pumps.
