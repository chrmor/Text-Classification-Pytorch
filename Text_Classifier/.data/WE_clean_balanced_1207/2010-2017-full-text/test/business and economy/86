Genzyme and Sanofi-Aventis Reach an 'Agreement in Principle'
The deal will include a contingent value right (CVR)—a type of right given to shareholders of an acquired company that ensures they receive additional benefit if a specific event occurs—and will include more cash than the current $69 a share that Sanofi is offering, according to sources close to the deal.
How much cash the deal will include could not be determined.
Sanofi has begun due diligence on Genzyme , a process that could take a couple of weeks and is often not begun until some sort of deal structure has been hammered out.
