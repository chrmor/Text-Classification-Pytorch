Shark Tank Bursts At Shanghai Shopping Center [Video]
Shanghai, China – Several people were reportedly injured when a shark tank on the first floor of a shopping center suddenly burst. Customers standing near the display were showered with glass, water, and aquatic life.
The 33 ton aquarium burst without much warning on Tuesday, causing shards from its 10 inch thick glass barrier to rain down on several unsuspecting shoppers. As a result of this bizarre accident, 15 people were treated for injuries.
According to The Shanghaist, one man incurred a broken leg and several lacerations as a result of the falling glass. Other people involved in the shark tank accident were treated for scrapes, cuts, and bruises.
Unfortunately, the three lemon sharks, several turtles, and quite a few fish housed inside the aquarium at Shanghai Orient Shopping Center were killed in the accident. Authorities are currently unsure what caused the tank to burst.
“There were lots of injuries caused by flying glass, some of them serious because the glass was so thick. We are investigating what caused this,” a police spokesperson told the Austrian Times.
A number of display counters and merchandise were reportedly damaged by the exploding shark tank. Not surprisingly, the aquarium has turned out to be a bit more trouble that it’s worth. Although the display had become something of an attraction, the shopping center said it will not rebuild the tank.
This might be a good idea given the number of serious problems managers have had with the tank in recent months. Over the summer, a ruptured water pipe led to the death of two sharks and the removal of several turtles.
The folks at Practical Fishkeeping said an investigation into the accident is currently underway by health and safety officials. It’s currently unknown if the shopping center will face any fines or lawsuits as a result of busted shark tank.
