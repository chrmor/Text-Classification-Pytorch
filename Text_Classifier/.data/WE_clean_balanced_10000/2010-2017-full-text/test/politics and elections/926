Iraqi Parliament Breaks Deadlock to Elect a New Speaker
Iraq’s parliament elected a new speaker on Tuesday, a first step toward forming a government that can take decisive action to resolve Iraq’s security crisis.
Lawmakers chose Salim al-Jabouri, a moderate Sunni Islamist, as the army launched a fresh offensive to retake the town of Dhuluiya. Two days earlier, insurgents had pried the town, about 43 miles north of Baghdad, from government control.
