Prison for 5 in Murder of Journalist
MOSCOW — Moscow’s highest criminal court on Monday sentenced five men to prison, including two to life sentences, for the 2006 murder of the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, but left unsolved the question of who ordered the killing, the highest-profile attack on a Russian journalist of the last decade.
Ms. Politkovskaya, who was known for scathing criticism of Kremlin policies in the Russian republic of Chechnya and of the local strongman Ramzan A. Kadyrov, was 48 when she was shot to death in a contract killing in her Moscow apartment block.
On Monday, Judge Pavel Melyokhin sentenced Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, the organizer of the team that murdered Ms. Politkovskaya, and his nephew Rustam Makhmudov, the gunman, to life sentences in prison.
