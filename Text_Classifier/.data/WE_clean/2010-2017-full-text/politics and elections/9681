Rudd, Gillard shape up for Labor battle
Kevin Rudd is running for the Labor leadership to "finish the job" he was elected to do in 2007, saying Prime Minister Julia Gillard has lost the public's trust.
Ms Gillard, who maintains Mr Rudd has "undermined" her government since mid-2010, says trust is an area where he falls down.
The former prime minister held little back when announcing in Brisbane on Friday he would contest a caucus ballot in Canberra at 10am AEDT on Monday and criticised key government policy, such as the Malaysia asylum seeker swap deal.
"Rightly or wrongly Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people," Mr Rudd said.
"Starting on Monday I want to start restoring that trust and that's why I have decided to contest the leadership of the Australian Labor Party."
Following a similar pledge by Ms Gillard, Mr Rudd also promised not to mount a second challenge if he lost, which on present figures seems the most likely result.
