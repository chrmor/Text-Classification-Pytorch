Ben Ali reportedly in coma after stroke
JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 17 (UPI) -- Former Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali suffered a stroke and was in a coma in a Saudi Arabian hospital, a French online journalist reported.
Journalist Nicolas Beau, citing Tunisian sources, posted on his blog that Ben Ali was in critical condition in a medical facility in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Radio France Internationale reported Thursday.
It is believed the ousted leader was admitted to the hospital Tuesday under a false name, the blogger said.
The claim that Ben Ali was hospitalized also was reported by Web-zine JSSnews, although it reported he suffered a heart attack, RFI said.
Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia for 23 years before a popular uprising forced him to flee the country in January.
