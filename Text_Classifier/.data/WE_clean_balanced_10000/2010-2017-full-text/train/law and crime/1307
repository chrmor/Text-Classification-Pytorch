Suge Knight involved in hit-and-run on film set, victim dead
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- Marion "Suge" Knight, the former CEO of Death Row Records, was behind the wheel of a fatal hit-and-run, his attorney confirmed Thursday.
Knight, 49, was on the set of the upcoming N.W.A biopic, Straight Outta Compton, with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube at the scene, when he reportedly got into a fight with two men. According to TMZ, Knight fled in his car and ran over two bystanders, killing one and injuring the other.
Knight's lawyer, James E. Blatt, said the victim was Knight's friend, 55-year-old Terry Carter, a tow truck driver.
Initial reports incorrectly identified the deceased as 86-year-old actor Terry Carter, known for his roles on TV's McCloud and the original Battlestar Galactica.
Authorities told The Los Angeles Times that police were treating the incident as a homicide and not a traffic accident.
Blatt described the incident as a "tragic accident," and said his client would surrender to police.
Knight, who co-founded Death Row Records in 1991, was shot last August at a California nightclub.
