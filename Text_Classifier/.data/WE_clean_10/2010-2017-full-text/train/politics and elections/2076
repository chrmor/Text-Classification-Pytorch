Green TD Paul Gogarty concedes
Green Party TD Paul Gogarty has conceded the election, after initial tallies indicated he had not received enough first preference votes in his Dublin Mid West constituency.
In a post on his Twitter account this morning, Mr Gogarty said 10 per cent of the poll had been counted in his "strong areas".  
"Loads of 2, 3, 4, which is comforting, but not enough No 1s. I concede, with good grace," he wrote.
The Green Party, which had six TDs in the last Dáil, is expected to take about 2.7 per cent of the first preference votes in the election, according to an exit poll conducted for RTÉ.
The party is expected to get 5 per cent of first preference votes in Dublin, and 3 per cent in the rest of Leinster. Support for the party is at 2 per cent in Munster and 1 per cent in Connact and Ulster.
