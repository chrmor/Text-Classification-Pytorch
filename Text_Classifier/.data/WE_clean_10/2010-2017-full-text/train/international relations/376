Poland extradites Israeli 'agent' to Germany
Poland has extradited to Germany a suspected Israeli agent wanted in connection with the killing of a Hamas commander in Dubai, officials say.
Uri Brodsky, an Israeli citizen, faces charges relating to the forging of a passport allegedly used in January by the killers of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.
The UAE believes Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, was involved, though Israel insists there is no proof.
Mr Brodsky was arrested in Poland in June on a warrant issued by Germany.
The warrant accused him of espionage, though the court that granted the extradition said he could only be prosecuted for alleged forgery of a German passport believed to have been used by one of the assassins.
Dubai police have said they are 99% sure that members of Mossad were involved in the killing of Mabhouh, one of the founders of Hamas's military wing, who was found dead in a Dubai hotel on 20 January.
Forged passports from several Western countries were used by the 30 suspects identified, leading to a series of diplomatic rows with Israel.
The UK, Irish Republic and Australia have all expelled Israeli diplomats.
