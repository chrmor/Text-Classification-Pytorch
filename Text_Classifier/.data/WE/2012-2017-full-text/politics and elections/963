World Bank: Obama nominates Dartmouth's Jim Yong Kim
Reporting from Washington — President Obama on Friday nominated Dartmouth College President Jim Yong Kim, a physician and anthropologist by training, to succeed Robert Zoellick as the next president of the World Bank.
The naming of Kim was seen as a surprise.  Kim, 52, though highly regarded for his leadership in global health issues, is not well known in political or financial circles. But the appointment of the South Korean-born Kim may also deflect criticisms from developing economies of the United States having a lock on the World Bank's top position.
Kim, president of Dartmouth since 2009, was the former director of the World Health Organization's HIV/Aids department. Kim moved with his family to the United States at age 5 and grew up in Muscatine, Iowa, according to his biography posted in Dartmouth's website. He graduated from Brown University and received his medical degree from Harvard.
Zoellick, who has been president of the World Bank since 2007, said last month that he would step down after his five-year term ends in June.
