A series of bomb attacks targeting homes of Christian citizens in Baghdad, killed three and wounded 23 others Wednesday.
Attackers detonated at least 14 roadside bombs across the Iraqi capital and a mortar round struck in the southern Doura district, all targeting Christians and all within a two-hour period.
An al-Qaida militant group in Iraq is claiming responsibility for the attacks and say Christians and their organizations have become "legitimate targets" for al-Qaida militants.
