Storm Drenches Florida, Spawns Twister
MIAMIâ€”Florida braced for as much as 25 inches of rain as Tropical Storm Debby lumbered toward the state's northern Gulf Coast on Monday, already drenching the state with heavy rains, flooding low-lying areas and spawning tornadoes.
The storm's projected path had been tough to pin down, and forecasters at one point thought it was headed for Texas. But on Monday, officials at the National Hurricane Center said Debby appeared to settle on a northeastern track, crawling along in the Gulf of Mexico at 5 miles per hour.
