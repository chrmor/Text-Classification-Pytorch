Militant mortar attack on Latakia, Syria, kills dozens
DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- At least 23 people were killed and some 65 wounded Tuesday in a mortar attack on the Syrian coastal city of Latakia.
Two blasts occured on a highway connecting Latakia and the Russian airbase Hmeymim, where Russian forces are launching airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
One of the blasts targeted an area near Tishreen University, the third largest university in Syria.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Some speculate the militant coalition Ahrar al-Sham fired rockets from a village in the Latakia countryside.
In October, dozens of people were killed or injured in Russian airstrikes in Latakia province, as well as Hama, Idlib, Damascus, Aleppo and Deir ez-Zor provinces. Russia said the strikes targeted IS militants, but activist groups say the jihadist group has little to no presence in the coastal province of Latakia, which is the heartland of the ruling Alawite sect and a stronghold of forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
