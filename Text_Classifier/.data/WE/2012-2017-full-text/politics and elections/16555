As Uganda Votes, Polling Stations Open Hours Late and a Candidate Is Arrested
KAMPALA, Uganda — Ugandans went to the polls on Thursday to choose presidential and parliamentary candidates in an election riddled with irregularities even before voting began.
Polling stations in some parts of the capital, Kampala, did not open until after noon — nearly six hours late, and three hours before their scheduled closing time. Some did not open at all. At one polling station, voters waited seven hours for ballots to arrive, and when they did, they were for parliamentary candidates only.
And the leading opposition candidate for president, Kizza Besigye, was arrested after trying to get into a police command center in the Naguru neighborhood of Kampala, the police said. Mr. Besigye’s party, the Forum for Democratic Change, alleged that the command center was a “vote-rigging center.”
“He was with people knocking on gates and banging cars,” said an assistant police commissioner, Polly Namaye. Mr. Besigye was later released, his lawyer said.
