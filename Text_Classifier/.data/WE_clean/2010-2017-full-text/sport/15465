Jorge Lorenzo wins season-opening MotoGP event in Doha
DOHA, Qatar -- Defending champion Jorge Lorenzo of Spain led a 1-2 finish for Yamaha on Sunday in MotoGP's season-opening Qatar Grand Prix.
Starting from the pole for the third time at the illuminated Losail circuit, Lorenzo beat Italian teammate Valentino Rossi by a clear 5.99 seconds. Repsol Honda's 20-year-old newcomer Marc Marquez of Spain was third.
Lorenzo dominated from the start and had a clear lead by the halfway mark of the 22-lap race to earn his 24th MotoGP win, and second straight in Qatar.
The competition for third was more interesting, with Marquez overtaking last year's runner-up Dani Pedrosa with six laps to go.
Rossi returned to Yamaha this year after two seasons with Ducati, and said, "It feels so nice to have a Yamaha 1-2. It gives me another chance to do well for the team, and it's fantastic for the championship."
