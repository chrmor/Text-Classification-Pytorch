BHP swoops on Petrohawk for $US12b
Mining giant BHP Billiton has unveiled a $US12.1 billion ($11.2 billion) friendly takeover of US gas producer Petrohawk Energy Corp, marking the miner's biggest step into the booming shale-gas industry.
BHP said the two companies had entered into a definitive agreement for BHP to pay $US38.75 for each Petrohawk share in an all cash tender offer.
The announcement of the deal sent BHP's shares lower in morning trade, dropping 68 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $42.92.
The deal carries a total equity value of $US12.1 billion, and a total enterprise value of $US15.1 billion including debt.
The acquisition will give BHP assets covering about one million acres in Texas and Louisiana, with an estimated 2011 production of about 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent each day.
