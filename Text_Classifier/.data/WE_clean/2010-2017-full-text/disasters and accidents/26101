15 killed in landslide in Arunachal Pradesh
ITANAGAR: At least 15 labourers were killed when a massive landslide triggered by incessant rains hit a labour camp in Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh on Friday. The incident occurred at 3am when 17 labourers engaged in construction works were inside the camp at a place 4km away from Tawang town, additional deputy commissioner (headquarters) Lod Gambo said. "So far nine bodies have been extricated from the debris," Gambo said, adding incessant rain for the past couple of days had triggered landslides in several places of the border district. Gambo said rescue operation was on and two JCBs have been pressed into service to clear the debris. The PWD road in between New Lebrang and government higher secondary school has also been blocked due to landslide, while damages to residential buildings have been reported from the area. Heavy rainfall in the past few days in the district resulted in a flood-like situation which severely damaged the Kitpi Ph-I and Ph-II hydel projects. Power department officials said restoration work could not be started due to the continuous rain and both the power stations had been shut down due to the damage. Taking serious note of the situation, DC Duly Kamduk has directed the department concerned for assessment and submission of detailed report for action.
