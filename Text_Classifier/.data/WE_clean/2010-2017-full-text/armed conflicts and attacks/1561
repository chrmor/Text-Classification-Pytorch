Somali radio reporters walk out after Islamist takeover
Somali journalists have walked out of a radio station recently seized by Islamists in the capital, Mogadishu.
The staff at GBC said they refused to take orders from Hizbul Islam militants.
Previously, Hizbul Islam had allowed private radios to operate in their territory, only banning music, which they regard as unIslamic.
In Mogadishu, at least 19 people have been killed in heavy fighting, ahead of a crisis summit on Somalia at the UN.
UN chief Ban Ki-moon called for the meeting in New York to discuss the deepening political and security crisis.
Earlier this week, the prime minister resigned from the weak UN-backed transitional government led by moderate Islamist President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed.
The government, backed by a 6,000-strong African Union force, controls only small parts of the capital.
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says 19 people have been killed in the clashes that began on Thursday morning.
Some 68 people have also been injured as government soldiers, aided by African peacekeepers, battled Islamist militants in the north and south of the capital.
There has also been heavy shelling into the central Bakara market.
It's a welcome initiative on the part of the UN secretary-general if there is a fresh approach - one that looks at the security issues. What has happened so far is that Somali troops have been trained in different countries, but have never become a cohesive professional force. A new phase must begin which entails putting sufficient amounts of international resources into training 20,000 security forces in one place, such as Djibouti. The security issue must be coupled with a serious political programme. The personnel that currently occupy senior positions in the transitional federal government are exceptionally incompetent and so that has to be cleaned up. The president's rhetoric is great but his office is ramshackle. And despite the pledging of over $300m (Â£200m) [by the international community] a few months' back, much of that has not transpired and that which has has simply gone into supporting the African Union force.
Correspondents say radio stations provide a vital source of information for Mogadishu residents, who need to be constantly updated on which areas are unsafe.
The journalists from GBC, which was popular for its broadcasts of international football matches, said they had been ordered to refer to the government as "apostate".
"We defied because we do not want to lose our impartiality," one of the reporters said, asking not to be named for security reasons.
"It is unacceptable and part of the ongoing violations against the independence and the impartiality of the private media," said its deputy chairman Abdi Haji Gobdoon.
Last year nine journalists were killed in Somalia - the highest total in any one year since 1991, when armed conflict broke out following the collapse of the government of the former President Siad Barre.
Insurgents from the al-Qaeda linked al-Shabab group have recently intensified their campaign, and along with Hizbul Islam, controls much of south and central Somalia.
