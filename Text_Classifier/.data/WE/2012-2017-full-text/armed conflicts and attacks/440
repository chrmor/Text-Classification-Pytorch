Three minor blasts rock Bangkok, one hurt
BANGKOK: Three minor blasts rattled the Thai capital Bangkok on Tuesday, leaving a foreigner seriously wounded when a grenade he was suspected of carrying exploded, police said. "There were three explosions, but no dead," Police Major General Wichai Sungprapai said. The circumstances of the explosions, which occurred in eastern Bangkok outside the main business and tourist areas, were unclear. A man, believed to be Middle Eastern, had his legs torn off in one of the blasts on the side of a busy road, said Police Colonel Sithiparp Baiparaset.
He was admitted to Bangkok's Chulalongkorn Hospital where he was receiving emergency treatment, an official at the hospital said. The other blasts were reported to have occurred in a nearby house and road. The city has been on edge since the United States last month warned of a threat of a terrorist strike on tourist areas in Bangkok. Thai police later charged a Lebanese suspect after they raided a property and discovered chemicals that could be used to make a bomb.
