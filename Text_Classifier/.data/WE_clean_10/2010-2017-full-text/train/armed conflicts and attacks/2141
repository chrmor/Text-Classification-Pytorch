Wave of Attacks Kills Dozens in Iraq
BAGHDAD â€” A wave of attacks across Iraq killed more than 100 people on Thursday, including dozens of women and children at an amusement park, security and medical officials said.
The attacks, a series of car bombings, roadside bombings and armed assaults in Baghdad and five other provinces, also killed army security officers and police officers.
The attacks were an escalation of violence that had already claimed scores of lives across the country since the holy month of Ramadan began in late July and since Al Qaeda in Iraq said it would begin an offensive.
A car packed with explosives was detonated near the amusement park in Zaafaraniya, an area in eastern Baghdad, killing 34 people and wounding 57, mostly women and children, officials said. Earlier in the day, two roadside bombs in the neighborhood killed 2 people and wounded 11. In northern Baghdad, two car bombs exploded near a government building, leaving 7 dead and 42 wounded, the police said.
In the evening, a car blew up near a crowded cafe about 300 feet from a military checkpoint in Sadr City, a Shiite area of Baghdad, killing 23 people and wounding 58, security officials said.
Residents then pelted security forces with stones, saying they had let the car pass the checkpoint without being inspected.
