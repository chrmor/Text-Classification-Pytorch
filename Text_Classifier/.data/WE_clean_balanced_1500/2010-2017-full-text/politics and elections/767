Clinton clinches South Carolina as Sanders looks to Super Tuesday – as it happened
In Rochester, Minnesota, Bernie Sanders came on stage to the sound of Neil Young, and then didn’t mention South Carolina at all…
Bernie Sanders spent most of Saturday acting as if South Carolina didn’t exist. His first public appearance after news of his thumping loss to Hillary Clinton was no different.
Speaking to 2,600 supporters in Rochester, Minnesota, he came across a little more subdued than the fiery orator we had seen in Texas in the afternoon. But it had been a long day in more ways than one.
In a none-too-subtle sign that he plans to fight hard for a dozen more states on Super Tuesday, Sanders came on stage to the sound of Neil Young singing: “Keep on rockin’ in the free world.”
Perhaps, I was imagining it, but the only slight change to the standard stump speech that followed was a fraction more reticence when it came to bashing his Democratic opponent in public.
“Let me take a brief moment to outline some of the differences between ours and Secretary Clinton’s campaign,” he told the Rochester crowd, almost apologetically, before reeling off a truncated version of his standard attacks on her Wall Street links.
There is a palpable sense in the campaign now that even if it carries on through to this summer’s convention, Clinton is likely to be the nominee that all Democrats rely on to beat Donald Trump come November.
While some candidates might be expected to go more negative after a night like tonight, this progressive champion will not want to be remembered as the man who guided Trump toward the chinks in Clinton’s armour.
