BBC to rush out special edition of Panorama on Jimmy Savile
The BBC is hopeful that a special edition of Panorama looking into Jimmy Savile will be broadcast on Monday.
BBC1 chiefs are preparing to drop the planned edition of the investigative programme on Monday to slot in the Savile programme, with staff working all weekend to deliver it in time.
They are said to be determined to ensure there are no delays following criticism over a proposed Newsnight investigation into the late TV presenter that was shelved late last year.
The BBC has consistently denied the report was dropped because it would have been at odds with celebratory tribute programmes which were also in the pipeline, although an independent inquiry is being launched to look into the issue, led by former Sky News executive Nick Pollard.
BBC1 boss Danny Cohen is aiming to broadcast the programme on Monday if the production team can deliver it by then, and may consider moving other programmes, such as drama New Tricks, if the programme runs longer than the half-hour 8.30pm slot in the schedule.
Tom Giles, editor of Panorama, said: ''We are working hard to ensure that the programme is ready as soon as possible.''
The published schedule has an investigation into gambling, presented by Sophie Raworth, pencilled in for this Monday.
But contributors to the programme had been told that the intention is for the Savile investigation to be shown instead.
There have been suggestions that the BBC was looking to show the programme after director-general George Entwistle appears before MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday morning.
But a BBC source said that was not the case, saying: ''It's our absolute intention to get this show out on Monday. It's purely down to whether it is delivered in time.''
Allegations about Savile's activities began to flood out in the wake of an ITV documentary screened earlier this month.
Police believe the DJ and television presenter's alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades and included about 60 victims.
As well as police investigations, inquiries are taking place into his involvement with Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary.
Dame Janet Smith, who headed the Shipman Inquiry, is heading an inquiry into Savile's time at the BBC.
