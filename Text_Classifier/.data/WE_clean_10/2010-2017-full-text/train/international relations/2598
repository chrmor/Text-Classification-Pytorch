North Korea punished by US over sinking of warship
President Barack Obama today froze the US assets of three North Korean organisations and one individual, a US official said, in part to punish Pyongyang for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March with the loss of 46 lives. Obama signed an order to widen the scope of US sanctions to allow Washington to go after the assets of North Korean organisations that trade in conventional arms and luxury products, and that counterfeit US currency. North Korea last week released US citizen Aijalon Gomes, who had been sentenced to eight years' hard labour for entering the country illegally.
