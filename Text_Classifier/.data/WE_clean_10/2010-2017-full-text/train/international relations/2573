Taiwan students storm education ministry in textbook protest
Hundreds of students in Taiwan have stormed the education ministry, protesting against proposed changes to the curriculum.
At least 200 students scaled the building's fences overnight and camped in the compound in the capital, Taipei.
The students want revisions to Taiwan's textbooks, which they say promote a pro-China view, to be retracted.
It is the latest in a series of student protests and comes after a student leader killed himself on Thursday.
Students in Taiwan have led several protests against closer relations with China over the past year.
Last year, students occupied Taiwan's parliament for 24 days in what were the largest anti-China demonstrations in years, successfully blocking legislative approval of a controversial trade deal with China.
China formally regards Taiwan as a part of its territory, despite the island governing itself for six decades. The two sides split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Hundreds of students remained outside the education ministry on Friday, chanting "step down, minister" and "retract the curriculum".
Education Minister Wu Se-hwa was heckled when he briefly tried to address the crowd, AFP news agency said.
Correspondents say the protests have escalated following the suicide of student activist Lin Kuan-hua, who police say killed himself on Thursday morning.
The 20-year-old had been charged with breaking into the education ministry last week.
