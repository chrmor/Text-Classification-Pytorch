Austrian driver with mind-controlled bionic arm dies after crash
An Austrian man who was the first European to use a mind-controlled bionic arm to help him drive has died after a fiery crash. His other arm was also artificial.
Christian Kandlbauer, 22, was taken off life support Thursday night, two days after a trucker pulled him from the burning wreckage of his his specially modified Subaru, which hit a tree, the Austrian Independent first reported. Police say they don't know what role, if any, his artificial arms may have played in the accident, which remains under investigation.
Kandlbauer lost both arms five years ago from a 20,000-volt jolt he got while climbing a power tower. Doctors harvested nerves from the arms, attached them to his chest muscles and then connected them to a robotic left arm he controlled through his thoughts. After rehabilitation, the one-time mechanic worked as a clerk at his old garage. In 2006, he passed his driving test.
Earlier this year Kandlbauer spoke to the BBC. "I feel very happy," he said. "It is like my earlier arm — I feel that my arm is a part of my body."
Otto Bock Group, which provided the robotic arm, posted a tribute to Kandlebauer, saying the firm's employees were "deeply shaken and are mourning for a man who had become their friend over the years of their partnership."
We admired and supported Christian Kandlbauer. He accepted his fate in a manner that commanded great respect from all of us. The courage to face life and the firm belief in living as part of society were his constant companions. Christian Kandlbauer has a firm place in the future as the pioneer of a technology that will permit many people to resume their everyday lives.
