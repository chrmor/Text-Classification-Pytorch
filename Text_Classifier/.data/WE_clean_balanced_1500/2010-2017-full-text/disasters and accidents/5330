KUNMING, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- One person has been killed and 14 others are missing after rain-triggered flooding hit a county in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
Downpours swept Huaping County from Tuesday night to the small hours of Wednesday, with precipitation of 282.4 mm, said the information office of Lijiang City.
The storm caused the local Liyu River to break its banks, inundating several residential communities and causing record flooding in one.
Tianping Village was hit by a landslide that devastated the houses of 14 families, leaving one dead, one injured and 14 others missing.
Local authorities have evacuated residents. Traffic controls have been imposed on flooded streets.
A search for the missing is under way and authorities are counting the costs of the disaster.
