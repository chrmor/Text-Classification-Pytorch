8 injured when bus carrying church group rolls over
(CNN) -- Eight people were seriously injured when a tour bus carrying a church group lost control, slid off the road and rolled onto its side on an icy highway in Colorado, authorities said.
The bus had 46 people onboard at the time of the crash, which occurred about 8 p.m. Saturday on a snow-covered highway in Gunnison County, the Colorado State Patrol said in a statement.
Eight of the passengers were taken to the hospital with serious injuries, but none of the injuries were life-threatening, spokesman Trooper Nate Reid said.
The bus was transporting a church group from Denton, Texas, to Crested Butte, Colorado, the patrol said.
Authorities were still investigating the crash late Saturday.
