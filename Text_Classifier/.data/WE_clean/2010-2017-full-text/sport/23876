Sao Paulo (AFP) - Corinthians sealed a sixth Brazilian league title after a late 1-1 draw at Vasco de Gama late Thursday gave them an unassailable 12-point lead with three games remaining.
Having slumped out of the Libertadores Cup early, the Sao Paulo outfit famous for their black and white shirts and former players such as 1970 World Cup hero Rivellino, went top in Brazil after match-day 18 and have been there since.
The title clinching round saw their nearest rivals Atletico Mineiro beaten 4-2 at Sao Paulo, while striker Wagner Love's goal for Corinthians at Vasco earned them a 1-1 draw.
A great deal of Corinthians' success is being put down to coach Adenor Leonardo Bachi, who came back this season from a sabbatical year where he observed Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.
Back in 2012 under Bachi, Corinthians won South America's premier club competition the Libertadores Cup before going on to win the World Club Cup in Japan the same year.
