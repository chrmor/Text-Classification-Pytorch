Mariusz Wach's "B" Sample is Also Positive For Steroids
Earlier this year, heavyweight Mariusz Wach (27-1, 15 KOs) received notification from the German Boxing Federation that he was being suspended for twelve months due to a postive drug test result in the aftermath of his November fight with unified champion Wladimir Klitschko. Wach was badly beaten and lost a twelve round unanimous decision. After the match, Wach's "A" sample tested positive for anabolic steroids.
Wach was notified by the German board that his suspension starts from the date of his fight with Wladimir - November 10th - and he also has to pay a fine of 5,113 euro.
A few weeks later, Wach protested the result of the "A" sample and had his "B" sample tested. The final result of the "B" sample testing was returned on Thursday and confirmed the initial results with yet another positive reading for anabolic steroids.
Wach believes the substance in his body may have come from supplements that he was given during training camp.
