1 dead in Long Island workplace shooting
One man was killed and another was wounded after a man walked into a suburban New York business and began shooting, local officials said.
The incident took place Wednesday morning at Savenergy in East Garden City on Long Island.
Police identified the suspect is 63-year-old Sang Ho Kim, and said he was last seen wearing a red shirt and dark suit jacket. He fled the scene in a white Honda SUV that police said was found late Wednesday about 60 miles north in Putnam County.
Detective Michael Bitsko of the Nassau County Police Department told CNN the suspect is a former employee at the light fixture manufacturer.
A local mall went on lock-down at the request of police after the shooting was reported, shortly after 10 a.m.
