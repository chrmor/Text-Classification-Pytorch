Five dead, 10 injured in microbus crash in Egypt's New Valley governorate
Five people died and 10 others were injured in a microbus crash in Egypt's New Valley governorate during the early hours of Sunday, the state owned MENA news agency reported. 
The microbus overturned on a deserted road near the southwest governorate of New Valley. 
Major General Mohamed Qassim, head of the New Valley security directorate, said that more than 10 ambulances arrived to the scene in addition to civil protection vehicles and police forces. 
Road accidents are frequent in Egypt due to a lack of road maintenance and loosely implemented traffic laws.
According to the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS), the rate of car accidents during the first half of 2015 increased by 3.5 percent.
A total of 14,403 road accidents in Egypt led to the deaths of 6,226 people and the injury of 24,154 others in 2014, according to CAPMAS.
