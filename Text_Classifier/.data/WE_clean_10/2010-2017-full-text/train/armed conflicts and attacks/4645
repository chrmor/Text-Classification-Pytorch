Arabian Al Qaeda's number two confirmed killed in US drone strike
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has confirmed the death of its deputy leader Saeed al-Shehri in a US drone strike.
The killing was first announced in January when Yemeni authorities said he had died after suffering injuries in an operation by Yemeni security forces on November 28, 2012, in the northern province of Saada.
But several months later the militant group released what it called a newly delivered address by Shehri.
Senior Al Qaeda official Ibrahim al Rubaish has now confirmed the death in a video statement posted online.
In the video Rubaish said Shehri had been killed in a drone attack, but did not say when, according to SITE, a US-based monitoring website.
"I present my condolences to all the Mujahideen on the martyrdom of Saeed Al Shehri who was killed in a US drone attack," he said.
Shehri was described by US officials as one of the most important Al Qaeda-linked militants to be released from detention at Guantanamo Bay.
The Saudi national was detained there in January 2002 after Pakistan handed him to US authorities.
He had been freed by US authorities from detention and went on to become second-in-command of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
