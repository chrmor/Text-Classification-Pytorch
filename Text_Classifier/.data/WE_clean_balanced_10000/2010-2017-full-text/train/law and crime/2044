Zambia's former president, Rupiah Banda, was arrested by police for alleged abuse of authority and corruption.
Banda, 76, who ruled Zambia from 2008 to 2011, was charged with corruption Monday and released on bail of Kwacha 500,000 ($100,000) and ordered to turn in his passport.
Namukolo Kasumpa, spokesperson for the government investigating team, told journalists that Banda will appear in court on Tuesday. Banda is also scheduled to be questioned by the investigating panel on April 4.
He is accused of stealing $11 million, part of which he had used on his re-election campaign of 20 September 2011. Banda has denied all the charges.
