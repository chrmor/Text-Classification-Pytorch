Iran opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi's car has been fired on in the country's northern city of Qazvin.
Mr Karroubi was in the car at the time but was not said to be hurt.
According to a website associated with Mehdi Karroubi, he was in the northern town of Qazvin attending a mourning ceremony for opposition members killed in recent protests, when a violent confrontation broke out.
Hundreds of members of the pro-government beseige militia surrounded the building he was in, chanted slogans in support of the government and attacked with stones, breaking the windows.
The website said after 4 hours, riot police managed to get Mr Kerroubi out of the building. As his car was pulling away, it was attacked and hit by gunfire.
The website said said because his car was armoured, the only damage was to the windows.
