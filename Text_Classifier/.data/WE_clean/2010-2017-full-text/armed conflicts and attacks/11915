Arrests outside Ecuador's London embassy
Tension is high outside London's Ecuadorian embassy where police are clashing with supporters of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
An announcement is expected from Quito at 1pm London time (10pm AEST) on whether or not Ecuador has granted asylum to Assange, who is inside the embassy.
At least five people have been arrested, some forcibly led away by uniformed officers, as some protesters use loudspeakers to condemn the actions of British authorities in threatening to breach the embassy's diplomatic immunity.
"So much for freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate," cried another.
More than 40 police line Hans Crescent in the exclusive suburb of Knightsbridge, where the WikiLeaks chief has been holed up for 57 days in his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations.
