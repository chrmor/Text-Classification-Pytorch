A blizzard walloped portions of the nation's midsection Tuesday while parts of the Plains and South contended with severe weather.
Heavy snow and high winds brought blizzard conditions to parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska and Kansas on Tuesday morning. More than a foot of snow was possible in the Denver area, where a section of I-25 was forced to close due to blowing snow and jack-knifed trucks.
The highest total from the snowstorm so far was two feet reported near Ouray, Colo., in the southwestern part of the state.
On Tuesday morning, 145 arrivals and departures were canceled for Denver International Airport,KUSA-TV reported. Delays were also reported as the storm was forecast to dump up to 16 inches of snow at the airport.
Deicing is underway at the airport as of just before noon MST, KUSA-TV reported. One hour delays are expected.
Snow is also falling in Wyoming and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. The snow is forecast to taper off Tuesday night, as the storm lifts northward into the Upper Midwest.
Further to the east and south, severe thunderstorms and heavy rain are battering the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley throughout the day on Tuesday.
Damage was reported in the Dallas area as a line of thunderstorms rolled through during the early morning hours, WFAA-TV reported.
A tornado watch has been posted for eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southern Arkansas.
In addition to the severe weather, drenching rain will soak much of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri, where flash flooding is possible.
The system will move east Wednesday, bringing showers and thunderstorms to the Ohio Valley and southeastern U.S., finally reaching the Eastern Seaboard by early Thursday morning, the weather service said.
