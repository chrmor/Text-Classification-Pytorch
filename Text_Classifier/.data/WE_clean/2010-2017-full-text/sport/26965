LeBron James and Cavaliers Rout Warriors, Forcing Game 7
CLEVELAND — The Golden State Warriors have challenged LeBron James in every possible way. They have thrown waves of defenders at him, called him a crybaby and made fun of him on social media. During one memorable exchange, Draymond Green even took a swipe at his groin.
Through all the noise and extracurriculars of the N.B.A. finals, a series that has played out with the elegance of a mudslide, James has remained the steadfast captain at the wheel of the Cleveland Cavaliers, guiding his team away from elimination — twice now — and filling this championship-starved city with hope.
On Thursday night, James guided the Cavaliers to a 115-101 victory over the Warriors at Quicken Loans Arena to even the series at three games apiece.
Game 7 is scheduled for Sunday night at Oracle Arena, where the league will crown a champion, if only because the series will have run out of games and exhausted its supply of drama.
