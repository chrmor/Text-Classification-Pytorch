Netanyahu to shift blame over deadly raid on Gaza flotilla
JERUSALEM: Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to assign blame for Israel's raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla on his outgoing military chief when the PM appears today before a judicial inquiry investigating the incident.
Mr Netanyahu will be asked to explain his role in ordering the raid that resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish citizens and justify Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza, a tiny enclave that is home to 1.5 million Palestinians.
Mr Netanyahu's testimony will be the first time the Prime Minister has been required to give a detailed public explanation of who authorised what, and when.
Mr Netanyahu will be followed tomorrow by the Defence Minister, Ehud Barak, and on Wednesday by the Israeli Defence Forces chief-of-staff, Gabi Ashkenazi.
All the testimonies will be given in court in Jerusalem.
In the early hours of May 31, Israeli commandos were ordered to prevent a six-ship convoy carrying humanitarian aid from breaching Israel's blockade of Gaza or entering Israeli-controlled waters.
