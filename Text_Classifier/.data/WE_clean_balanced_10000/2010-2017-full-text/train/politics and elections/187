1 year without full government in Belgium
Brussels - Belgium marks an anniversary on Tuesday, but no one is celebrating. One year ago, King Albert II accepted the resignation of the government. And one election and countless negotiating sessions later, the search for a new governing coalition still goes on. Expectations are that no deal to grant more autonomy to Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia will be found before the summer. Caretaker Prime Minister Yves Leterme said on Tuesday that up to three more months could be required to form a coalition. European Union President Herman Van Rompuy, who was Belgian prime minister before going to the EU in December 2009, called the situation "extremely pitiful".
