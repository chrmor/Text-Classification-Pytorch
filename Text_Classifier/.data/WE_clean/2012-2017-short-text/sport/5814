The second semifinal between Burkina Faso and Ghana goes to extra-time, with Burkina Faso denied a potentially winning goal by Tunisian referee Slim Jedidi. The referee also ejects Jonathan Pitroipa, when replays show he was fouled. Burkina Faso wins, 1–1 (penalties: 3–2), and advances to the final. (Goal.com) (Al Jazeera) (BBC)
