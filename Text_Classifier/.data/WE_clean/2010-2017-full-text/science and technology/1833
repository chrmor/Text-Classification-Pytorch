Vatican slams Nobel win for IVF doc
The Vatican has criticised a decision to award the Nobel Prize for Medicine to IVF pioneer Robert Edwards, who has brought the joy of parenthood to millions of infertile couples.
"I find the choice of Robert Edwards completely out of order," Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, which speaks for the Vatican on medical ethics issues, told ANSA news agency on Monday.
"Without Edwards, there would not be a market on which millions of ovocytes are sold ... and there would not be a large number of freezers filled with embryos in the world," he was quoted as saying.
"In the best of cases they are transferred into a uterus, but most probably they will end up abandoned or dead, which is a problem for which the new Nobel Prize winner is responsible."
These statements were heavily moderated in a transcript of his interview with ANSA, which was obtained by AFP later on Monday.
In the transcript, Carrasco de Paula called the choice of Edwards understandable and said the scientist should not be underestimated.
