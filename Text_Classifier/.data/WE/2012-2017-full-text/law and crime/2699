Israel drops military exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews
Israel is dropping a decades-old exemption from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox Jewish men.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered the army today to prepare for a universal draft of ultra-Orthodox Jewish males in 30 days, ending the 63-year exemption.
The order came just hours before the expiration of a law that has granted tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews exemptions from military duty and followed a Supreme Court ruling against extending that arrangement, the Associated Press reports.
The 30-day preparation period, however, does create some wiggle room for a legislative compromise over the controversial issue, which has caused a major rift among Israelis.
Ultra-Orthodox leader Meir Porush, a former lawmaker, says drafting his people would unleash a "civil war." He says the military neither needs nor wants to be flooded with devoutly religious conscripts.
The exemption, which involved only a few hundred top rabbinical students in 1949, has mushroomed into an exemption that has allowed 60,000 able-bodied men to forego military service each year.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reported to have said that, under the plan, half of ultra-Orthodox Jews between ages 18 and 23 would be drafted by the defense forces and another half would be drafted into operational civil service for ages 23 to 26, the BBC reports.
Most other Jews are drafted into the military at age 18, with men serving three years and then decades of yearly reserve duty, and women serving about two years, the Associated Press reports.
