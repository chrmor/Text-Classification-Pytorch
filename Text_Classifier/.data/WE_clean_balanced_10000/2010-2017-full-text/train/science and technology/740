Xbox One Announced
After months of speculation, Microsoft finally revealed its next-generation console today: the Xbox One.
Microsoft called the system an "all in one system" for games, entertainment, and television.
The system includes 8GB of RAM, an 8-Core CPU, a 500GB hard drive, a Blu-ray drive, HDMI in and out ports, USB 3.0, 802.11n wireless, and more. It also includes a new version of the Kinect sensor. The Xbox One will not require an always-on internet connection.
The news came during today’s much-hyped Xbox Reveal event and puts numerous rumors to rest including names like Fusion, Xbox 720, Xbox 8 and Loop. It also ends the need for the system’s long-running codename, Durango.
