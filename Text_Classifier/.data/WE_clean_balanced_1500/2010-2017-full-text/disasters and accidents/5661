Bushfire destroys homes
Several homes are feared to have been destroyed as a bushfire and a fast-running grassfire burn out of control and threaten lives in Melbourne's north-east.
More than 350 firefighters, 60 trucks and six water-bombing aircraft are battling a grassfire burning through housing estates north of Craigieburn and a bushfire in Warrandyte.
One house is confirmed to have been lost at Warrandyte, and one at Mickleham.
"The community of Beveridge is being impacted as we speak," Kangaroo Ground incident control centre commander Chris Hardman said.
