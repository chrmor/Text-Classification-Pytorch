China Summons U.S. Envoy Over $1.83B Arms Sale to Taiwan
The arms deal includes two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates and amphibious assault vehicles as well as anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles. Most of the hardware dates from the 1970s.
Taiwanâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the sale would help peace and stability, boosting "our confidence as we engage in dialogue and improve relations across the Taiwan Strait," the body of water that separates it from the mainland.
China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province. The U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan as an independent nation but has sold it $12 billion in arms since 2010 as part of an agreement dating to the 1970s that commits Washington to helping the island defend itself.
