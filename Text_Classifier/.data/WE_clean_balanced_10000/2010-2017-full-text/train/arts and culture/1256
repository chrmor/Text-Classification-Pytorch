Musical Chicago to close after 15 years
The musical, which went on to be made into an Oscar-winning film starring Catherine Zeta Jones, will see the curtain come down on 1 September.
Guest roles have gone to figures such as Brooke Shields, Christie Brinkley and David Hasselhoff over the years. It holds the record as the West End’s longest-running revival.
Barry Weissler, who has produced the show along with his wife Fran in New York, London and other locations around the world, said: “Bringing Chicago to the West End was a pivotal moment in Fran’s and my career.
“Running 15 years has been a dream come true. We may be taking our parting shots for now, but the razzle dazzle will never fade.”
Composer John Kander said: “The fact that the London audience has embraced our show for 15 years fills me with gratitude and pride.”
The show drew instant acclaim when it opened in November 1997 with Ruthie Henshall, Ute Lemper, Henry Goodman and Nigel Planer in the main roles.
Others who have appeared include Ugly Betty’s America Ferrera, Anita Dobson, Jill Halfpenny, Denise Van Outen and Gaby Roslin.
It originally opened at the Adelphi Theatre, later transferring to the Cambridge Theatre and then moving to its present home at the Garrick Theatre last year.
