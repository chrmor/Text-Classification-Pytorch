Wen promises political reforms but only under CPC
Virtually ruling out introduction of multi-party democracy in the country, 69-year-old Wen said the nation would seek political reform but gave no proposals or a timetable for opening up the political system.
Apparently mindful of the impact of a political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa, the premier rejected any comparison between conditions in his country and revolutions taking place in the Arab world.
With hardly two years left for his term, Wen regarded as a reformer and an advocate of political reforms to loosen the grip of party on state structure, said political restructuring should be pushed forward in an orderly way as it requires stable and harmonious social conditions.
China "It is by no means easy to pursue political restructuring in a big country like China with 1.3 billion people. It requires a stable and harmonious social environment and it needs to be taken up in orderly way under the leadership of the party (CPC)," he said at his annual press conference telecast live all over the country.
Chairman of the NPC Wu Bangguo, who is ranked second in CPC hierarchy above Wen in the politburo, said in his address during the weekend China would slip into a possible "abyss of internal disorder" if it strays from the "correct political orientation".
China will never adopt a "multi-party revolving-door system or other Western-style political models", Wu said, dismissing attempts by dissidents groups to stir up Arab-style protests.
Wen briefly referred to political turbulence sweeping Gulf and northern African countries, but ruled out chances of such unrest taking place in China asserting that any analogy between it and those countries is "not right".
"We have embarked on a development path that fits China's national conditions," Wen said, adding that China will continue to "put people's interests first".
His comments came as overseas dissident groups tried to stir up Arab-style protests during past few weeks. Chinese police averted them with stepped security.
Several foreign journalists have been warned that their accreditations and visas will be cancelled if any rules were violated in providing proactive coverage for such incidents.
