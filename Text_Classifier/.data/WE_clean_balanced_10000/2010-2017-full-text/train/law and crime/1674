Protests for kidnapped girls banned in Nigerian capital
Police in Nigeria's capital have banned all protests planned in support of the more than 200 girls kidnapped in April.
Commissioner Joseph Mbu said the proliferation of such protests "is now posing a serious security threat" to those living around, and driving through, demonstration sites in the capital city of Abuja.
"I cannot fold my hands and watch this lawlessness," he said in a statement Monday.
"Information reaching us is that too soon dangerous elements will join the groups under the guise of protest and detonate explosive(s) aimed at embarrassing the government. Accordingly protests on the Chibok Girls is hereby banned with immediate effect," the commissioner continued.
