2012-09-07 APEC Summit in Russia
  It's once again time for government leaders from the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, forum to put their heads together as they work to meet common challenges and promote free trade in the region. It is also a chance for the host of the APEC summit to advance its own agenda. The fact that Russia, host of this year's summit, is staging the annual event in Vladivostok, a city in the country's far east, reveals that Russia is looking eastward for new growth opportunities. Another thing that may gain traction again during the APEC summit is the idea of an APEC-wide FTA that envisions a region entirely free from trade barriers. The biggest obstacle, however, comes from a lack of trust among Asian giants, troubled by lingering historical disputes. Chinese President Hu Jintao is attending the summit and is expected to deliver several keynote speeches during the gathering. So, what will this year's APEC summit bring to Russia? And how can APEC member economies rise above their differences and facilitate multilateral trade in the region? We talk to Prof. Tagir Khuziyatov from the Department of International Economics and Program Coordinator of the APEC Study Center at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Russia and Prof. Shen Shishun, Dean of the Foreign-Concerned Economy Faculty, Haikou College of Economics.
