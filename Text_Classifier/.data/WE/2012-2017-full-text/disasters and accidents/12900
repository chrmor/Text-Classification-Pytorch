TS Ana makes landfall in South Carolina
The first Atlantic tropical storm of the year weakened as it made landfall in South Carolina early Sunday.
Ana is now a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said in its 2 p.m. ET update. Warnings and watches were lifted.
As a tropical storm, Ana had sustained winds at 50 mph. When it came ashore just north of Myrtle Beach at 6 a.m. Sunday, winds were at 45 mph, the hurricane center said.
"On the forecast track, the center of Ana will move over eastern North Carolina later today and tonight," the center said. The storm is expected to continue northward.
Along its path, Ana is bringing heavy rain and storm surges.
The storm is forecast to drop 2 to 4 inches of rain -- up to 6 inches in isolated spots -- over the eastern Carolinas, the center said. During high tide, storm surges were forecast to send 1 to 2 feet of water onto coastal land. Combined with rain, that could cause flooding in low-lying spots, the weather service said. Beachgoers should take Ana seriously -- high rip currents could sweep swimmers out to sea, and waves are expected to be rough. The winds could break tree limbs, cause scattered power outages and do minor damage to porches, awnings, carports and sheds, said the NWS in Wilmington, North Carolina.
