Car bomb kills 12 in Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad
A car bomb blast on a busy street of Baghdadâ€™s largest Shiite neighborhood killed at least 12 people, Iraqi police and medical sources said Thursday.
The bomb, which exploded near a cafe in Sadr City late Wednesday, also left at least 33 people wounded, the sources said.
The sprawling northeastern district is hit by suicide, roadside and other bombs almost every week.
According to the United Nations, more than 1,110 people were killed in acts of violence across Iraq last month.
While the bloodshed has been mainly on the frontlines where federal, Kurdish and allied forces battle the Islamic State jihadist group, blasts and executions in Baghdad continue to take a heavy toll.
