After 139 years of ferry crossings between the Danish town of Esbjerg and Harwich in England, MSÂ Sirena Seaways carries passengers on the route for the last time as DFDS closes the route due to "dwindling demand and high costs"; a freight service will still be available on the route from Esbjerg to Immingham.
