(LEAD) S. Korea, China discuss measures against N. Korea's rocket plan: FM
SEOUL, Dec. 6 (Yonhap) -- South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan said Thursday that his government has been in consultations with China over possible actions to take if North Korea launches a long-range rocket this month. Asked by a lawmaker at a parliamentary session whether Seoul discussed possible sanctions with Beijing against the North's planned rocket launch, Kim replied, "Consultations are under way."   Kim said that South Korea and China "have been in consultations over contents in case of North Korea's launch, but no consensus has been reached yet."   North Korea plans to carry out the launch between Monday and Dec. 22 to put what it calls a "working satellite" into orbit, a move condemned by Seoul, Washington and others as veiled tests of banned ballistic missile technology.
