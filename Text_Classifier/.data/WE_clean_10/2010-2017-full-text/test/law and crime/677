WikiLeaks publishes CIA chief's personal info
"The hacking of the Brennan family account is a crime and the Brennan family is the victim," the CIA said in a statement. "The private electronic holdings of the Brennan family were plundered with malicious intent and are now being distributed across the web. This attack is something that could happen to anyone and should be condemned, not promoted. There is no indication that any the documents released thus far are classified. In fact, they appear to be documents that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess."
