TVNZ Breakfast broadcaster Paul Henry questions Prime Minister John Key about whether New Zealand's ethnic minority Governor-General Anand Satyanand, representative of Queen Elizabeth II, is a proper New Zealander. Henry has previously described singer Susan Boyle as "retarded" and homosexuality as "unnatural", though the state-owned broadcaster defends him, furthering the controversy. (AFP via The Age)
