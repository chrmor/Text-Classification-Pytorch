DUBAI (Reuters) - At least 22 people were killed when a truck laden with gravel collided with a bus carrying 46 Asian migrant workers in the oasis town of al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates, police said on Monday.
The truck driver lost control of his vehicle, causing it to land on top of the bus and trap its passengers under the cargo of gravel, police said of Sundayâ€™s incident.
Twenty-four people were injured, at least five critically, officials from two hospitals in al-Ain said. The police did not disclose the nationalities of the dead, but Dubai-based Gulf News daily reported they were mostly from Bangladesh.
