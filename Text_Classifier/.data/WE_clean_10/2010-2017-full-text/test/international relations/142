Berlin, Vienna in Talks Over All-European Asylum Law
Chief of Staff of the German Chancellery Peter Altmaier said that the talks between Vienna and Berlin were mostly focused on migration burden sharing and a common decision on granting refugees with asylum.
MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Berlin and Vienna are currently in talks over a common European asylum law, Chief of Staff of the German Chancellery Peter Altmaier said.
"I am working closely with my Austrian colleague [Josef] Ostermayer. We talk about how such a system [on asylum law] could look like," Altmaier, who is also Germany's refugee crisis coordinator, told in an interview with the Focus magazine.
Altmaier said the talks were mostly focused on migration burden sharing and a common decision on granting refugees with asylum.
According to him, the negotiators will soon ask France and the Netherlands to join the talks on common asylum law.
The European Union is currently struggling to manage a massive refugee crisis, with hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict-torn countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Many of them seek to reach such wealthy states as Germany and Austria.
