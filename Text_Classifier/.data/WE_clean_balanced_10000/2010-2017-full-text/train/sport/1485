QPR favourite McDonald dies
Former Northern Ireland and QPR defender Alan McDonald has died suddenly at the age of 48.
McDonald, who managed Glentoran to the Irish League title in 2009, collapsed while playing golf on Saturday morning.
The Belfast-born centre-half was part of the Northern Ireland team that drew 0-0 with England in 1985 to qualify for the World Cup finals.
He won 52 international caps during a club career that also included spells with Charlton and Oxford.
McDonald was best known for his time at Loftus Road, playing more than 400 times for QPR and was in the side which lost the League Cup final to Oxford United at Wembley in 1986.
After retiring he served for a time as a coach with the club and was Northern Ireland's U21 manager before four years in charge at Glentoran.
Former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy, a close friend and former team-mate of McDonald's, said: "I'm shell-shocked. Words can't even enter my head at the moment.
"Forty-eight is so young. Alan was always larger than life - during his career and after.
"I've just spoken to Norman Whiteside and he is devastated."
