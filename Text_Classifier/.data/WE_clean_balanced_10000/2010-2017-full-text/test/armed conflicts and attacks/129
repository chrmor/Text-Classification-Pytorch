Libya rebels close in on Tripoli
Explosions and gunfire rocked Tripoli on Sunday as a months-long uprising reached the Libyan capital with rebel leaders insisting they are near to ending Muammar Gaddafi's almost 42-year rule.
An operation dubbed Mermaid is underway in the capital with the goal of isolating the veteran leader and forcing his surrender or departure, a rebel spokesman told AFP.
With rebels claiming to have seized three key towns and saying they are advancing on Tripoli from the west, the veteran leader urged supporters to "march by the millions" to liberate cities held by "traitors and rats."
Intermittent gunfire crackled in Tripoli on Sunday morning after four strong blasts were heard shortly after 4am local time (1200 AEST) as NATO warplanes flew overhead, an AFP journalist said.
The targets were not immediately identifiable but witnesses reported clashes in several districts between insurgents and Gaddafi supporters, namely in the eastern neighbourhoods of Soug Jomaa, Arada and Tajura.
Government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim admitted there were "small clashes" that lasted 30 minutes but stressed the pro-regime volunteers and Gaddafi forces repelled insurgents who had "infiltrated" the capital.
