Taylor Swift fails to get nominated for MTV Video Music Awards
If seeing Taylor Swift win an MTV Video Music Award was a squad goal for the Swifties of the world, it’s not going to happen this year. The platinum-locked pop star failed to garner any nominations, FoxNews.com reportedWednesday, even as both an old flame and a feuding partner got nods from the network.
Miss Swift’s ex-boyfriend, Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, is vying for two of the music-video network’s iconic astronaut statuettes, one of which, Fox News noted, is for “This Is What You Came For,” which Miss Swift co-wrote under the pen name Nils Sjöberg.
Meanwhile Kanye West was nominated under two categories for the music video for “Famous,” the infamous song at the heart of a social-media fight between the rapper and Miss Swift, who insists she did not consent to being referred to as a “bitch” in the song. In the video itself, a topless Swift lookalike is depicted — among other undressed celebrity doppelgangers — in bed with Mr. West. 
While Miss Swift won’t have fresh hardware for her trophy case come the evening of Aug. 28 when the VMAs are held, earlier this month the singer-songwriter was honored at the BMI Pop Awards in May with a new accolade named in her honor, the Taylor Swift Award.
“Swift’s eponymous award, in recognition of her creative and artistic talent and influence, marked only the second time in BMI’s 76-year history that the organization has presented an award in an artist’s name,” Billboard reported at the time.
Mr. West kicks off his Saint Pablo Tour three days before the VMAs on Aug. 25 in Indianapolis and wraps it up on Nov. 1 in Los Angeles. Mr. Harris’ performance calendar, comprised mostly of gigs in Las Vegas, runs through mid-September, according to his website. Miss Swift’s next live performance, according to her official website, is not until Oct. 22, in Austin, Texas.
