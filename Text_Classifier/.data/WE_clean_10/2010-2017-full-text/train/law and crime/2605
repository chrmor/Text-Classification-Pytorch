Pressure to arrest top Nazi criminal
HUNGARY is under pressure to prosecute the world's most wanted surviving Nazi war criminal after France demanded that ''there can be no immunity'' for those accused of carrying out the Holocaust.
The French foreign ministry joined Nazi hunters and Jewish community groups in calling on Hungarian prosecutors to arrest Laszlo Csatary, 97, for his role in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to Auschwitz.
''We believe that Nazi criminals, wherever they are, must answer for their acts before justice,'' a spokesman for the French foreign ministry said.
Csatary, who tops the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most-wanted list of Nazi war criminals, was discovered living in Budapest under his own name.
He had been living in Canada but left when he was found by investigators in 1995.
