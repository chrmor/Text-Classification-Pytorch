Mexican president hits back at Donald Trump over border wall but White House summit is still on ... 'for now'
The first order is the border security and immigration enforcement improvements. It addresses long overdue border security issues and it's the first order of -- order in that will be to build a large physical barrier on the southern border. Building this barrier is more than just a campaign promise, it's a common sense first step to really securing our porous border. This will stem the flow of drugs, crime, illegal immigration into the United States. And yes, one way or another, as the president has said before, Mexico will pay for it.
The executive order also provides the dedicated men and women of the Department of Homeland Security with the tools they need -- the tools and the resources they need to stop illegal immigration from the -- entering the United States.
Under the Constitution, the America people get the final say who can and cannot enter our nation, and they've spoken loud and clearly through our laws. We're going to create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier and cheaper to detain them and return them to their country of origin. We're going to end the last administration's dangerous catch and release policy, which has led to the deaths of many Americans.
We're going to once again prioritize the prosecution and deportation of illegal immigrants who have also otherwise violated our laws. And after these criminals spend time in prison for the crimes they've committed, they're gonna get one-way tickets to the country of their origin and their governments are gonna take them back.
