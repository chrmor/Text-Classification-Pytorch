White supremacist Eugene Terreblanche murder trial to begin
The two workers – Chris Mahlangu, 29, and a 16-year-old – face charges of hacking to death the co-founder of the far-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) at his farm house outside the northwest town of Ventersdorp on April 3, 2010.
The two handed themselves in to police after the killing, saying they had fought with their employer over pay, which reportedly was 300 rand (£26) a month.
Their trial was set down for December but was twice postponed because of changes in lawyers for the defence, leaving presiding judge John Horn irritated with "time wasted" in a case that has dragged on for a year and a half.
The two will stand trial together over 10 days, although the teenager will be tried as a minor. He was 15 at the time of the killing and cannot be identified under South African law.
The 68-year-old Terreblanche's head was beaten with a knob-headed stick, and a machete was found still embedded in his flesh.
The initial court appearances drew hundreds of AWB supporters, clad in khaki uniforms bearing swastika-like symbols, who argued and shouted with hundreds of black people who had also gathered outside the courtroom. The scenes conjured images of South Africa's apartheid past and raised fears of racial attacks, 17 years after the end of white rule, with President Jacob Zuma personally appealing for calm in the nation.
