Two arrested after climbing Shannon Airport fence
Two people were arrested today after scaling the perimeter fence at Shannon Airport.
Air Traffic Control alerted gardaí and airport police to the presence of a 59-year-old man and a 78-year-old woman on a runway at around 4pm this afternoon.
It is understood they were protesting over the use of the airport by the US military.
Today marks the 11th anniversary of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan.
Both were arrested and taken to Shannon Garda Station.
They were released without charge and gardaí say a file is to be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.
There was no disruption to flights at the airport.
