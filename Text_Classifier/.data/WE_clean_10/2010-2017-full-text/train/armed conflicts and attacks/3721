DAMASCUS, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 58 civilians were killed and over 200 others wounded by Syrian airstrikes against a rebel bastion east of the capital Damascus on Sunday, a monitor group reported.
The Syrian warplanes fired several missiles against the sprawling suburb of Douma, in the eastern countryside of Damascus, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It added that the death toll could likely rise due to the large number of critically wounded people.
The attack also left property losses in Douma, the main stronghold of the so-called Jaish al-Islam, or the Islam Army, in the Eastern Ghouta countryside of Damascus.
Some missiles struck a marketplace in that area, the UK-based watchdog group added.
Meanwhile, the state news agency SANA said the Syrian air force targeted the "terrorists" positions in Eastern Ghouta, destroying rocket launchers, weapons depots, and killing many "terrorists" most of whom were foreigners.
Throughout the country's long-running conflict, Douma has emerged as the main stronghold of an array of jihadist groups in eastern Damascus, mainly the Islam Army.
