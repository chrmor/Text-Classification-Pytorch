Thousands, including families, children, and miners from around the country, march from Knottingley to North Yorkshire to mark the end of deep coal mining in the United Kingdom. The last facility, Kellingley Colliery in Beal, North Yorkshire, closed down, Friday, 18 December 2015. The march was organized by two miners' wives to pay tribute to this industry.
