HAVANA—Pope Francis met Cuban President Raúl Castro and his predecessor and brother Fidel Castro on Sunday, shortly after dissidents said they were detained to prevent them from attending a papal Mass in the capital.
The events of the pontiff’s first full day in Cuba served as a reminder of the challenges in creating meaningful political change on the island after more than five decades of single-party rule.
