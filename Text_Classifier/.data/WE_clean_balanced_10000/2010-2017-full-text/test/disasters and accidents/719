Solomon Islands hit by another strong earthquake; no immediate reports of injuries or damage
Another powerful earthquake has struck the Solomon Islands, the second strong temblor of the day to hit the South Pacific country.
The magnitude-7.7 quake struck at 11:36 p.m. local time Sunday, with an epicenter 328 kilometers (204 miles) southeast of Honiara, the capital, and a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
On Sunday morning, a magnitude-7.6 quake in the same area triggered large waves in the Solomon Islands.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from either quake.
Following the first earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled a tsunami warning after issuing an alert for some Pacific islands.
The Solomon Islands was already reeling from flash floods that struck April 3, killing 23 people and leaving 9,000 homeless.
