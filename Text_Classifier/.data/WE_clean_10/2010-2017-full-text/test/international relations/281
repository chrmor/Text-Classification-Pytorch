Turkish Foreign Minister Welcomes House Failure to Schedule Genocide Bill
ISTANBUL (WorldBulletin)—Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Thursday evening hailed a decision by the US House leadership to forgo a vote of the Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.252) for the final session of the 111th Congress.
“We are pleased that a development that would be a blow to the balance in the Caucasus and Turkish-American and Turkish-Armenian relations did not happen in the U.S. Congress,” Davutoglu said. “Common sense prevailed yesterday.”
Davutoglu said Ankara was closely monitoring the developments as they unfolded and thanked the “U.S. administration, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other executives for their efforts” against the resolution.
“This incident once again proved that assessment of historical incidents by political authorities is principally wrong. Turkey’s stance on this issue is fairly apparent. We are ready for every kind of confrontation and every kind of study,” he said. “However, we cannot accept use of those historical incidents as blackmail towards our country and it is not true to revive historical issues like the sword of Damocles swinging on Turkish-U.S. relations.”
Davutoglu said Turkey hopes to “endeavor for positive diploma efforts with U.S. leaders in the coming days to prevent a possible crisis.”
“It is obvious that initiatives of this kind lead to waste of energy and time. It is time for dialogue, meetings and agreement,” Davutoglu said. “We are obliged to intensify efforts reciprocally and prevail peace and dialogue in the whole world.”
Davutoglu underscored “once again that efforts to put pressure on Turkey via representatives who are unaware of the issue would remain inconclusive and harm Turkish-U.S. and Turkish-Armenian relations. We hope that such initiatives would not be brought to the agenda in the coming days.”
