The Court of Appeals of the Philippines has junked U.S. Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton's motion for reconsideration, re-affirming its decision last April upholding the 2015 homicide ruling of the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court; citing the defendant's arguments as mere "rehash of issues". The Court of Appeals also upheld the payment of â‚± 4.32 million to Jennifer Laude's family for "loss of earning capacity". Pemberton faces 10 years in prison. (Rappler)
