Tibetan sets self on fire in Nepal, critical
A Tibetan monk in his early 20s is said to be critical after he set himself on fire on Wednesday in another case of self-immolation to protest Chinese rule in Tibet.
The incident took place around 8.50 am near Kathmandu's Boudhanath monastery, which is a shrine and residence for many Tibetan refugees. It was reported to be the 100th case of self-immolation and the second one outside Tibet in the past four years.
Few details were available about the man. Doctors at the Kathmandu Teaching University Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment, said he had suffered about 90 per cent burns and chances of his survival were low.
The police near the monastery rushed to the scene after the monk set himself on fire. They cordoned off the area after the incident and checked cameras and mobile phones of passers-by to stop the incident from gaining more publicity.
