Rochester, NY cancels fireworks after New Year's Eve attack plot
Officials in Rochester have canceled a New Year's Eve fireworks celebration following the arrest of a man federal officials said had planned an attack on a New York bar to prove he was worthy of joining the Islamic State group.
Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren said at a news conference Thursday evening that the cancellation would allow police to redeploy about three dozen officers to patrol the city.
Warren said officials have no reason to believe there is a threat to the public. Other festivities in the city, including an ice skating event, will go on as planned Thursday night.
Earlier Thursday, 25-year-old Emanuel Lutchman was charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Prosecutors said the self-professed convert to Islam planned to use knives and machetes in the attack.
