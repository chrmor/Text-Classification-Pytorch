John Isner wins quickly this time
We'll live-blog Day 2 of the tennis from Wimbledon. (Broadcast on ESPN2.)
3:32: The John Isner-Nicolas Mahut showdown just wasn't close this time around. It also was more than 9 hours quicker, lasting only 2 hours and 3 minutes. Mahut hurt himself with 6 doubel faults and 16 unforced errors. Isner had 41 winners to 31 for Mahut. Neither fired up the killer serve, as they had 8 aces apiece. Isner did have a few more boomers, however, with a top speed of 134 mph, compared to Mahut's best of 112.
3:30: Mahut goes long with a forehand and Isner wins the tie-breaker, 8-6, to take the match in straight sets.
3:29: Isner sets up match point with a service return right on the line. But on his first serve he gives the point back by netting a backhand volley. 6-6 in the tie-break.
3:26: Isner digs down for an ace and goes up 5-4 in the tie-breaker. They have eight aces apiece.
3:25: Isner goes long with a volley and Mahut holds his serves for a 4-3 lead.
3:23: Isner takes care of business on his serve, and leads 3-2.
3:22: Mahut takes a 2-1 lead in the tie-breaker. The next two serves belong to Isner.
3:20: Isner is up 6-5 in the third set, with Mahut serving. Isner takes his third and final challenge, and loses again, for 30-30. Mahut closes out the game, and we're into a second tie-breaker. Isner is up 2-0 on sets.
3:17: Sharapova rattles off four straight games and claims the second to win the match, 6-2, 6-1. So much for those hiccups with her serve, which caused three double faults. She put that aside in easy fashion.
3:14: Mahut holds serve with an ace to put their third set at 5-5. Isner had two challenges during that game and lost both.
3:09: Isner holds serve and leads the third set 5-4.
3:07: Isner gets the break back, thanks to a Mahut double fault that opened the door. The third set is now 4-4, with Isner serving.
3:03: Sharapova breaks back and goes up 2-1 in the second set. The third game ends on a sour note, as Chakvetadze asks for a challenge, but the chair umpire says the request came too late.
3:00: Mahut up 4-2 in the third set.
2:55: What did we tell you about the wind wreaking havoc with Sharapova's tossup for her serve? She's had three double faults, including one that just cost her a break. She's at 1-1 in the second set.
2:50: Mahut comes alive and is moving much better now. He gets three quick points against Isner's serve, and then nails the break on his first opportunity to go up 2-1 in the third set.
2:49: Sharapova coasts through the first set, 6-2, and is up 1-0 in the second quickly.
2:44: The first two sets in the Isner-Mahut match have gone quickly, in 1 hour and 13 minutes. Then again, their marathon match last year got through the first two sets in 1:01, and then the battle began.
2:40: Mahut holds off two break points but can't handle the third one, and goes long with a forehand. Isner wins the second set without going to the tie-breaker, 6-2. So far, Mahut just doesn't look like the imposing player he was last year. His serve hasn't been at all fearsome.
2:36: Sharapova has maintained her break advantage and leads Chakvetadze 4-2 in the first set.
2:34: Mahut and Isner hold serve and Isner's lead is at 5-2 in the second. Crunch time could be arriving sooner than anyone imagined in the rematch.
2:29: Isner holds serve and goes up 4-1 in the second set. This match is about 9 hours ahead of pace from their last one.
2:27: Mahut's double-fault presents Isner with a break-point opportunity. Then Mahut goes long. Isner goes up 3-1 in the second set and is in command.
2:24: Sharapova gets the early break and goes up 2-1 in the first set.
2:22: One thing to watch in the Sharapova match is that the wind has been gusting. That was a factor in her semifinal loss at the French Open. Her serve can be undone by the wind, because she goes for such a high toss.
2:18: Maria Sharapova is in the other headline match that's under way, on Court 1, against fellow Russian Anna Chakvetadze. Chakvetadze has been ranked as high as No. 5 in the world, but her match record this year is only 3-7. That's in part because she has been suffering dizzy spells. Another factor may be that she's still dealing with the aftermath of being a victim in a home invasion.
2:15: Mahut goes long with a backhand and Isner claims the first-set tie-breaker, 7-4. That took about 47 minutes. Anyone think this will last another 10 hours or so, like last time?
2:13: Isner gets to 6-1 with a drop volley. But Mahut saves two set points with his serves. Isner barely got a racket on the last two.
2:10: Isner grabs a 4-1 lead in the tie-breaker. Mahut went long with a backhand and then netted a smash.
2:06: Isner and Mahut are into their first tie-breaker. But only three aces apiece so far.
1:58: Still on serve in the first set of Mahut-Isner. Mahut is leading 5-4. For the record, this is the third time they've played, and they've split so far.
1:43: Here's a surprise. Isner and Mahut have both held serve so far, and the first set is at 2-2. Get ready for some tie-breakers.
1:24: The one marquee player left to go on court is Maria Sharapova. She'll face another Russian, Anna Chakvetakze, on Court 1, but it might be awhile. Robin Soderlin and Philipp Petzschner are in their second set there.
1:17: Ferrer completes his victory against Paire. That clears Court 3 for the Isner-Mahut sequel. They'll start warmups in a couple of minutes and then get going.
1:14: Blake's comeback hopes are dashed. Down 5-4 in the fifth set he has his serve broken by Baghdatis and is out of the tournament. Still have to give Blake credit for forcing five sets after losing the first two.
1:05: If you're waiting on the John Isner-Nicolas Mahut rematch, it's next up on Court 3. David Ferrer is close to closing out a victory there against Benoit Paire.
1:00: Oops. Blake has his comeback stalled as he gets his serve broken. That puts him at 3-3 in the fifth set.
12:57: James Blake has a great comeback in progress. He dropped the first two sets against Marcos Baghdatis but claimed the next two and is up 3-2 in the fifth.
12:45: Djokovic finally gives up a couple of points on serve, but still closes out the first set 6-4, against Jeremy Chardy.
12:43: Top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki no doubt will be pestered throughout the tournament about how she can be ranked No. 1 in the world despite never winning a grand slam event. That sentiment gained some steam today when Jelena Jankovic was dumped in the first round by Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. Jankovic is a former No. 1 who never lived up to the billing in the slams. Her only trip to a final ended with a loss at the 2008 U.S. Open. She was never better than a semifinalist at the French and Australian Opens and the furthest she has gone at Wimbledon is the fourth round.
12:30: Novak Djokovic hasn't loss a point on serve yet while going 4-4 against Jeremy Chardy in the first set. He's been a bazooka out there so far.
12:08: The forecast says there's still a 60% chance of rain in London today, but right now the skies look pretty clear. So maybe Wimbledon will get through Day 2 without suffering another rain delay.
11:52: After working hard to claim the first two sets Federer breezes through the third against Kukushkin, 6-2, and moves on to the second round.
11:47: Wozniacki completes her demolition of the Spaniard and moves on to the second round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory. She's guaranteed to retain her No. 1 world ranking into August, but that status will be questioned until she wins her first major.
11:39: No. 1-seeded Caroline Wozniacki is minutes away from defeating Spain's Arantxa Parra Santonja. She won the first set 6-2 and leads in the second, 5-0. The star from Denmark had been enjoying wearing a jersey of Liverpool soccer player Steven Gerrard when she warms up. But Wimbledon has strict white-only rules on apparel, so she's out of luck in London.
11:27: Federer takes the second set, 6-4. He finished off the set with a 40-0 game. Looks like the wind is kicking up a bit.
11:11: Federer goes up a break in the second set, then holds off two break points and goes up 4-2.
10:52: Here's the link to Serena Williams' tearful interview with BBC, on You Tube.
10:46: Federer fires two aces to close out the tie-breaker, 7-2.
10:42: Federer does indeed go to a tie-breaker in the first set.
10:37: Federer appears headed for a tie-breaker in his first set, against Mikhail kukushkin. Federer leads 6-5, and they're on serve.
10:24: Roddick closes out the final set with absolute ease and wins his opening match, 6-4, 7-6, 6-3, then gives a wave to wife Brooklyn Decker in the friends box.
10:17: Roddick is still up a break in the third set, 4-3.
10:06: Roddick is rolling in the third set, up 3-2.
10:01: Roddick wins the tie-break and has a chance to win in straight sets.
9:55: Serena, talking to BBC, with red eyes, and still shedding some tears: "I usually don't cry. It's just been so hard. I just wanted to win at least one match here . . . It's been a disaster year, but I've been praying, I have my family . . . To come back at Wimbledon is just awesome."
9:49: Serena wins third set 6-1. While she didn't want to go three sets, Williams came out smoking and put Rezai away and then breaks out into tears of relief.
9:45: Serena serving for match up 5-1 in third set. Roddick serving for tie break. He doesn't get it. It is 6-6.
9:43: Roddick's challenge on a second serve allows him to stay 4-4 in the tie break but then Beck hammers a winner off Roddick forehand.
9:40: Serena up 4-1 in third set. Roddick and Beck 3-3 in second set tie break.
9:36: Williams up 3-2 in the third set now. Players are on serve. Roddick and Beck now going to tie-break in the second set.
9:33: Roddick goes up 6-5 in second set. His serve has saved him as Beck is outplaying him in most volleys. But its a pretty dominating serve. Serena and Rezai are at 1-1 in the third set.
9:30: Serena Williams up 1-0 in the third set. Beck has just tied Roddick 5-5 in the second set as he ripped four winners leaving Roddick completely flat-footed.
9:27: Roddick goes up 5-4 in second set as he unleashes a couple of fastballs. He has 20 aces including two in the just completed game.
9:23: Roddick and Beck are 4-4 in second set with Roddick now serving.
9:22: Rezai wins the second set 6-3 and Serena Williams will have to prove that her work with trainer Mackie Shilstone is going to pay off. She did not want to have to be extended to three sets in her first match back.
9:20: Williams wins game to make it 5-3 with Rezai serving to win set.
9:17: Beck and Roddick are 3-3 in second set after Roddick won the first.
9:15: Rezai is now dominating the second set. She is up 5-2 with Serena Williams serving. The defending champion is being moved all over the court by Rezai who would have a great chance in a three-set match.
9:14: A double-fault by Williams gives Rezai a 4-2 lead in the second set. This could get interesting if Williams, after an 11-month layoff, has to go three sets.
9:10: Roddick, who has 15 aces already, easily wins the fifth game and leads 3-2 in the second set. So far in power vs. finesse, Roddick's power is giving him the edge. Serena Williams still can't shake Rezai and is down 3-2 in the second set. Rezai is moving Williams around the court and making her look uncomfortable.
9:04: Drop shots by Beck and missed shots by Beck ties the second set at 2-2. Williams and Rezai are also 2-2 in the second set after Serena won the first set.
9:02: Rezai now up 2-1 in the second set with Williams having won the first set 6-3.
8:58: Roddick and Beck continue to hold serve with Roddick up 2-1 in the second set after winning first set 6-4.
8:55: Good start for Roddick who won first set 6-4 and is up 1-0 in the second against Beck. Williams is down 0-1 in her second set.
8:47: With Diana Ross in attendance, it is Williams with all the big hits (please excuse us for that one) as she wins the first set 6-3.
8:45: Rezai keeps herself in the match winning serve and make it 5-3. Serena serving for the set.
8:40: Williams now has three foot-faults but is otherwise dominating Rezai. She's up 5-2 and sealed the latest game with an ace. Meanwhile, Roddick leads Beck 4-3 in the first set.
8:38: Rezai double-faults twice and has an awful time with her first serve to allow Williams to stay in the sixth game and then win after getting it to deuce. Her drop shot to put her up 4-2 also was the first sign of emotion from Williams as she pumps her fist.
8:32: Williams, now looking loose, is serving big and dominating Rezai. And she's up 3-2 in the match after an ace to seal the latest game. She has won 12 of 14 points.
8:30: Williams has broken Rezai to make it 2-2. Williams, shaky at the start, has won 8 of the past 9 points and is now serving.
8:27: Andy Roddick is up 3-2 in his match against Andreas Beck. Each man is holding serve.
8:25: Much better effort from Serena Williams as she wins the third game easily. She is down 2-1 to Rezai but barely gave her opponent to opportunity. Now she has to get back on serve.
8:23: Rezai, whose best Wimbledon effort is a third-round ouster in 2007, is now up 2-0 on Serena. She beat Venus for a title last year in Madrid.
8:20: Williams does indeed lose her serve and the first game to Rezai. The problems thus far include a shaky first serve and some missed opportunities that appear to be from lack of action.
8:17: The opening game is in fourth deuce for Williams who probably hoped to get off to a better start. She definitely doesn't want to lose her opening serve who has two foot faults.
8:15: Analyst Dick Enberg said Williams has four Wimbledon titles and Rezai has four titles overall. And the rust begins to fall as she won a long volley to go ad in. Of course as soon as we write that she hits into the net to go deuce again.
8:12: Williams now down 30-40 just got her first ace but she doesn't look ultra sharp.
8:08: Serena is not copying her sister Venus' pantsuit look from Monday. She seems to be satisfied with the semi-traditional white dress. Of course more important will be here physical and mental make-up. She opened up on serve and missed a wide-open shot to go down 0-15.
8:01: Defending champion Serena Williams is just minutes away from beginning her match with Aravane Rezai. Venus Williams won her opening match easily on Monday and Serena is expected to cruise. However, she is returning from a layoff due to an injured foot and other medical aliments that included a blood clot.
