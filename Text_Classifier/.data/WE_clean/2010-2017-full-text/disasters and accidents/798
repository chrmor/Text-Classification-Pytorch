Bus crash in Philippines kills 39
(CNN) -- A minibus plunged into a 100-meter deep ravine in the Philippines' Benguet province Wednesday morning, killing 39 people, a fire official told CNN.
The passenger bus with 47 people on board was headed to San Fernando City in La Union when it crashed, said Fire Officer Joseph Cortes.
An initial investigation showed faulty brakes might have triggered the accident, Cortes said.
The crash was near where another minibus fell years ago. In that crash, more than 20 people were killed, the Philippines News Agency said.
