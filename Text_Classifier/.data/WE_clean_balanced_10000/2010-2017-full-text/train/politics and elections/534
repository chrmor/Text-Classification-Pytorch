The 10/10/10 Global Work Party Kicks Off
We're sitting here in the temporary 350.org HQ in Washington, DC watching photos stream in from all over the world. They're all a part of today's 10/10/10 Global Work Party, the biggest day of climate action in the planet's history.
About half of the 7,000 events in 188 countries have taken place already. People greeted the sunrise in New Zealand, raced to clean up trash in Beijing, planted thousands of mangroves in the Philippines, installed solar panels in South Africa and Namibia, marched by the thousands in Istanbul, and more.
The best news? There's still much more to come. All around the world, across race and nation, we're sending a clear message to our politicians: we're getting to work, now it's your turn.
Take a look at some of the photos and please help spread the word:
