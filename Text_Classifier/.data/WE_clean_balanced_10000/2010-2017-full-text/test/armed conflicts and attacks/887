TEHRAN (FNA)- The Saudi army is now on full alert after the US-led West increased the level of its threats and said it would launch a strike on Syria in the next few days.
The Saudi army ground force operations command center has ordered all its military units to stand level 2 alert, the Arabic-language Al-Ahd news website reported.
The Saudi army has also ordered all its units to send daily reports to their command centers on their status of alert after executing the above order.
The development came after senior American officials said the United States has planned to launch missile strikes against Syria "as early as Thursday" on the pretext of the alleged use of chemical weapons near the capital, Damascus last week.
The unnamed officials told NBC News on Tuesday that the "three days" of strikes would be limited in scope, and aimed at "sending a message to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad".
On Monday night, four US warships were deployed in the Mediterranean Sea within cruise missile range of Syria.
American defense officials said if the US wants to send a message to Assad, the most likely military action would be a Tomahawk missile strike, launched from a ship in the Mediterranean.
The US military has beefed up equipment during the past weeks. Several nuclear-powered submarines are reportedly in the water near Syria, also cruise-missile equipped.
The report came one day after US Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem on Tuesday accused Kerry of lying about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, challenging Washington and its allies to provide evidence.
This is while the UN inspectors are still in Syria to investigate the chemical weapons attacks and they are not scheduled to leave the country until Sunday.
Iran, Russia and China have all warned against a US-led military intervention in Syria.
