Kuwait sentences two to death over ‘spying for Iran’
A Kuwaiti court on Tuesday handed down death the penalty to two convicted of espionage with Iran and Hezbollah.
The case also included the possession of weapons. One of the men given the death penalty was an Iranian convicted in absentia as well as another Kuwaiti.
The pair were convicted along with 24 other Kuwaitis, one of whom was sentenced to life in prison.
Nineteen others were jailed for between five and 15 years. Three were acquitted and one was fined.
Kuwaiti authorities said in August they had dismantled an Iran-linked cell and seized large quantities of arms, explosives and ammunition.
The verdicts come amid deep tensions between Tehran and Gulf Arab states after Iranian protesters on January 2 torched Saudi  diplomatic missions in Islamic republic.
