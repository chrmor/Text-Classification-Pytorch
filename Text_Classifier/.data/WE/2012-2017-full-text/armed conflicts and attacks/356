Egyptians march on Defense Ministry
CAIRO, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Egyptian protesters said Friday during marches on the Defense Ministry they wanted the military authority to hand power to a civilian administration.
Egyptians have continued to express frustration with the pace at which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is relinquishing power roughly one year after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted during a popular uprising.
Anti-SCAF demonstrators gathered following Friday prayers to march on the building housing the Egyptian Defense Ministry, Egyptian news agency al-Ahram reports.
Similar protests turned violent last year when demonstrators clashed with security forces. The Egyptian news service reports that the ministry is surrounded by military forces, armored vehicles and concrete walls.
The report added, however, that sermons for Friday prayers were conflicted on whether continued protests would change the dynamic on post-revolution Egypt. More protests are planned for Saturday.
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party leads the country's new Parliament alongside the Islamist al-Nour party. Egyptians start vetting presidential candidates next month, though Muslim Brotherhood officials said they won't field a candidate.
