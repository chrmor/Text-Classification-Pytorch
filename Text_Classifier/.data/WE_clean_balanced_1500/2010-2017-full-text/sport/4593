IAAF votes overwhelmingly to ban Russia for doping
Calling it a wake-up call for a sport in a "shameful" position, IAAF president Sebastian Coe said Russia would be banned from next year's Olympics unless it convinces the world it has cleaned up its act.
The sport's governing body provisionally suspended Russia's track and field federation, four days after the country was accused of operating a vast state-sponsored doping program in a report by a World Anti-Doping Agency commission.
The move bars Russia from international track and field competition for an indefinite period, including the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, until the country is judged to have fixed its problems and fallen into line with global anti-doping rules.
Coe called the decision – approved 22-1 in a secret vote of the IAAF council via teleconference – "the toughest sanction we can apply at this time". It's the first time the International Association of Athletics Federations has ever banned a country over its doping failures.
