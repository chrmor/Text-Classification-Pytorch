South African mall collapses leaving 50 trapped, 1 dead
Durban: One person has died and as many as 50 workers are feared trapped after the roof of an under-construction mall collapsed near the South African city of Durban.
One person has been confirmed dead and at least 26 people have been pulled from the rubble, Police spokeswoman Mandy Govender says.
"It was a mall building still under construction," said Ms Govender. "Most of those still trapped inside the building were construction workers."
An eThekwini municipality fire official says emergency teams are working to prevent further collapses at the site.
"There is work in progress to try and stabilise the situation," he said, refusing to give his name because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
