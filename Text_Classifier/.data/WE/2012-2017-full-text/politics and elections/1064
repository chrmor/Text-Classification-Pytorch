Miguel de la Madrid dies at 77; former president of Mexico
"I do not think Mexico has ever had an easy time," De la Madrid told Time magazine in a 1985 interview. "If we look back over history, we will see that it was only from the 1950s until the end of the 1970s that we enjoyed continuous expansion. The rest of our history has been difficult."
