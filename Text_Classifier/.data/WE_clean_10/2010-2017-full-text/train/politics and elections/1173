Irish PM Brian Cowen tells party he will not resign
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen has said that he is not resigning as leader of Ireland's ruling Fianna Fail party.
His position has been the subject of intense speculation over the past 24 hours.
Speaking after a meeting of his parliamentary party, Mr Cowen acknowledged there were "issues" surrounding his leadership.
Correspondents say some members are angry about his handling of Ireland's economy and its international bailout.
"I haven't considered resigning. I haven't said to anybody that I am stepping down," Mr Cowen told state broadcaster RTE.
"I am committed to leading this party. There is no vacancy."
There had been speculation that party members might table a vote of no confidence in Mr Cowen at the meeting on Thursday - and that he might resign the leadership before a vote.
But correspondents say Mr Cowen successfully appealed to them to hold fire for a few days at least.
He told RTE he would talk to colleagues individually to discuss what was in the party's best interests.
Mr Cowen has been under pressure since Ireland was forced last year to seek an international financial bail-out.
The current crisis was sparked by reports that Mr Cowen had met senior officials from Anglo-Irish Bank before it was nationalised.
The bank collapsed and its former chairman Sean Fitzpatrick has been questioned by police about his role.
Mr Fitzpatrick has previously been arrested by police investigating the downfall of the bank and is still the subject of official scrutiny.
A book recently revealed that Mr Cowen met him for dinner at a golf course in 2008.
However, the prime minister has denied that he discussed bank matters and insisted that he had not done political favours for any financial institution.
Mr Cowen, who took power in 2008, has faced severe criticism over his government's handling of the banking crisis and the subsequent recession.
Last month, there were rumours of an internal push against him but his critics pulled back at the last moment.
His coalition government has only a slim minority in parliament and a general election is expected in the spring.
