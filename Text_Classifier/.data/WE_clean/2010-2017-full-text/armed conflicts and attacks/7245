Tripoli pounded, Colonel Gaddafi's Libya home rocked
POWERFUL explosions have again rocked the area around the residence of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the centre of Tripoli, only hours after it had been targeted by dozens of similar raids.
Loud blasts were heard today in the district around 1.45am local time (9.45am AEST). A little later the city was shaken by more powerful explosions.
Today, in one of the heaviest bombardments of the air war so far, NATO-led warplanes carried out some 60 strikes on Tripoli, killing 31 people, Libyan government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said.
A main target was Colonel Gaddafi's compound which has been targeted regularly since the start of the international military intervention on March 19, and most of the buildings in the Bab al-Aziziya complex have been flattened.
