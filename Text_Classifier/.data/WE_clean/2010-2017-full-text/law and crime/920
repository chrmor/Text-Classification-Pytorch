Judge seeks doctor for paralysis punishment
A SAUDI judge has asked several hospitals whether they could damage a man's spinal cord as punishment after he was convicted of attacking another man with a cleaver and paralysing him, the brother of the victim says.
Abdul-Aziz al-Mutairi, 22, was left paralysed and subsequently lost a foot after a fight more than two years ago.
He had asked a judge in north-western Tabuk province to impose an equivalent punishment on his attacker under Islamic law, his brother Khaled al-Mutairi said.
He said a hospital in Tabuk responded by saying it was possible to damage the spinal cord, but the operation had to be done at a more specialised facility.
Saudi newspapers reported that a second hospital - in the capital, Riyadh - declined, saying it could not inflict such harm.
Saudi Arabia enforces strict Islamic law and occasionally doles out punishments based on the ancient legal code of an eye for an eye.
