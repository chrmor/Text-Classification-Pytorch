The United States of America has lifted a ban it imposed in October last year on freight flights from Yemen, U.S. ambassador to Yemen said on Saturday.
Cargo flights can now fly to the U.S. without any hindrances but there some conditions and regulations airlines companies including Yemenia Airlines should adhere to transport cargos from Yemen to the U.S., Gerald M. Feierstein said at a meeting with Transport Minister Khalid Al-Wazeer.
"The decision came under the recommendations of the U.S. technical team which visited Yemen to familiarize with air security measures at Yemen's airports after the mail bombs that triggered the ban in October 2010".
The U.S. team found Yemen has already developed its airport security measures to be in accordance with the ICAO standards, the envoy told the minister, as he added that the team urged to lift the ban because there will be no problems with resuming cargo flights from Yemen anymore.
The meeting, according to Saba, dealt with aspects of cooperation between the two countries in the airport security field, with a focus on training the staff of Sana'a International Airport.
Several countries suspended cargos flights from Yemen after the last year's explosive parcels and so far three countries have lifted the bans including the United Arab Emirates.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula AQAP was behind the mail bombs that had been intercepted in Dubai and London before they could reach Chicago in the U.S., to where the parcels were shipped. Â
