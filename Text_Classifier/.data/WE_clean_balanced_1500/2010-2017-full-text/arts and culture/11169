Pilgrims walk Way of Suffering
Christian pilgrims crowded the cobblestone alleyways of Jerusalem's Old City to mark Good Friday.
Thousands of visitors retraced the last steps of Jesus down the Via Dolorosa, Latin for Way of Suffering.
The route ends at the ancient Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered as the site of his crucifixion, burial and resurrection two days later on Easter Sunday.
The calendars of the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches coincide this year, so the sects are marking the Holy Week together. Jews are also celebrating the Passover festival.
Herman Backhaus, from Munster, Germany, says being in Jerusalem reminds him that Jesus ''actually lived, and his message didn't die with him on the cross''.
