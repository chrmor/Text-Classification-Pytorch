New Slovak government wins confidence vote
BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) â€” The new Slovak government of Prime Minister Robert Fico has won a mandatory vote of confidence in Parliament
Tuesday's 79-61 vote came after Fico's leftist Smer-Social Democracy won the March 5 general election with 49 of the 150 seats in Parliament. The party secured a majority government with three other groups: the ultra-nationalist Slovak National Party, the conservative Net party and a party of ethnic Hungarians.
In the past four years, Smer governed alone. It dominates the new government with eight other posts, including the foreign, interior and finance ministries.
The other three parties will have six ministry posts altogether.
Fico campaigned on a strong anti-migrant ticket and favors a welfare state and strong state control of the economy.
Fico is currently hospitalized after undergoing heart surgery last week.
