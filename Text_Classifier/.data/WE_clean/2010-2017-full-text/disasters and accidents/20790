Cyclone Nathan threatening Queensland coast again
Queensland's far north is bracing for Cyclone Nathan for the second time in a week.
The storm intensified to category 2 on Wednesday morning, generating wind gusts of up to 130km/h at its core.
Residents from Coen to Cardwell are expecting heavy rain and winds as strong as 200km/h by the time the system makes landfall on Friday.
But Cook Shire mayor Peter Scott said he was most worried about the prospect of a storm surge adding to already high tides.
