Britain working on plans with allies for a no-fly zone over Libya
British Prime Minister David Cameron says Britain is working with allies on plans for a no-fly zone over Libya, the Associated Press reports.
Cameron did not say whether that meant that the U.K. or its allies are moving to ban Libyan aircraft from flying immediately or simply making plans in case the situation there escalated.
He told British lawmakers Monday that he did not "in any way" rule out the use of military force.
Al-Jazeera TV quotes the former head of Libyan Special Forces as saying he is not ruling out calling in foreign air support but says he does not support the use of foreign ground troops.
