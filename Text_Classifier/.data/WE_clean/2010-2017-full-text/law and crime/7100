Copenhagen bomber gets 12 years in prison
(CNN) -- A Chechen man convicted of trying to send a letter bomb to a Danish newspaper was sentenced Tuesday to 12 years in prison.
A jury in Copenhagen convicted Lors Doukaev, 25, on Monday of attempted terrorism.
Doukaev was arrested after he accidentally set off bomb material in Copenhagen's Hotel Jorgensen in September.
The blast destroyed the bathroom and injured Doukaev, who ran into a nearby park. Police surrounded him in the park and arrested him. A bomb squad later detonated a pouch he had been wearing.
The jury found that Doukaev intended to send a letter bomb to Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which in 2005 published 12 drawings of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed.
The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed.
Doukaev said in court that he had a pistol and a bomb for personal security.
