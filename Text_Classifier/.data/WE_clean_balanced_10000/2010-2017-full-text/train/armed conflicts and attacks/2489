Turkey sets up $100 mln fund to help Libya rebels
ABU DHABI, June 9 (Reuters) - Turkey has established a $100 million fund to support Libya’s rebel Transitional National Council, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Thursday.
“There is a real need for humanitarian access as well as for the natural needs of Libya like schools, hospitals and all those facilities,” Davutoglu said.
Davutoglu was speaking to reporters at a summit of Western and Arab countries backing Libya’s rebels and aimed at preparing for a political structure after the departure of leader Muammar Gaddafi from power.
