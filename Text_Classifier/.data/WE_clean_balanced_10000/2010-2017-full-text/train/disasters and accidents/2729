Lead poisoning kills 400 kids in Nigeria
Lead poisoning has killed more than 400 children under five in the past six months in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara, an international humanitarian group said on Tuesday.
"Based on record of fatalities from lead poisoning, more than 400 children have died in the last six months," said El-Shafii Muhammad Ahmad, project director for Medecines Sans Frontieres (MSF).
"But we in MSF believe the figure is much more than that," he told AFP on the phone from Zamfara state.
A lead poisoning epidemic linked to illegal gold mining hit the predominantly Muslim state at the start of the year.
The intoxifications were caused by the illegal extraction of ore by villagers, who would transport crushed rock home from the mines to extract the gold.
The soil containing lead deposits would then be haphazardly disposed of, exposing children to inhalation or ingestion.
