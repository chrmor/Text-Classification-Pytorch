Trump wins 9 delegates in Northern Mariana Islands
Donald Trump has won the Republican caucus in the Northern Mariana Islands, a remote U.S. territory that consists of 15 islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Trump took home 73 percent of the vote and will win all nine delegates,according to Jason Osborne, who was the executive director of the local Republican Party.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz followed behind with 24 percent. Both Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio made barely a blip -- Kasich took 2 percent and Rubio 1 percent of 471 total votes.
Osborne — who is now advising Trump — previously worked as a senior communications adviser to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who endorsed Trump last week.
Last week, the governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, Ralph Torres, threw his support behind Trump.
“I encouraged CNMI GOP voters to come out and exercise their right and vote for their preferred presidential nominee. I am overwhelmed by the turnout and their support for my endorsement of Mr. Donald Trump. I thank all the voters for participating in this important process. The attention the CNMI has received this presidential cycle from all the candidates has truly shown that our votes matter," Torres said in a statement.
Correction: A previous version -- based off an incorrect press release -- of this story misstated Kasich and Rubio's vote totals.
