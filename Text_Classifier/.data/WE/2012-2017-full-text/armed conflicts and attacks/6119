More Killed in Pakistan in Bombings Ahead of Election
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Taliban attacks on election candidates in northwestern Pakistan killed at least eight people and wounded dozens on Sunday, adding to a growing toll of militant violence before elections scheduled for May 11.
A bomb planted outside the office of a Shiite politician in the garrison city of Kohat killed five people, police officials said, while a second explosion near the office of a tribal candidate in the regional capital, Peshawar, killed at least three.
A Taliban spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Neither candidate was wounded.
At least 50 people have died since early April in election-related attacks, mostly carried out by the Taliban, that have damaged public confidence in the elections and underscored the determination of militants to influence the results.
The bloodshed had been concentrated in northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, where the Taliban have vowed to attack rallies organized by the secular-minded Awami National Party, but the violence has spread to other provinces in the past week.
