Mary Keitany Wins 2015 New York City Marathon
Mary Keitany came to the 2015 New York City Marathon as the reigning champion, and she solidly defended her title on Sunday, finishing in 2:24:25.
Keitany, 33, of Kenya, tucked into a pack of 10 women for the first 30K of the race. Sara Moreira, from Portugal, spearheaded the group for much of the way, going through the half marathon in a conservative 1:12:56. It was Keitany’s plan to stick with the leaders until 30K, she indicated after her victory.
“I knew the streets and said, ‘Just wait,’” she said.
Keitany’s patience was a lesson learned the hard way. In 2011, she pressed from the start, accumulating a two-and-a-half-minute lead in the first 15 miles. She eventually faded badly to third.
This year, when Keitany threw in her surge, it was Tigist Tufa and Aselefech Mergia, both from Ethiopia, and Priscah Jeptoo, the 2013 NYC Marathon champion from Kenya, who tried to follow suit. But just one mile later, it was a two-woman race between Keitany and Tufa. Keitany pressed ahead, clocking a 5:12 mile at 35K, the fastest split of her day—and it became her race to lose.
“After 35(K), I was just alone in the street and I kept on going,” Keitany said.
Mergia caught Tufa around the 40K mark to finish second in 2:25:32. Tufa was third in 2:25:50.
“Towards the end I lagged behind because my shoes were uncomfortable and my feet were burning,” Tufa said, through an interpreter.
Keitany is the former world record holder for the half marathon and has a marathon PR of 2:18:37. She won the 2011-12 World Marathon Majors title, then in 2013 gave birth to her second child. 
Her repeat victory, for which she takes home a $130,000 prize, was satisfying.
“To do it twice was really something great for me,” Keitany said.
Laura Thweatt, of Boulder, Colorado, was the first American to finish and ended up seventh overall. In her debut at the distance she ran 2:28:23. Alana Hadley, 18, of Charlotte, North Carolina, did not finish.
