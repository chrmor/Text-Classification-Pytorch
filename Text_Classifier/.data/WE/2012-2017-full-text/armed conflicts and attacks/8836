IDF strikes terror targets in Gaza
The Israeli military launched airstrikes at suspected Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip before dawn on Friday, the army announced. "In response to the rocket fire at Israel, IAF aircrafts targeted overnight a terror activity site and a weapon manufacturing facility in the northern Gaza strip and a weapon storage facility in the southern Gaza Strip," the IDF said. "Direct hits were confirmed." "Israelis cannot be held at the mercy of these hideous terrorists operating from Hamas Gaza Strip," an IDF spokesperson said. "The bases of Gaza terrorism and its industry of death will not be immune while our citizens are being attacked. It is our responsibility, right and obligation to defend Israel from Gaza based aggression."
