Firefight in Sudan’s Darfur Kills Three People, UN Reports
Three people were killed in an exchange of fire in Sudan’s western region of Darfur between the government and a rebel group, the United Nations-led peacekeeping mission said.
The UN “continues to investigate” the Jan. 7 clash in Tabit, a village in North Darfur state that involved the Sudan Liberation Movement rebel faction led by Minni Minawi, according to an e-mailed statement today.
About 30,000 people have been displaced in fighting which escalated last month between the Sudanese government and the rebel group, the statement said.
Violence in Darfur exploded in 2003 when rebels took up arms, accusing the authorities in the Sudanese capital Khartoum of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7 million people to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.
