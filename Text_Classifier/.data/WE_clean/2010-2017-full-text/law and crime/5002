Ariz. border vigilante sentenced to death
Arizona border vigilante Shawna Forde has been sentenced to death for the 2009 murders of a 9-year-old girl and her father during a robbery to fund her militia.
Forde, 43, of Everett, Wash., becomes the third woman on the state's death row.
Last week, a Tucson jury convicted her of two counts of first-degree murder for the slayings of Raul "Junior" Flores and his daughter Brisenia in their home near the Mexico border in May 2009.
She was also found guilty of one count of attempted murder for wounding the girl's mother and of assault and robbery. After being shot, the girl's mother wounded one of the attackers, who faces trial with several others.
The Arizona Daily Star writes that Forde "once boasted she was going to takeher Minutemen group to the 'next level.'"
