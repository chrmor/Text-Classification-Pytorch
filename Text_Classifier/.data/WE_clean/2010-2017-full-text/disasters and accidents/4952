Estonia orphanage fire kills 10 children
A fire has raced through an orphanage for disabled children in western Estonia, killing 10 of them.
There were 37 children and nine adults inside the wooden building when the fire started at 2:30pm (2330 AEDT) on Sunday in the coastal town of Haapsalu, said Viktor Saaremets, a spokesman for the Western Estonia Rescue Services Center.
"By the time rescue workers and firefighters arrived at the scene three or four minutes later the building was completely in flames," he said.
Ten children were killed, one adult was injured, Saaremets said.
Most of the victims were wheelchair-bound and were unable to escape the rapidly spreading fire, he said.
The others were evacuated to a nearby building and were not hurt, Saaremets said.
