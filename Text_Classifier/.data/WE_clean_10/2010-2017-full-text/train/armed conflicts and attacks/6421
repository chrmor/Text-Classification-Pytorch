At Least 20 Killed In Baghdad Car Bombings
Reports from Iraq say at least 20 people have been killed in two separate bombings in and around Baghdad.
Police said a car packed with explosives blew up in a commercial street of Baghdad al-Jadeeda (New Baghdad), a mostly Shiâ€™ite neighborhood east of the capital, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 30.
A suicide car bomb also hit the town of Taji, just north of the capital, killing at least five people and wounding at least 12.
There was no immediate claim for the blasts, but the Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for nearly all such attacks in recent months.
The latest bombings comes as Iraqi forces are trying to dislodge IS militants from their stronghold of Fallujah, west of Baghdad.
