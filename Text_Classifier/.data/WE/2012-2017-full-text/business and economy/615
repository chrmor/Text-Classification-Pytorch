Germany's parliament has voted overwhelmingly to endorse a second rescue package for Greece, worth $163 billion.
The decision gives chancellor Angela Merkel approval to ratify the package at a summit of the European Union in Brussels this week.
Before MPs voted, Mrs Merkel warned them that the risks of failing to help Greece avert bankruptcy were incalculable.
