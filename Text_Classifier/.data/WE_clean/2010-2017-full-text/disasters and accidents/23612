Crews are searching for survivors in southeastern Brazil where two iron ore waste dams burst on Thursday.
Dozens are missing and feared dead. Survivors say they had no warning. Some got away by hitching a ride on a truck escaping the flood waters.
The mine is operated by Samarco, a joint venture between mining giants, Brazil’s Vale and Australia’s BHP Billiton. 
The Australian company that runs the mine says it detected seismic activity right before the breach.
