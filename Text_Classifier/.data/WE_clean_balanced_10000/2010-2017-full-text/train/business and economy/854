China's tourism revenue hits $185 billion in 2009
BEIJING: China's tourism industry reaped an revenue of 1.26 trillion yuan (185 billion US dollars) in 2009, up 9 percent year on year, on the back of booming domestic travel.
Domestic tourists made 1.9 billion trips last year, a rise of 11 percent, which generated 1 trillion yuan of revenue for the industry, up 15 percent from a year ago, the National Tourism Administration said on Wednesday.
The number of inbound trips shrank 3 percent to 126 million, as the global financial crisis and the widespread flu epidemic dampened consumer's passion to travel abroad.
As a result, foreign exchanges revenues fell 4.5 percent to 39 billion U.S. dollars.
