Andy Burton dropped by Sky Sports over Sian Massey conversation with Andy Gray
Burton was scheduled to work as Sky Sports' pitchside reporter for Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final second leg between Birmingham City and West Ham United.
However, the broadcaster has now confirmed that Burton will be taken out of the firing line.
In off-air footage recorded on Saturday before Wolves played Liverpool, Burton is seen discussing the appointment of Massey with Gray.
"He [a Sky Sports crew member] says she [Massey] is all right," Burton continued. "Now I don't know if I should trust his judgement on that?"
Gray then said: "No, I wouldn't. I definitely wouldn't ... I can see her from here," before swearing and adding: "What do women know about the offside rule?"
Gray and Richard Keys who were dropped from the Monday night coverage of Chelsea's 4-0 win at Bolton, with Dave Jones presenting the show in their absence.
Sky's next high-profile live match is tomorrow night's Carling Cup clash, but Keys and Gray tend not to front coverage of that particular competition.
With this weekend being the fourth round of the FA Cup, for which Sky do not hold the live rights, the next presenting opportunity for the pair would appear to be the Premier League match between West Brom and Wigan next Tuesday.
Massey, meanwhile, will be back in the spotlight tonight when she runs the line in Crewe's npower League Two game with Bradford.
