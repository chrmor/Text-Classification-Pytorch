Keynote address by Elizabeth Warren highlights DNC schedule Monday
Bernie Sanders has spent months telling voters that his campaign was about the issues, and he used that same argument to tell his supporters to throw their support to Hillary Clinton. 
In his speech Monday, he went step by step through Clinton's proposals, many of which were the product of compromises between the two campaigns. 
For example, Clinton originally supported policies to allow students to attend public colleges debt-free. She later expanded the proposal to include free tuition for most students.
