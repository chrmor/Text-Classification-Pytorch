Ignacio is now a post-tropical cyclone, but is still packing strong winds as a storm system in the North Pacific.
Gov. David Ige signed an emergency proclamation on Friday in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Ignacio.  The storm is forecast to pass north of the Hawaiian Islands Monday night.
National Weather Service (NWS) has advised that even though Ignacio’s track is still highly uncertain, the system has the ability to cause widespread damage across the state.
The proclamation activates the Major Disaster Fund set aside by the Legislature for disaster relief for the entire state. It also allows easier access to emergency resources at the state and federal levels, along with the ability to suspend certain laws as needed for emergency purposes.
"With our whole state engulfed in the cone of uncertainty, we ask the public to continue their preparedness efforts and monitor news media for the latest updates regarding Hurricane Ignacio,” said Vern Miyagi, Executive Officer of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.
The cone of uncertainty presents the probable track of a tropical cyclone and the area over which the center is most likely to pass. The path of the cone can be extremely unpredictable and the center of a storm can fall anywhere within that cone.
