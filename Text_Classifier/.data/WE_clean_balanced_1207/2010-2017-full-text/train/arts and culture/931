Singer Erykah Badu gets probation for stripping
Soul and R&B singer Erykah Badu has paid a fine and will serve six months probation for stripping off her clothes to film a music video Dallas, Texas, at the site where former President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a city official said on Tuesday.
The 39-year-old music star had been charged with disorderly conduct in April over her nude video shoot in Dealey Plaza for her single "Window Seat," from her latest album "New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh).
Badu agreed with prosecutors in her hometown of Dallas to serve probation that will end February 11, and she paid a $500 fine late last week, a spokesman for the city of Dallas said.
In "Window Seat," Badu sheds all her clothes throughout the course of the song as she walks and runs through the plaza. At the end, a gunshot rings out and she collapses to the ground naked, as blue blood spills out to form the word "groupthink."
Kennedy was shot in November 1963 as his motorcade passed Dealey Plaza in the city's downtown.
