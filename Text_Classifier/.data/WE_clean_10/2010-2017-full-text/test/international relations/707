N. Korea claims U.S. nuclear threat using B-1B bombers
SEOUL, May 30 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Tuesday accused the United States of flying B-1B strategic bombers close to its territory and triggering a nuclear war crisis.
A formation of B-1B bombers from Guam flew over Korea on Monday, staging a nuclear bomb dropping drill, Pyongyang's state news agency said.
The bombers even approached an area 80 kilometers east of Gangneung, an eastern city near the Military Demarcation Line, which serves as the border between the two Koreas, it added.
They were joined by warplanes from the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier operating in the East Sea for the "frantic" drill, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
"Such military provocation of the U.S. imperialists is a dangerous reckless racket for bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war," it said in the English-language report.
The military action "clearly proves that their talk about 'dialogue' is nothing but hypocrisy to disarm the DPRK and their wild ambition to eliminate the DPRK with nukes remains unchanged even a bit," the KCNA argued, using the acronym of the North's official name.
"The U.S. imperialist warmongers should not forget even a moment that their increasing danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula would precipitate a disaster which the U.S. mainland turns into a scorched-earth," it said.
The North test-fired a short-range ballistic missile that flew into the East Sea early Monday morning.
