Ex-Penn State student disappears on the day of graduation
Jon S. Steindorf went missing on the very day his parents expected him to graduate from Penn State University.
Steindorf, 23, vanished without a trace on Friday and his anguished parents have now learned that he had dropped out of the central Pennsylvania school last fall,the Centre Daily Times reported.
Investigators with the State College Police Department issued a missing persons report on the 5’10’’, 170-pound Steindorf the following day, noting that the brown-haired and blue-eyed man may be toting a red backpack and riding a black bicycle.
Friends of Steindorf told a student newspaper, The Daily Collegian, that there may be no way to contact or identify him since he left his wallet and cellphone behind.
No one has seen him since Steindorf’s roommate at around 11:30 a.m. on Friday morning, according to the Daily Times. Paul Steindorf and Joanne Steindorf arrived to the apartment at around 4 p.m. to accompany him to the university’s commencement ceremony, but he was nowhere to be found, the publication reported.
“We have had calls and checked those out,” Lt. Bradley Smail of the State College police told the Daily Times on Sunday. “As of this point, nothing.”
Steindorf’s mom pleaded for help locating the missing young man in a Facebook post on Sunday, another student publication, Onward State, reported. She noted her son’s undisclosed withdrawal from the school “does not matter to us.”
“We love Jon dearly and want him to return safely to his family and friends,” Steindorf wrote, according to the student publication. “If anyone has seen Jon, or has any idea of his whereabouts, please contact me or the State College police department.”
“Jon, if you are out there, we love you. Please come home.”
