Shakin' Stevens guilty of assaulting photographer
Former pop star Shakin' Stevens has been found guilty of hitting a press photographer with a microphone stand.
The Cardiff-born singer, whose real name is Michael Barrett, was convicted of assaulting Hugo McNeice during a concert at a hotel in Ballymena.
The 61-year-old was fined £300 for assault and criminal damage and ordered to pay the photographer £479 to compensate for his damaged camera lens.
His solicitor said the singer was disappointed and intended to appeal.
He maintained that "he is innocent of the charges brought".
Mr McNeice said he was "glad it's all over", adding that all he ever wanted was compensation for his broken camera lens.
He had been taking photographs of the singer during a concert at the Tullyglass Hotel in Ballymena, County Antrim, in December 2008.
The trial heard Stevens danced his way towards Mr McNeice, who thought the singer was about to give him "a nice tight shot".
Instead, Stevens pushed his microphone stand into his camera, leaving the photographer "shocked and embarrassed".
Shakin' Stevens was one of the top-selling UK male artists of the 1980s, with hits including Green Door, This Ole House and Merry Christmas Everyone.
