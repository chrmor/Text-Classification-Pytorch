Romania's Social Democrats win national ballot with 221 parliament seats
BUCHAREST, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Romania’s leftist Social Democrat Party won the most seats in both houses of parliament after a national election and will have a combined 221 deputies and senators, final results unveiled by the Central Electoral Bureau showed on Thursday.
Together with their long-time ally, the ALDE grouping, the PSD has an outright majority of 250 seats out of parliament’s 465-seat assembly, which means they will choose the country’s next prime minister to replace outgoing Dacian Ciolos. (Reporting by Radu Marinas; Editing by Hugh Lawson)
