Aussie journo, US student arrested in Egypt
EGYPTIAN authorities have arrested an Australian journalist and a US student, accusing them of trying to bribe people to join a strike marking the first anniversary of Hosni Mubarak's ouster.
A security official identified the two foreigners arrested as an Australian journalist and a US student enrolled at the American University in Cairo.
He said that their Egyptian guide was also detained in the city of Mahalla al-Kobra after residents in the city told police the three were handing out money to people in order to encourage them to participate in the strike, a security official said.
The northern industrial city has seen violent worker strikes in the past.
The accusation against the two reinforces the ruling generals' line that the strike and other protests against their handling of the post-Mubarak transition are the work of "foreign hands" and foreign finance.
On her Twitter account, Aliya Alwi wrote that both she and Australian freelance journalist Austin Mackell were told they would be transferred to a military intelligence office.
"Report against us filed now. Many witnesses saw us 'offering money to youth to vandalise and cause chaos'," she wrote, adding that witnesses were testifying to police against them.
The security official said the three would be interrogated by the attorney general's office.
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release the information.
The arrests follow warnings late on Friday by the country's ruling military council that Egypt faces "conspiracies" - a message activists say seeks to undermine their campaign aimed at pushing the generals to relinquish power.
