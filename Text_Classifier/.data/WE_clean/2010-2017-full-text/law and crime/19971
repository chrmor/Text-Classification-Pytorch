SID to probe allegations of president accepting Ting Hsin donations
Taipei, Dec. 25 (CNA) The Special Investigation Division (SID) decided Thursday to launch an investigation into a radio host's repeated allegations that President Ma Ying-jeou had received a political donation of NT$200 million (US$6.3 million) from Ting Hsin Group. Prosecutor Lin Tzung-chih has been assigned to the high-profile job of finding out all the facts about Clara Chou's allegations that Ma, as head of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), had accepted the donation from Ting Hsin. Chou alleged that the NT$200 million had been donated through KMT Deputy Secretary-General Lin Te-jui, whom Chou accused of protecting Ting Hsin, a disgraced conglomerate that has been at the center of a food scare in Taiwan. SID spokesman Kuo Wen-tung said Lin will investigate whether the nation's political donations law had been violated in the case. At the moment, the SID, which is headed by the prosecutor general, is simply seeking to "understand all the facts surrounding the allegations" and there are no suspects in the matter, Kuo stressed. Earlier in the day, the Presidential Office spokeswoman said Ma was filing a personal lawsuit against Chou, seeking compensation of NT$5 million for damage to his reputation. Following the SID's decision to launch a probe, Chou said she will be questioned Friday by investigators, in the presence of her lawyer. "If they are serious about learning the truth, I will cooperate with them," she said. The SID under the Supreme Prosecutors Office is responsible for probing suspected corruption of top-level officials such as president, vice president, presidents of the nation's five yuans (executive and legislative, etc), Cabinet ministers and three-star or higher generals.
