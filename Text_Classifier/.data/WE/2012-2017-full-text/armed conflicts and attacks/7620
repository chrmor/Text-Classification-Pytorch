Russian Consulate Official Shot Dead In Abkhazia
A Russian consulate official has been shot dead in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia. Police officials in the capital, Sukhumi, say an unknown attacker shot the first secretary of the consulate, 36-year-old Dmitry Vishernev, early in the morning on September 9 as he was leaving for work in his car. Vishernev's wife, who was also in the car, was wounded and taken to a hospital. Initial reports had said she was not hurt. No more details were given. Russian consulates have been operating in Abkhazia and Georgia's other breakaway region of South Ossetia for five years. The separatist regions of Georgia were recognized as independent states by Russia in August 2008 shortly after a brief Russian-Georgian war.
