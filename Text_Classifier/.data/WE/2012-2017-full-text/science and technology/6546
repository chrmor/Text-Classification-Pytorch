Massive asteroid QE2 is traveling with its own moon
There is no reason to fear that either the asteroid or its moon will strike the Earth. The two will make their closest approach to our planet on May 31 at 1:59 PDT, but even then they will still be 3.6 million miles from the Earth, or 15 times farther than the moon.
