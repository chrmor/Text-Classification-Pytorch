Finance Minister to Step Aside in Tokyo
TOKYOâ€”Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said he will be giving up his post to take a key role in the ruling party, casting the government's economic policies into a hazy state until the next steward becomes apparent.
In a move driven by political jockeying ahead of elections expected later this year or in early 2013, Mr. Azumi said on Monday that he will become the top deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Party of Japan.
