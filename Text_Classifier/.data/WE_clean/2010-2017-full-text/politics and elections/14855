L.A. mayor election: Garcetti, Greuel battle for Hollywood
The dance floor at the Avalon was still mostly empty when the polls closed Tuesday, with most guests not expected to arrive at Eric Garcetti’s election-night party until a little later in the night.
Garcetti’s decision to hold his party at the historic nightclub in the heart of Hollywood is symbolic. The candidate has put Hollywood at the center of his campaign, often touting the neighborhood’s turnaround during the three terms he has represented it on the Los Angeles City Council.
Garcetti has pledged to bring similar revitalization to other parts of the city. He has also talked a lot about Hollywood the industry. A few days before election day, Garcetti held a news conference at a Hollywood studio to talk about the passage of a measure that will eliminate city fees for new television pilots filming in L.A.
One of his leading opponents, City Controller Wendy Greuel, a former film studio executive, has touted her own plan to help the ailing industry, which has seen production lured elsewhere by tax incentives. The candidates have fought over who would be a better friend to Hollywood while also fighting over the industry’s deep pockets.
A Times analysis of city Ethics Commission records last month found that actors, producers, directors and others in the industry have donated more than $746,000 directly to candidates, with about $462,000 going to Garcetti and $226,000 to Greuel.
The two have also garnered celebrity endorsements,with and Tom Hanks and Eva Longoria and director Steven Spielberg supporting Greuel and actors Jane Fonda, Will Ferrell and Salma Hayak stumping for Garcetti. Comedian Jimmy Kimmel, actress Amy Smart and musician Moby appeared at a fundraiser for Garcetti at the Henry Fonda Theatre last month, but campaign staff said they don’t know if any celebrities are scheduled to show up tonight.
