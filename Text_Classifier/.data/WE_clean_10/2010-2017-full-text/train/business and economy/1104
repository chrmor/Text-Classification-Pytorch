China closes successful World Expo
China has been bidding farewell to its biggest ever tourism event, the Shanghai World Expo.
The 6 month extravaganza, which showcased some 240 countries and organisations, was hailed a stunning success by Chinese premier Wen Jiabao.
UN Secretary-General Ban ki Moon also lavished praise on the event. He said, ‘‘They came to see with their own eyes, more than 70 million people from dozens of countries and they were not disappointed. To the contrary they were awed and inspired. The government of China, the city of Shanghai, and International Bureau of Expositions deserve the highest praise.’‘
The Expo has shattered all previous attendance records, with more than 70 million people, mostly Chinese, visiting the various pavilions set up by countries.
More impressive, perhaps, is the fact China has spent more on the fair and preparing Shanghai than the Olympic games.
