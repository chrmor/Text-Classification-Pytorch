A huge construction crane buffeted by strong winds collapsed and crashed onto the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Friday, killing as many as 107 worshipers only days before the start of the annual Muslim pilgrimage, the Saudi Arabia Civil Defense reports.
The Civil Defense said on Twitter that as many as 238 people had been injured.
Photos sent by Twitter from the scene show numerous blood-covered bodies strewn on a marble floor under the arm of a large crane.
Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Mansouri, spokesman for the Presidency of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet Mosque, blamed the accident on a "strong sandstorm, winds and torrential rains," the official Saudi Press Agency reports.
The accident occurred as the kingdom prepared to welcome 3 million people to the Muslim holy city for the annual pilgrimage that begins Sept. 21.
Reports of the accident were also carried by Al Arabiya and other Middle East news sites. TheKhaleej Times says there are "many casualties."
The Grand Mosque or Great Mosque of Mecca (also known as Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world. It surrounds Islam’s holiest place, the Kaaba, in the city of Mecca. Muslims face in the direction of the Kaaba while performing their obligatory daily prayers.
One of the five pillars of Islam requires every Muslim to perform the hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. The hajj is one of the largest annual gatherings of people in the world.
The complex covers 88.2 acres, which includes outdoor and indoor prayer spaces. It's open 24 hours a day.
Last year, the number of people permitted to perform the hajj was lowered for safety reasons because of construction work to enlarge the Grand Mosque, Reuters reports.
