Death toll in Jakarta attack rises to 8
JAKARTA - Another person has died from injuries sustained in last week's militant attack in Indonesia's capital, media reported on Sunday, bringing the death toll to eight. The gun and bomb attack on Thursday, which has been claimed by Islamic State, injured around 30 in Jakarta's commercial district. Five of the attackers were among the dead. "An employee at a nearby bank succumbed to injuries on Saturday," news website Detik.com quoted Jakarta police spokesman Mohammad Iqbal as saying. Indonesia has the world's largest number of Muslims, the vast majority of whom practice a moderate form of Islam. Security forces have been largely successful in stamping out homegrown militancy, but last week's attack confirms concerns about a resurgence inspired by ISIS. Police arrested 12 people linked to the Jakarta attack in raids across the country at the weekend, and found evidence the group had planned further attacks targeting security officials and foreigners in other cities like Bandung.
