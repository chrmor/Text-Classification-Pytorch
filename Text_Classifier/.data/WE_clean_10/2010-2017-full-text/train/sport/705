Rioters torched cars and smashed buildings in downtown Vancouver after the city's ice hockey team lost the Stanley Cup final.
The Boston Bruins won the cup for the first time in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League championship.
Thousands of people had jammed into the heart of downtown in the hopes of celebrating a Vancouver win.
Fights broke out in the crowded streets even before the game ended, as the crushing defeat of the home team became obvious.
By the time the Bruins accepted the cup after a 4-0 win inside the Rogers Arena, outside windows were being smashed, stores looted and fires set until black smoke blanketed the downtown core of the western Canadian city.
Dozens of cars, including at least two police cruisers, were flipped over and burned by vandals, who dashed in and out of the crowds of around 100,000 hockey fans.
Young men and a few women, most wearing hoodies with black t-shirts wrapped around their heads, took apart street blockades and launched them into windows of businesses including banks, restaurants and shops.
Four workers huddled in broken glass inside the Da Gino Restaurant on Georgia Street as young men and a woman continued to hurl rocks at the storefront windows.
"They're destroying the city," said one distraught woman inside, who declined to give her name.
Many fans dressed in Canucks jerseys appeared upset at the destruction, with some even yelling at the vandals to stop.
"Way to showcase our city, guys," said Ajay Parmar, who stood angrily in his Canucks jersey as a few young men used street barricades to smash the windows of a coffee shop across from a church.
"This is our city and it's us taxpayers who are going to pay for all this damage," his friend Gurmail Saroya said. "It's disgusting."
Hours after the riots started, the emergency department of Saint Paul's, the major downtown hospital, reached capacity, sending patients to other area hospitals.
The hospital said it remained open to serious emergency cases.
"It's extremely disappointing," Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson told reporters after the game, blaming a few troublemakers among the masses of hockey fans.
A riot erupted in Vancouver the last time the Canucks made it to the Stanley Cup finals and then lost, in 1994, but the city seemed surprised this time after successfully hosting the Winter Olympics last year.
Police efforts to clear the crowds from downtown were stymied when public transit shut down soon after the riots began and bus drivers said they were not safe.
Some dejected Canucks fans began walking away from the downtown zone, but thousands of others stood watching and taking photos of the vandals.
"People taking videos of them only encourages them," said a female police officer, as she stood blocking crowds from entering an alley where a car burned.
Police, including several forces called in from surrounding municipalities, used tear gas, flash bangs, dogs and horses to move people along.
Mostly, though, small groups of police could be seen calmly walking down the streets, moving people even as a few people within the crowds hurled objects at them.
