Palau votes in shadow of US election
As the US election campaign approaches its crescendo, voters in the tiny Pacific nation of Palau have also been casting their ballots to determine their political future.

The incumbent President Johnson Toribiong is seeking to win over his island's population of 15,300 voters.
Analysts say he is struggling to retain office after trailing challenger Tommy Remengesau in a preliminary vote in September which narrowed an open field of presidential candidates to two contenders.
The Palau vote is seen more as a clash of personalities than policies, with the outcome likely to be determined by community ties rather than geopolitical imperatives.
Results are due later this week.
