Bruce Miller released by 49ers after assault arrest
San Francisco 49ers fullback Bruce Miller has been arrested for assault, reports KTVU, Fox's local affiliate in San Francisco.
Following reports of Miller's arrest, the team announced on Monday that the five-year veteran had been released.
Miller, 29, reportedly tried to check into the Fisherman's Wharf Marriott Hotel on Sunday night but was told all rooms were occupied. He knocked on the door of a guest and was told that he had the wrong room before he proceeded to attack the guest.
The guest's father tried to help his son, but was also punched by Miller. The 70-year old father reportedly sustained broken bones after being punched in the face.
Both guests were taken to the hospital.
Miller left the hotel but was apprehended and arrested.
A video obtained by KTVU showed Miller making his way around the hotel with a bloodied face and appearing disoriented.
Miller was drafted by San Francisco in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL draft. He finished last season with 14 yards and one touchdown.
Earlier in the year, Miller pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace. Miller had been arrested in March on suspicion of spousal battery. He was accused of pushing his then-fiancée to the ground and breaking her phone. Prosecutors decided in March not to charge him with spousal battery and instead charged him with one count of misdemeanor vandalism, which was later changed to disturbing the peace.
