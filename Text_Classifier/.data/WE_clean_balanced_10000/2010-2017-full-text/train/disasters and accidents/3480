Eight bodies recovered, scores still missing
At least eight passengers, including seven women, are dead and as many as 70 are still missing following the sinking of a boat on the Chindwin River in Sagaing Region. The Ya Zar Tun sank at about 5:30am on November 1 on its way from Monywa to Sae Zin.
“They have recovered eight dead bodies, including only one man,” U Pho Thaw Oo, an information officer for the National League for Democracy, said yesterday. He added that three passengers of a group of 27 from Linn Sakyit village in Salingyi township,Sagaing Region, had been rescued.
“We can’t estimate how many passengers were on board because it makes frequent stops en route where passengers get on and off. The boat trip takes all night,” he said.
A similar tragedy occurred in 2002, also in November, when an unknown number of passengers went down with the ferry Nge Zin Thein.
“This is the worst time of the year to travel this stretch of the Chindwin,” he said. Accidents involving cargo boats are reportedly common.
The Ya Zar Tun was carrying both passengers and goods.
Rescuers said they were able to save about 30 passengers, but witnesses claimed that around 100 people were on board the vessel at the time of the accident.
The Myanmar Times was unable to contact Kalewa township authorities for further details.
