Harford County shooting: Two deputies killed in Maryland
A gunman opened fire on law enforcement Wednesday, killing two sheriff's deputies in Maryland.
Officers were dispatched to a Panera Bread location in Abingdon for an investigation late Wednesday morning, according to the Harford County Sheriff's Office. There, a suspect fired at a deputy, striking him.
The suspect fled and was seen heading toward nearby apartments, the sheriff's office said.
A second deputy attempted to make contact and also was struck by gunfire. Additional deputies fired at the gunman, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
"Today's a sad for the Harford County Sheriff's Office and the citizens of Hartford County who we are sworn to serve. It's with great sadness that I tell you both deputies who were shot earlier today have succumbed to their injuries," said Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler.
One of the deputies was a 30-year veteran of the agency; the other had served for 16 years. They were not identified by name. The shooting suspect has been identified as David Bryant Evans, 67. Evans had at least two outstanding warrants in two states, including one in Florida for assaulting a police officer, Gahler said.
