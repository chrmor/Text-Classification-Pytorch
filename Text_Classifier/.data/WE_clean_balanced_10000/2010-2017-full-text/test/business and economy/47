Bayer Raises Offer to Buy Monsanto
Bayer AG raised its offer to buy Monsanto Co. and create a new global leader in seeds and pesticides, though the German firm said the higher price depended on achieving a “negotiated transaction.”
Bayer, which has been discussing a deal with Monsanto since mid-May, said it would pay $127.50 a share for the St. Louis-based biotech seed giant, up from its previous offer of $125 a share. The higher offer values Monsanto at over $65 billion, including debt.
