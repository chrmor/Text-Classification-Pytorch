Nepal plane crash kills all 19 on board
A small aircraft taking tourists on a sightseeing trip around Mount Everest crashed in Nepal on Sunday, killing all 19 people on board, officials said.
The Buddha Air Beechcraft plane carrying 10 Indian passengers, three other foreign tourists, three locals and three Nepali crew crashed into a hillside in heavy rain and fog at Godavari, around 10 kilometres (six miles) from Kathmandu.
"All 19 people have died. The Buddha Air-103 was returning from a mountain flight when it crashed into Kotdada Hill," said Bimlesh Lal Karna, head of the rescue department at Tribhuwan International Airport.
Police spokesman Binod Singh told AFP one person had initially survived the crash but had died in hospital.
"The rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain," he added.
Airport authorities on the ground lost contact with the plane at 7:30am and it crashed four minutes later.
