J.K. Rowling: Don't Buy Stolen Harry Potter Prequel
J.K. Rowling is asking her fans to cast a Lumos spell in the hopes of helping police solve a pretty serious case.
The Harry Potter author used Twitter Friday to send out an open call, pleading with her followers not to buy a handwritten, one-of-a-kind copy of a prequel to the iconic series that was stolen in a burglary last month in Kings Heath, Birmingham, England.
“PLEASE DON’T BUY THIS IF YOU’RE OFFERED IT,” tweeted Rowling, 51. “Originally auctioned for @englishpen, the owner supported writers’ freedoms by bidding for it.”

The story, personally written by Rowling, was auctioned off for charity. Plucked from the owner’s home between April 13 and 24 along with an undisclosed amount of jewelry, the handwritten, highly valuable piece exists on the front and back of a 6-by-8-inch postcard.
West Midlands Police in England are calling for Rowling’s fans to assist in spreading their message of an appeal, with Investigating Officer PC Paul Jauncey writing, “The only people who will buy this unique piece are true Harry Potter fans. We are appealing to anyone who sees, or is offered this item for sale, to contact police.”
West Midland law-enforcement officials are asking anyone who knows the whereabouts of the story to contact them.
