UK snow: Travel to be disrupted as more snow forecast
More snow is set to cause travel disruption across the UK, after the Met Office issued a yellow 'be aware' ice warning across much of the country.
It says Northern Ireland, parts of Scotland, north-east England and Yorkshire and Humber will be affected by ice and also snow in some places.
And heavier snowfalls are predicted for south-east England later.
The flight schedule at Heathrow Airport for Sunday will be reduced by 20%, after travellers suffered heavy delays.
The AA has warned drivers to take extra care.
BBC weather forecaster Helen Willetts said there would be some snow in the north-east of England and eastern Scotland on Saturday, with a severe frost across the country overnight into Sunday.
There will be snow in the south-east and the east of England on Sunday, pushing into north-east England later in the day. At least two to five centimetres of snow is expected, she added.
And more snow is expected on Sunday night going into Monday, in the south-east and eastern side of England.
Friday's snowfall reached 26cm (10in) in Sennybridge, in Powys, while elsewhere there was 16cm in Filton, near Bristol, 12cm in Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, and 10cm in Nottingham, according to the BBC Weather Centre.
