Ali Carter won the German Masters after beating Marco Fu in Berlin
Carter trailed 5-3 after the opening session but emerged with all guns blazing, the Essex cueman opening with his first century of the week with a 116 before following up with a 121 to level at 5-5.
Fu's earlier form deserted him as he failed to get on the scoreboard in either of the session's opening two frames, and again failed to pot a ball in the next as Carter scored well to lead in the match for the first time at 6-5.
Hong Kong's Fu eventually ended his potting drought after 86 long minutes before going on to take the 12th frame on the colours to draw level at 6-6 going in to the mid-session interval.
A fine 71 clearance saw Carter restore his lead, however, before he prevailed in a low-scoring 14th to move to within one frame of the title at 8-6.
Another scrappy frame followed and it was Carter who came through and claim his third career ranking title.
"It was tough out there tonight," Carter said. "Marco struggled a bit. We were both keen to put on a good show for the crowd, and I'm delighted to come out the winner at the end of the week.
"Things have turned around for me massively. I just give it my all, it is very satisfying to come out the winner here."
