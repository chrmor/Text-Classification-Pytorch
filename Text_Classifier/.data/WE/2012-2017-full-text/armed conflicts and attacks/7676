Syria crisis: UN inspectors submit chemical weapons report - live updates
We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand:
• The US, UK and France said a UN report showed the Assad regime was responsible for a sarin nerve gas attack east of Damascus last month. Russia said the Western powers had "jumped to conclusions." 
• The UN said it had "indisputable" evidence that sarin was used in the attack. A UN report described rockets, trajectories and launch systems that analysts said implicated the Assad regime. "The facts speak for themselves," UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said.
• It was unclear whether an initial UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons would be backed by a use of force. A deal over the weekend between Russia and the US called for "measures under Chapter VII" to be imposed in case of noncompliance. But the UN security council may pass a nonbinding resolution first.
• "There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language," a state department spokeswoman said. US leaders have insisted on an allowance for force. Russia has resisted.
• Syria accused Turkey of being "hasty" in shooting down a Syrian helicopter that Turkey said crossed its border Wednesday, according to a state media report. Video of the crash has emerged. Turkey said it would explain further what happened to the UN and NATO.
• A presidential authorization by Barack Obama opened the way for the US to send chemical weapons-related personal protective equipment to international organizations working in Syria.
• The activist Local Coordination Committees counted 60 deaths from violence on the opposition side Monday, including 17 in Damascus and environs.
• The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press reported. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said. However many Syrians were returning home as well, if only temporarily. 
• Iran lifted controls on Twitter and Facebook for some areas.
