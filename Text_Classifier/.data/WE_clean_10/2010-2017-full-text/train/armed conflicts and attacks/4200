Heavy explosions rock Tripoli
The Libyan capital Tripoli has experienced a series of heavy blasts and gunfire by what is thought to be Nato air missile strikes.
Eyewitness reports say the five blasts took place in quick succession and are reported to have targeted the Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's compound.
Earlier, the UN aid chief called for a pause in hostilities to ease Libya's humanitarian crisis, and described the situation in the city of Misrata as dire. Will Grant reports.
