'PKK bomb' kills Turkish police
Eight police officers have been killed by a roadside bomb in the southern Turkish province of Bingol, security officials say.
The device was detonated as their bus passed on a road in the Karliova district of Bingol province, they said.
Fighting between the army and PKK rebels in south-eastern Turkey has escalated in the past year, with hundreds of lives lost.
Nine officers were wounded in the blast on Sunday morning, the officials said.
The army has mounted scores of operations in that region, and in neighbouring northern Iraq, in a bid to drive out the rebels.
The PKK has been fighting for an ethnic homeland in south-eastern Turkey since 1984. It is classified as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and EU.
In all, more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict.
