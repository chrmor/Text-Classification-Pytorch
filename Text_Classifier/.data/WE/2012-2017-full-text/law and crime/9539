Ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sentenced to community service
Berlusconi, who served as prime minister three times, has consistently maintained his innocence of the many charges that have been laid against him at various trials throughout the years. He insists that his legal woes are the work of left-wing judges determined to bring him down, and has compared the "persecution" he faces to that experienced by Jesus.
