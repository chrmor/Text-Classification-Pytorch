Study Says New Method Could Be a Quicker Source of Stem Cells
The fact that descendants of the STAP cells could function in mice and their offspring also provided evidence that the cells were not abnormal.
If the technique is to be used to treat patients, it would have to work with cells taken from adult humans, not newborn mice.
Dr. Vacanti said researchers had already replicated the work using adult monkey cells and skin cells from newborn human babies, but not yet from human adults.
He said the research stemmed from work years ago by his lab and others that appeared to find pluripotent cells in the bodies of adult people or animals. He said he began to suspect that researchers were not actually finding stem cells in the body but rather creating them through the stress from the manipulation of the cells in the laboratory.
It has taken several years of work to demonstrate this. Much of it was done by Haruko Obokata, who started as a graduate student in Dr. Vacantiâ€™s lab and is now a biologist at Riken. She is the lead author of the two papers in Nature.
The STAP cells, under the right culture conditions, can form material for the placenta, not just the embryo, which might allow an animal to be cloned just by putting some of its STAP cells in a uterus. Dr. Vacanti said that one researcher, whom he declined to name, had already tried that with mice but had not succeeded.
Scientists said it would be interesting to understand just how and why stress leads already specialized cells to revert to a more primordial state.
