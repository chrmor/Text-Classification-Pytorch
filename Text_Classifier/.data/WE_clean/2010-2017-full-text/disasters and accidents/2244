Sumatra fires cause Singapore haze
Forest fires on the Indonesian island of Sumatra have caused a thick cloud of smoky haze to drift over Singapore, causing the worst air pollution in four years.
The Indonesian Environment Ministry acknowledged that forest fires in Sumatra were the cause of the haze and said it was investigating further.
Environmental activists say the fires may have been lit illegally by farmers to clear land for planting.
