London Olympics: Usain Bolt repeats sprint double by winning 200
LONDON -- Usain Bolt of Jamaica completed his defense of his Olympic sprint double on Thursday, winning the 200 in a season-best 19.32 seconds to lead a Jamaican sweep and cement his place as a legend in the sport, just as he has always wanted, by becoming the first man to repeat in the event.
Bolt, who was so loose before the race that he came out wearing a yellow cap with the brim turned backward, chatted up a female official on the field and gave the royal “wave” as he was introduced at Olympic Stadium, won going away.
He eased up in the final 10 meters and put his left index finger to his lips, as if to hush those who might have doubted him after he lost twice to teammate Yohan Blake at the Jamaican Olympic trials.
For good measure, Bolt dropped to the track and did a few pushups, delighting a rollicking crowd.
Blake was second in a season-best 19.44 seconds, with Warren Weir taking third in a personal-best 19.84.
Wallace Spearmon of the U.S. was fourth in a season-best 19.90 seconds.
As he celebrated, Bolt took a camera from one of the many photographers who swarmed the field and took several photos, including some of Blake wearing the Jamaican flag.
