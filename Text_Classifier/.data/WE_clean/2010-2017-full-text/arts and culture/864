Ou Est Le Swimming Pool’s Charles Haddon committed suicide 'after injuring fan'
Singer downed beer and vodka before hanging himself with belt, finds inquest
Ou Est Le Swimming Pool’s Charles Haddon committed suicide shortly after injuring a fan while crowdsurfing, according to an inquest into the singer’s death.
According to The Metro, Coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict that Haddon had taken his own life after the band’s show at the Pukkelpop festival in Belgium last year on August 20.
Haddon was reportedly “deeply upset” that he’d landed on a female fan during the band’s show after he dived off the stage. His manager, Sam Farr, told how the fan’s father had suggested he might take legal action after claiming that his daughter had suffered three damaged vertebrae due to his crowd surfing. The singer had spoken to her father on the phone after the show, and then drank beer and vodka before hanging himself with a belt in a car park backstage. He was found to have 197mg of alcohol in his blood, which is more than twice the legal drink-drive limit.
Haddon‘s funeral was held in September last year in Northamptonshire. After his death, Ou Est Le Swimming Pool decided to still release their debut album ‘The Golden Year’ in October last year after consulting the late singer’s family.
