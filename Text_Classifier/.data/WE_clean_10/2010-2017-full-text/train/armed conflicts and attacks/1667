At least 14 dead after gunmen attack mosque in Kabul
KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 11 (UPI) -- Gunmen walked into a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital on Tuesday and opened fire, authorities said, killing more than a dozen people and wounding many others inside.
Multiple perpetrators were involved in the attack, news reports said, and all had been killed by police.
At least 14 were reported dead and more than two dozen wounded. Some of the injured include police officers.
"A number of attackers have targeted people in Karte Sakhi shrine," Kabul Police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi said. "Police have evacuated dozens of people from the shrine. A number of civilians and police have been injured."
Voice of America reported that at least three gunmen in Afghan security forces uniforms stormed the shrine and started shooting as hundreds gathered there.
The attack happened as the Muslims celebrated the beginning of Ashura on Tuesday -- the second holiest month after Ramadan. Ashura begins on the tenth day of the first month of the Islamic calendar.
Sunnis ans Shiites celebrate Ashura differently. For Sunnis, it marks Moses being saved from the Egyptians by Allah. For Shiites, it's a more somber occasion that marks the day Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, was murdered in what's now Iraq.
