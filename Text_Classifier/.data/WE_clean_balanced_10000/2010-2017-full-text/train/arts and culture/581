'Game of Thrones' and 'People v. O.J. Simpson' lead the pack
No longer can fans complain that the Emmy Awards ignore what some consider the best show on TV: FX's perpetually snubbed "The Americans" — about undercover KGB spies during the Cold War — finally walked away with five nominations on Thursday morning, including best drama, best actress for Keri Russell and best actor for Matthew Rhys.
Joining "The Americans" in the best drama category is HBO's epic "Game of Thrones," which tallied the most nominations with 23. And there's no doubt champagne corks are popping over at FX, as the cable channel's lauded limited series "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" and acclaimed drama "Fargo" received 22 and 18 nominations, respectively.
While the best drama category was stacked with the usual favorites ("Homeland," "House of Cards," "Breaking Bad" spinoff "Better Call Saul" and the final season of "Downton Abbey"), a new breakout hit showed up: USA's "Mr. Robot," the critically adored vigilante hacker drama starring Christian Slater and Rami Malek, who also earned a lead drama actor nod.
Speaking of breakouts, Netflix's new "Master of None," loosely based on comedian Aziz Ansari's life, showed up in the best comedy category alongside "Silicon Valley," "Transparent," "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt," "Modern Family," "Veep" and "Black-ish," which had an highly praised sophomore season on ABC and saw nominations for lead actors Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross.
While the Oscar nominations were derided for the lack of nominations for performers of color, the Emmy Awards proved much more diverse. Out of 98 nominees in 16 acting categories, the Television Academy nominated 21 actors of color, including Ansari; Taraji P. Henson of "Empire"; Viola Davis in "How to Get Away With Murder"; Kerry Washington as Anita Hill in "Confirmation"; and Cuba Gooding Jr., Sterling K. Brown and Courtney B. Vance in "The People v. O.J. Simpson." In addition, History's high-profile reimagining of the iconic "Roots" miniseries landed eight nominations.

The Emmys air Sunday, Sept. 18 on ABC. See below for a list of major nominations, with our analysis:
Outstanding Drama Series "Downton Abbey" (PBS) "Game of Thrones" (HBO) "Mr. Robot" (USA) "House of Cards" (Netflix) "Homeland" (Showtime) "The Americans" (FX) "Better Call Saul" (AMC) Immediate reaction: Nicely done, "Mr. Robot" — USA's new hacker drama that shocked the Golden Globes by winning best drama series also makes an appearance in the Emmys' most elite category, up against staples including "Homeland," "House of Cards," "Game of Thrones" and the final season of "Downton Abbey." In addition, the inclusion of "The Americans" (finally!) should thrill TV critics across the land, though no telling whether it can make a breakthrough and actually win.

Outstanding Comedy Series "Modern Family" (ABC) "Veep" (HBO) "Silicon Valley" (HBO) "Transparent" (Amazon) "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" (Netflix) "Black-ish" (ABC) "Master of None" (Netflix) Immediate reaction: Just when you're about to declare the network sitcom dead, here comes ABC to save the day. "Black-ish" is no surprise after an excellent second season, though the flagging "Modern Family" (which finally had its winning streak snapped last year by "Veep") is still just a voter favorite. Netflix is likely doing a celebratory dance for its many, many nominations, but the streaming service should be especially psyched about newbie "Master of None" and "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" breaking into this strong category.
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Rami Malek, "Mr. Robot" (USA) Kevin Spacey, "House of Cards" (Netflix) Bob Odenkirk, "Better Call Saul" (AMC) Kyle Chandler, "Bloodline" (Netflix) Liev Schreiber, "Ray Donovan" (Showtime) Matthew Rhys, "The Americans" (FX) Immediate reaction: This list was fairly predictable (Rami Malek was especially considered to be a shoo-in considering the critically-adored "Mr. Robot) save for Matthew Rhys, as "The Americans" is routinely ignored.
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Claire Danes, "Homeland" (Showtime) Viola Davis, "How to Get Away with Murder" (ABC) Taraji P. Henson, "Empire" (Fox) Tatiana Maslany, "Orphan Black" (BBC America) Robin Wright, "House of Cards" (Netflix) Keri Russell, "The Americans" (FX) Immediate reaction: This category is almost an exact replication of last year's nominees, although the departure of "Mad Men" means Keri Russell was able to swoop in and take over Elisabeth Moss's spot. The bigger news here is the lack of recognition for Julianna Margulies on the final season of "The Good Wife."
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie Courtney B. Vance, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) Tom Hiddleston, "The Night Manager" (AMC) Idris Elba, "Luther" (BBC America) Bryan Cranston, "All the Way" (HBO) Benedict Cumberbatch, "Sherlock: The Abominable Bride" (PBS) Cuba Gooding Jr., "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) Immediate reaction: The limited series category is the "People v. O.J. Simpson's" time to shine — sure enough, Courtney B. Vance (whose excellent portrayal of defense attorney Johnnie Cochran made headlines all season) and Cuba Gooding Jr. (the titular O.J.) made the list. The surprise here is Gooding Jr., as he was often considered the weak spot in a star-studded cast of actors. Though we expect Vance to take it, he'll have some competition against TV academy favorite Bryan Cranston as Lyndon B. Johnson in "All the Way." Meanwhile, Tom Hiddleston's nom for "The Night Manager" only means one thing: Taylor Swift is going to the Emmys!

Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie Sarah Paulson, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) Kerry Washington, "Confirmation" (HBO) Audra McDonald, "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill" (HBO) Lili Taylor, "American Crime" (ABC) Felicity Huffman, "American Crime" (ABC) Immediate reaction: Again, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" should rule here, as Sarah Paulson has long been considered a lock with her performance as beleaguered Los Angeles  prosecutor Marcia Clark. Kerry Washington as Anita Hill is another to look out for, as HBO's "Confirmation" got lots of attention. And two nods for "American Crime" is a nice boost for the low-rated but critically-acclaimed ABC series, which was renewed for a third season.
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series William H. Macy, "Shameless" (Showtime) Jeffrey Tambor, "Transparent" (Amazon) Anthony Anderson, "Black-ish" (ABC) Will Forte, "Last Man on Earth" (Fox) Aziz Ansari, "Master of None" (Netflix) Thomas Middleditch, "Silicon Valley" (HBO) Immediate reaction: The mix of shows here just proves the many different tastes of the Emmy voters in the Peak TV era. William H. Macy, Jeffrey Tambor, Will Forte and Anthony Anderson are all repeats, and Aziz Ansari and Thomas Middleditch replace old favorites like Louis C.K. and Don Cheadle. One notable surprise is Ansari, who broke through in a tough category, especially given the acting wasn't the strongest part of the much-praised comedy. 
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series Julia Louis-Dreyfus, "Veep" (HBO) Amy Schumer "Inside Amy Schumer" (Comedy Central) Lily Tomlin "Grace and Frankie" (Netflix) Ellie Kemper, "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" (Netflix) Tracee Ellis Ross, "Black-ish" (ABC) Laurie Metcalf, "Getting On" (HBO) Immediate reaction: Tracee Ellis Ross and Ellie Kemper got well-deserved nods for their relatively new shows, but as everyone knows, this is Julia Louis Dreyfus's category and it's unlikely that will ever change.
Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series Jonathan Banks, "Better Call Saul" (AMC)Ben Mendelsohn, "Bloodline" (Netflix)Jim Carter, "Downton Abbey" (PBS)Peter Dinklage, "Game Of Thrones" (HBO)Kit Harington, "Game Of Thrones" (HBO)Michael Kelly "House Of Cards" (Netflix)Jon Voight, "Ray Donovan" (Showtime) Immediate reaction: Cable dramas rule this category, and newcomer Kit Harington and not-exactly-a-lock Jon Voight squeezed out a final nomination for Alan Cumming (nominated three times for the role of Eli Gold) in one of his strongest years on "The Good Wife."
Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Maura Tierney, "The Affair" (Showtime) Maggie Smith, "Downton Abbey" (PBS) Lena Headey, "Game Of Thrones" (HBO) Emilia Clarke, "Game Of Thrones" (HBO) Maisie Williams, "Game of Thrones" (HBO) Constance Zimmer, "UnREAL" (Lifetime) Immediate reaction: Watching Maura Tierney trying to move on after her husband's infidelity on "The Affair" last year, you could practically see her Emmy acceptance speech already. And although the acclaimed "UnREAL" was left off the best drama list and star Shiri Appleby was snubbed for best actress, Constance Zimmer got a nod for her portrayal of a truly diabolical reality TV producer. And never count out the many noms for "Game of Thrones."

Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series Andre Braugher, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" Fox Keegan-Michael Key, "Key & Peele" (Comedy Central) Ty Burrell, "Modern Family" (ABC) Tituss Burgess, "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" (Netflix) Tony Hale, "Veep" (HBO) Louie Anderson, "Baskets" (FX) Matt Walsh, "Veep" (HBO) Immediate reaction: Again, almost an exact replicate of last year's list (Ty Burrell of "Modern Family" will forever be nominated) although Adam Driver apparently isn't funny enough on "Girls" anymore. Taking his place is Matt Walsh of "Veep" and Louie Anderson on FX's bizarro comedy "Baskets," though they don't seem like serious competition against longtime favorites.
Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Niecy Nash, "Getting On" (HBO) Allison Janney, "Mom" (CBS) Kate McKinnon, "Saturday Night Live" (NBC) Gaby Hoffmann "Transparent" (Amazon) Judith Light, "Transparent" (Amazon) Anna Chlumsky, "Veep" (HBO) Immediate reaction: After six years of nominations (and two wins), "Modern Family's" Julie Bowen was finally knocked out of the category, as the voters continue to love Amazon's groundbreaking "Transparent." Either way, will Allison Janney make it three wins in a row for Chuck Lorre's "Mom"?
Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie Jesse Plemons, "Fargo" (FX) Bokeem Woodbine, "Fargo" (FX) John Travolta, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) Sterling K. Brown, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) David Schwimmer, "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) Hugh Laurie, "The Night Manager" (AMC) Immediate reaction: FX got the most nominations in its history (56 in all), and almost ten percent of them were this category. John Travolta's scenery-chewing take on famed defense attorney Robert Shapiro had people talking, though in terms of actual acting gravitas, no one really holds a candle to Sterling K. Brown's portrayal of prosecutor Chris Darden during the maddening O.J. Simpson trial. Although we will give points to David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian, if only for that scene where he teaches all the mini Kardashians about the perils of fame.
Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie Sarah Paulson, "American Horror Story: Hotel" (FX)Kathy Bates, "American Horror Story: Hotel" (FX)Jean Smart, "Fargo" (FX)Olivia Colman, "The Night Manager" (AMC)Regina King, "American Crime" (ABC)Melissa Leo, "All the Way" (HBO) Immediate reaction: It's always interesting to see whether a performer in a TV movie can overtake one who worked on a multi-episode series, especially on one as beloved by voters as "American Horror Story." Though Melissa Leo is a movie star in an HBO movie, so it was pretty much a given that she would get a nomination — and she should prove tough competition.
Outstanding Reality-Competition Program "The Amazing Race" (CBS) "Dancing With the Stars" (ABC) "Project Runway" (Lifetime) "Top Chef" (Bravo) "The Voice" (NBC) "American Ninja Warrior" (NBC) Immediate reaction: Welcome to the party, "American Ninja Warrior" — not only did you get a nomination, but you beat out the final season of "American Idol," which many predicted would get a farewell nod. Still, the prize will probably go to "The Amazing Race" or "The Voice," as it has in every year of the category's existence except for 2010, when "Top Chef" won.
Outstanding Variety Talk Series "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver" (HBO) "Late Late Show With James Corden" (CBS) "Jimmy Kimmel Live" (ABC) "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" (NBC) "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" (Crackle) "Real Time With Bill Maher" (HBO) Immediate reaction: Well, it should be a little awkward at CBS today — James Corden's "Late Late Show" landed a nod in a category that overlooked Stephen Colbert, the highly-hyped replacement for David Letterman on "The Late Show." While it's no secret that Corden has become a viral sensation while Colbert has yet to really make an impact, that still stings for the more prestigious late-night show.
Outstanding TV Movie "Luther" (BBC America) "All the Way" (HBO) "Confirmation" (HBO) "Sherlock: The Abominable Bride" (PBS) "A Very Murray Christmas" (Netflix) Immediate reaction: We just knew voters wouldn't be able to overlook the celebrity extravaganza of "A Very Murray Christmas," starring Bill Murray and all his Hollywood pals. A much more likely winner is either "Confirmation" or "All the Way" — HBO's TV movies are made to dominate in this category.
Outstanding Limited Series "The People v. O.J. Simpson" (FX) "Fargo" (FX) "The Night Manager" (AMC) "Roots" (History) "American Crime" (ABC) Immediate reaction: This is "The People v. O.J. Simpson's" to lose, regardless of how much the voters love "Fargo." (And they really love "Fargo.")
Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Michael J. Fox, "The Good Wife" (CBS) Max Von Sydow, "Game of Thrones" (HBO) Reg E. Cathey, "House of Cards" (Netflix) Mahershala Ali, "House of Cards" (Netflix) Paul Sparks, "House of Cards" (Netflix) Hank Azaria, "Ray Donovan" (Showtime)
Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series Ellen Burstyn, "House of Cards" (Netflix)Carrie Preston, "The Good Wife" (CBS)Laurie Metcalfe, "Horace and Pete"Allison Janney, "Masters of Sex" (Showtime)Margo Martindale, "The Americans" (FX)Molly Parker, "House of Cards" (Netflix)
