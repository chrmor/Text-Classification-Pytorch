Cabinet resigns day before elections
WILLEMSTAD - Prime Minister Dr. Bernhard Whiteman today submitted the resignation of his cabinet to Governor Lucille George-Wout. That is the tradition on the eve of new elections. Until a new government takes office, the government-Whiteman remains in caretaker form.
The Cabinet which tendered its resignation this morning is the second cabinet that bore the name of Whiteman. He became Prime Minister after his predecessor Ivar Asjes had submitted his resignation late August last year, when the ruling party Pueblo Soberano (PS) lost all confidence in him. Whiteman was at that time Minister of Health, Environment and Nature (GMN).
The first government-Whiteman only lasted a few months. In November last year Member of Parliament for PAIS, Dr. Marilyn Moses withdrew her support for the Cabinet and announced to continue as an independent MP. After the fall of the government, Whiteman was appointed by the governor as "informateur" (person who gathers information about which parties would like to form a government) and later "formateur" (person appointed to form a government). After negotiations, he managed to get the PAR on board his cabinet to help gain a majority in parliament.
PAIS then lost a ministerial post and PAR took over the Ministry of Economic Development with Eugene Rhuggenaath as Minister.
