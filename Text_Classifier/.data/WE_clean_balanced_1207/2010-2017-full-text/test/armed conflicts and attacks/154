Kenya blast 'kills one' in Nairobi's Somali district
A blast in a Somali area of the Kenyan capital Nairobi has killed at least one person and wounded others, police say.
The man killed had been the person carrying the explosives, a Kenyan police spokesman said.
Nairobi and the port city of Mombasa have suffered a series of grenade attacks since Kenya sent troops into Somalia last October to battle the Islamist group al-Shabab.
Al-Shabab has repeatedly threatened to stage revenge attacks in Kenya.
The explosion occurred in the Eastleigh suburb of the city, near Kenya's air force HQ.
One child is among those injured, according to police.
Earlier reports had suggested the blast could have been a suicide attack.
The Kenyan government accuses the Islamist fighters of al-Shabab of being behind various kidnappings on Kenyan soil and of destabilising the border region.
Earlier this year, the African Union force backing Somalia's interim government was boosted from 12,000 troops to nearly 18,000 to incorporate Kenyan troops.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is due to visit Nairobi on Saturday as part of an 11-day tour of Africa.
