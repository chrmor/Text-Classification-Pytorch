U.S. Officially Removes Cuba From State Sponsors of Terrorism List
The U.S. has formally dropped Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.
The announcement comes as American and Cuban officials, who met last week in Washington D.C. for a fourth round of talks, hit some speed bumps on an agreement on fully restoring diplomatic ties and opening embassies.
"The rescission of Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for rescission," State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement. "While the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba's policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation."
The Obama administration removed a major obstacle toward normalization of relations between the two countries last month when it recommended to Congress that Cuba be removed from the list of countries the U.S. considers sponsors of terrorism. The highly anticipated move followed ahistoric meeting between President Barack Obama and Cuba President Raul Castro in Panama at the Summit of the Americas.
