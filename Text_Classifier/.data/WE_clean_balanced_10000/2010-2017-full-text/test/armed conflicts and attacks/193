Jerusalem shooting: Two killed by Palestinian gunman
An Israeli civilian and a policeman have died after a Palestinian gunman opened fire from his car in an attack in East Jerusalem, Israeli police say.
Six other people were wounded in the attack that began at Ammunition Hill.
The gunman fired at a tram stop, then drove off. He stopped after a police pursuit and opened fire again, killing a policeman before being shot dead.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the "very fast, very determined action of the Israeli police".
The militant Islamist group Hamas praised the attack and said the gunman, Musbah Abu Sbaih, was one of its members.
Police said 39-year-old Abu Sbaih came from East Jerusalem.
The two people killed were identified as Levana Malihi, 60, and policeman Yosef Kirma.
Thirty-five Israelis been killed in a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since October 2015.
More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period.
Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation.
