Syrian death toll climbs; Majdal Shams joins riots
Golan Heights residents have joined 'Naksa Day' riots on Sunday after hours of clashes. Majdal Shams residents began hurling concrete blocks at security forces after gas grenades were used to drive away Syrian protestors approaching the border. IDF and police forces responded by using gas grenades against the Druze village residents .
Meanwhile, Syrian state TV says at least 20 people have been killed and 325 others wounded by Israeli gunfire along the border.
One officer was lightly wounded after being hit with a large rock. Several dozens required medical attention, including media personnel after being hit by the grenades.
Meanwhile, the protestors said they were planning to stage a sit-down opposite the border throughout the night.
Earlier on Sunday, the protestors torched two tires placed in a trench along the border. Some also tried to burn vegetation in order to detonate landmines.
A similar attempt had deadly results in the Quneitra crossing. Four old landmines exploded inside Syrian territory, several hundred meters away from the border. IDF elements said that the blasts occurred after protestors hurled Molotov cocktails which set the fire. The fire caused a blast which left casualties among the protestors.
Three Syrians approached the border area in Quneitra and were blocked by IDF soldiers after entering the demilitarized area. They were returned back to Syria.
A senior army officer in the Majdal Shams area said that the protest was deliberately violent. He claimed that the IDF is trying to avoid a large number of casualties and using the appropriate means for this purpose.
Also Sunday, an eight-year-old boy from Majdal Shams sustained moderate to serious wounds after falling off a house rooftop while watching the border clashes. He was taken via helicopter to the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa.
