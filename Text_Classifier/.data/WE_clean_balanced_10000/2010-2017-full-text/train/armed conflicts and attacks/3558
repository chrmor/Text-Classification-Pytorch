Colombian forces raid Farc camp
The raid took place in the province of Meta, an area used by the Farc to produce cocaine.
The two sides exchanged fire, but there were no immediate reports of military casualties.
In another attack, a teenager and a soldier were killed in a New Year's Eve raid by the leftist rebels, the country's military said on Friday.
Guerrillas from the Farc opened fire against an army patrol in the southwestern region of Huila, killing the soldier and a 14-year-old who was caught in the crossfire.
Four other people were hurt in the incident, according to a military spokesperson.
The armed forces have offered a reward of $15,000 for information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.
The Farc, which is thought to number 6,000 to 10,000 fighters,  has been at war with the Colombian government for around 45 years.
