North and South Sudan Tentatively Agree to Demilitarize Disputed Border
JUBA, Sudan — Northern and southern Sudanese officials have agreed to a preliminary arrangement on demilitarizing the border between them, the African Union said Tuesday, though some officials from both sides immediately expressed skepticism of the deal, particularly its ability to resolve the dispute over the contested Abyei area.
Sudan’s internal north-south border — which will soon mark an international boundary between northern Sudan and the soon-to-be-independent nation of South Sudan — has been the site of intense clashes in recent months. Both north and south have mustered a large number of forces along the divide, and on May 21 the northern Sudanese army and local militiamen seized the Abyei area, setting off fears of a larger border war.
But according to a deal reached on Monday night and disclosed by African Union officials on Tuesday, both sides have agreed to establish a demilitarized 12.4-mile-wide zone along the roughly 1,240-mile border, and to have a high-level body with representatives from each side to monitor security arrangements that affect Sudan, both north and south, though its workings are still vague.
“The agreement paves the way for further negotiations on key security issues between the parties, to be convened by the A.U. Panel within the week,” an African Union statement said.
Still, there was ample skepticism. Both sides have broken treaties before.
“The question is, whether the Khartoum army and intelligence implement it?” said Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the southern military. “We doubt it very much.”
