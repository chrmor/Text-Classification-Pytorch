In a record, value of Pi calculated to 2.7tn digits
A French computer scientist claims to have set a new record in the calculation of mathematical constant pi Fabrice Bellard says he has calculated the value of pi to nearly 2.7 trillion digits, some 123 billion more than the previous record. Bellard used a desktop computer to perform the calculation, taking a total of 131 days to complete and also check the result,reports the BBC. This version of pi takes over a terabyte of hard disk space to store. Previous records were established using supercomputers, but Bellard claims his method is 20 times more efficient. The prior record of about 2.6 trillion digits, set in August 2009 by Daisuke Takahashi at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, took just 29 hours. However, that work employed a supercomputer 2,000 times faster and thousands of times more expensive than the desktop Bellard employed. These herculean computations form part of a branch of mathematics known as arbitrary-precision arithmetic â€” simply put, knowing a given number to any amount of decimal places. It is hard to overstate just how long the currently determined pi is; reciting one number a second would take more than 49,000 years. But it is not simply the number that interests Bellard. Bellard plans to release a version of the program he used to do the calculation, but says that carrying on with any further billions of digits "will depend on my motivation".
