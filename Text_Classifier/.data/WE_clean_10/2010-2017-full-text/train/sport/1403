South Korean golfer Jang Ha-na makes first albatross on par-four in LPGA history at Bahamas tournament
South Korean Jang Ha-na made history with an albatross, as Swede Anna Nordqvist and English teenager Charley Hull earned a share of the third-round lead at the Bahamas LPGA Classic on Sunday (AEDT).
Jang hit a three-wood at the short 218-yard eighth hole, and her ball bounced in front of the green before rolling into the cup for the first albatross on a par-four in recorded LPGA history.
Jang, 23, said she did not see the ball go into the hole, but realised something good had happened when her father standing near the green thrust his arms into the air.
As Jang approached the hole, she dropped to her knees and kissed the ground at the Ocean Club course on Paradise Island.
"Oh my God, it was so unbelievable," she told Golf Channel. "Right now, my heartbeat is a little fast."
Despite her excitement, Jang was disappointed a car was not on offer for an ace at the hole.
"A new car, please, a car, please," she pleaded. "I need a car."
Jang's 5-under-par 68 left her five shots behind co-leaders Nordqvist (68) and Hull (69), who were at 12-under 207 on a crowded leaderboard, with five others bunched within two shots.
