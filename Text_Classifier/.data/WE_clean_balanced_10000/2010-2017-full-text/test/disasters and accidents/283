Five dead in Lincolnshire explosion
Blast at industrial estate in Boston engages local emergency services. Police say five men were killed
Police are investigating after five people were killed and one man suffered injuries in an explosion at an industrial unit in Lincolnshire.
The explosion occurred shortly before 7.30pm on Wednesday in the Broadfield Lane estate in Boston, a collection of light industrial outlets including a mechanic's workshop and a vehicle wrecking yard.
The bodies of the dead were found by firefighters who battled through intense flames to gain access to the building.
"Five men have been confirmed dead," a police spokeswoman said. She added that the injured man had been taken to Boston Pilgrim hospital and later transferred to the Queen's medical centre in Nottingham.
"Inquiries are ongoing and will be ongoing throughout the night to establish the cause of this explosion," the spokeswoman said.
Steve Moore of Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service said six fire engines were sent after several 999 calls.
"When the first crews attended they were faced with a really serious fire and a casualty who was outside the building suffering from burns," he said. "Their initial reaction was to treat the casualty. The incoming crew then started to fight the fire. It was a really hot, intense fire."
He said high temperatures from the fire set alight a car outside and buckled roller gates covering the entrance, forcing firefighters to cut their way in using hydraulic equipment.
He said they did not yet know the cause.
"At this stage we are not able to speculate on the cause. The police are leading the investigation, they have forensic people in attendance. We will be supporting the police investigation."
Moore described the incident as one of the most serious he had seen in his 28-year career.
"As far as the crews I have spoken to, its the single greatest loss of life in fire in their experience."
