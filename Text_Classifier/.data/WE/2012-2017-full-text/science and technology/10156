New sengi species is related to an elephant, but small as a mouse
The species was first discovered among other elephant shrew samples collected from southern Africa and stored at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. With a rusty-toned coat, this strange animal looked different from the other sengi collected from Namibia â€“ and a preliminary genetic analysis seemed to back that up. But was it a weird outlier or a member of a whole new species?
