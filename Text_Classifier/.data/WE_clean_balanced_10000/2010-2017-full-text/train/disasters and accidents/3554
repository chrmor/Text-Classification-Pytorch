Harmony of the Seas accident: One person killed and four injured after accident on world's biggest cruise liner
A Harmony of the Seas crew member has died and four others have been injured after a lifeboat fell off the world’s biggest cruise ship.
The record-breaking ship, which is operated by Royal Caribbean, is docked in the French port of Marseille.
One person is dead and four are injured, including two whose lives are in danger," a spokesman for the fire service told the AFP news agency. 
Five crew were onboard the lifeboat taking part in a safety drill when it "became detached" from the ship.
A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean said in a statement: "We are sorry to share the sad news that a crew member aboard Harmony of the Seas has died of injuries suffered during a lifeboat drill conducted while docked at the port of Marseille, France.
"Four other crew members received medical treatment in the same incident. We are keeping our colleagues and their families in our thoughts and prayers."
The liner only had its maiden voyage on 29 May.
Built by shipbuilders STX France, it is the widest ever cruise ship at a maximum of 66m across and is 50m longer than the Eiffel Tower at 362m.
Using its 16 decks, it can carry more than 6,700 passengers and 2,300 crew.
The Independent has contacted STX France for comment.
