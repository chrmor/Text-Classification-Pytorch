Global work party focuses on global warming prevention
JACKSON, MS (WLBT) - It's 10-10-2010, a date chosen by environmentalists for a global work party.
Sunday Jackson, Mississippi joined a worldwide effort to stop global warming. Live music played as volunteers gathered at Mimi's Friends and Family Café in Fondren to walk the streets and clean up the area. They picked up trash and recyclables during the Fondren Clean and Green walk.
Participants are spreading the message of reducing carbon emissions, using less fossil fuel and recycling.
"Our carbon dioxide levels in the climate are going so high that scientists tell us that it may spiral out of control and make the climate almost unlivable. So we're trying to get things turned around so that we can get the co2 in the atmosphere back down to where it's more livable," said Luke Lundemo, Fondren Ass. of Business Green Team Captain.
Organizers say more than 7,000 events took place in 188 different countries.
