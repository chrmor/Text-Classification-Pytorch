West Bank: Two Palestinian assailants killed after attempted attack
Two Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops Wednesday after infiltrating a West Bank settlement and wounding a settler, the military said.
"Two assailants infiltrated the community of Eli, south of Nablus. They attacked a man outside his home," the army said in a statement.
"Forces arrived... (and) shot the attackers resulting in their death."
The wounded man was taken to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem in moderate condition, the Times of Israel reports.
The residents of Eli, which is located in the central West Bank, were told to stay indoors following the incident, according to the Times of Israel.
A settler was wounded trying to stop them before the soldiers arrived, an army spokesman said.
A wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories since early October has killed 180 Palestinians as well as 28 Israelis, an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean, according to an AFPtoll.
Most of the Palestinians who died in the violence were killed by Israeli forces while carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities.
Others were shot dead by Israeli forces during clashes or demonstrations.
