Two ballistic missiles fired at Saudi from Yemen: Coalition
Two ballistic missiles have been fired from Yemen at Saudi Arabia, one of which was intercepted by the kingdom's air defences, the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemeni rebels said Friday.
The other missile struck an area of desert east of the Saudi city of Najran, the coalition said in a statement carried by the kingdom's SPA state news agency, without reporting any casualties.
