Apple Settles Legal Dispute With Nokia
Apple and Nokia settled a legal dispute on Tuesday over the right of the iPhone maker to use patents and other intellectual property owned by the Finnish telecommunications company.
The move comes less than six months after Apple said that it would no longer pay to use Nokia’s patents, many of which are built into Apple’s suite of products, accusing the Finnish company of extortion.
In response, Nokia filed lawsuits in 11 countries, including Germany and the United States, aiming to defend its intellectual property. Nokia said that Apple should pay for technology used in smartphones, tablets and other devices.
That tug of war, however, is now over.
On Tuesday, the companies said that they had settled all of the lawsuits, and that they had signed a new patent agreement under which Apple will start paying royalties to Nokia from the second quarter of 2017. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.
In a sign that they had buried the hatchet, Apple and Nokia also announced that they had signed new business agreements: Apple will begin stocking some of Nokia’s digital health products in its stores, and the Finnish company will provide some of its mobile network infrastructure products and services to the American company.
