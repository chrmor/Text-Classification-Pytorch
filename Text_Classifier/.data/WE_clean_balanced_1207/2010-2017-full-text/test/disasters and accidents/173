At least 18 die in Philippines typhoon
The death toll in the Philippines from Typhoon Nesat has climbed to 18 as the government rushes to restore lifelines ahead of another storm churning to the east of the country.
Rescuers reported two more deaths overnight, while 35 others remained missing a day after Nesat unleashed heavy rains, winds and storm surges across the main island of Luzon, Office of Civil Defense chief Benito Ramos said.
"We are focusing on trying to get power and telecommunications services today, and work crews have also fanned out to repair and clear 61 road networks across Luzon damaged by landslides, debris and floods," Ramos told AFP on Wednesday.
At the height of Nesat's fury on Tuesday, dramatic storm surges in Manila Bay crashed over seawalls, flooding a hospital, a five-star hotel and the US embassy.
Parts of Luzon remained under waist-deep flood waters on Wednesday after the government released waters from four dams that had reached critical levels in Bulacan province, about an hour's drive north of Manila.
A water catchment used to irrigate farms also broke its walls, flooding many villages also in Bulacan, Ramos said.
