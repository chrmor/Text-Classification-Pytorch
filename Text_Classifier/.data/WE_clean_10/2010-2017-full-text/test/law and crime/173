Mexico: Gay Adoption Law Upheld
Mexicoâ€™s Supreme Court voted Monday to uphold a Mexico City law allowing adoptions by same-sex couples. Justices voted 9 to 2 against challenges presented by federal prosecutors and others who had argued that the law failed to protect children against discrimination. The law applies only in Mexico City, but other states must respect adoptions made there.
