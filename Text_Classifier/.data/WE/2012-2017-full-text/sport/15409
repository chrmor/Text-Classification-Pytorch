Perhaps the human bat flip would be more apropos. Regardless, the sheer joy of the South Korean squad was evident after they rallied to upset Japan 4-3 in the semifinal and overwhelmed the U.S. in the finals.
The tournament featured each of the the top 12 ranked national teams. South Korea came in at No. 8, so it truly was a great run to emerge from the Premier 12 tournament with the gold medal. They finished the tournament 6-2, suffering losses to Japan and the United States during the round-robin portion. That they bounced back to avenge those losses makes the run even more impressive.
Byung Ho Park, whom the Minnesota Twins recently won the rights to negotiate a big-league contract, hit a three-run homer to key South Korea's championship victory. That was part of a five-run fourth inning.
Hyun-soo Kim capped his huge tournament by going 3-for-5 with three RBIs. He was later named tournament Most Valuable Player.
