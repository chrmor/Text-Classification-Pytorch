China, Taiwan brace for super typhoon after dozens killed in flooding
China was bracing for a super typhoon on Thursday after weeks of heavy rain killed dozens and submerged huge swathes of the country in floods.
Typhoon Nepartak, which is barrelling towards Taiwan after packing winds of up to 163 mph on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall on the island early on Friday before heading towards China later in the day.
The super typhoon is set to add more misery to “an already perilous local flood situation” in China, Xinhua news agency said, as the country grapples with its worst flooding since 1998.
A total of 186 people have been killed since last Friday, the China Daily newspaper said, citing authorities. China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said 41 people are missing, almost 50,000 houses collapsed and more than 1.6 million people have been relocated.
