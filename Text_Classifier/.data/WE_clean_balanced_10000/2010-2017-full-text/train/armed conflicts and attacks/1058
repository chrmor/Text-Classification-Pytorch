Three dead as 20 NATO tankers set ablaze in Pakistan
Three people were killed on Monday and up to eight others wounded when about 20 NATO oil tankers were attacked and set ablaze near the Pakistani capital, in the second mass torching in days.
Television pictures showed towering flames springing from the trucks that were filling up just outside Islamabad en route to Afghanistan early in the morning when gunmen attacked the convoy with molotov cocktails.
It follows a similar incident on Friday in the south, when heavily armed gunmen set ablaze more than two dozen trucks and tankers carrying fuel for the 152,000-strong foreign forces fighting the Taliban-led insurgency.
"Three people have died, eight are injured. They have all received bullet injuries and are mostly drivers and their helpers," police emergency official Mohammad Ahad told AFP by telephone.
The unknown number of gunmen fled the scene, Ahad said, and Geo television showed fire brigades spraying the burning tankers that had set nearby trees and bushes ablaze, lighting up the night sky.
Ambushes of NATO convoys are not uncommon, but are normally concentrated in strongholds of Islamist militants in the lawless northwest, where Pakistan has closed a key land crossing into Afghanistan after a cross-border NATO attack.
