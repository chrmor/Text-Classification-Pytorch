Greek PM survives confidence vote, may quit
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou survived a parliamentary confidence vote on Saturday, avoiding snap elections which would have torpedoed Greece’s bailout deal and inflamed the euro zone’s economic crisis.
But the nation remained in political, social and economic turmoil and Papandreou signaled he would still stand down, calling for a new coalition to ram the 130 billion euro bailout deal through parliament and avoid the nation going bankrupt.
Papandreou’s socialist government won with 153 votes in the 300 member parliament, and a rebellion by some dissidents in his PASOK party failed to materialize after he indicated that his term as prime minister was close to an end.

The leaders of the far-right LAOS party and another center-right party indicated after Papandreou’s speech that they would cooperate in a new coalition.
Papandreou provoked uproar at home and abroad on Monday when he announced a referendum on the bailout, agreed by euro zone leaders only last week.
Under heavy domestic and international pressure, he backed down on a vote which could well have rejected the deal, potentially sinking euro zone leaders’ attempts to stop the debt crisis devastating economies such as Italy and Spain.
The government officially announced earlier on Friday that the referendum would not go ahead.
