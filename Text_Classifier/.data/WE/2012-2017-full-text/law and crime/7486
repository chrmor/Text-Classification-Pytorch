The step-grandfather of C.J. Spiller , the dynamic Bills ' running back, has reportedly been identified as the gunman in a shooting that left two men dead and two others injured, before he committed suicide Saturday morning in Union County, Fla.
According to WCJB in Gainesville, Fla., Union County Sheriff Jerry Whitehead said Hubert Allen, Jr. walked into Pritchett Trucking on Saturday morning and shot an employee. Allen then headed to the family farm of company owner Marvin Pritchett where he shot and killed Prichett and a farmhand. Allen, who previously worked for the trucking company, returned home where he took his own life.
After the news broke, the Buffalo News Tim Graham sent this series of tweets explaining the close relationship between Allen and Spiller.
Spiller and the Bills faced the Redskins Saturday afternoon in a Week 3 preseason game.
