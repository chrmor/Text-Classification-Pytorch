New Zealand prime minister John Key sworn in for third term
New Zealand prime minister John Key has been officially sworn in for a third term of office.
The other 19 members of his cabinet and seven ministers outside of cabinet were also given their ministerial warrants by the governor-general during a ceremony this morning.
Mr Key told his executive team that they were voted in to provide a strong and stable government.
He urged them to "savour the moment" as they have a huge workload ahead of them.
He said that while there would be good days and bad days, "every day in government is a lot better than opposition".
Mr Key said he was determined to move past controversies that had mired his last term's cabinet, which saw five ministers resign after becoming entangled in various scandals.
The National Party holds 60 seats in the 121-seat parliament.
It has signed support agreements with the Maori, United Future and Act parties which together hold another four seats.
