Zimbabwe sets election date
Elections to choose a new government in Zimbabwe will go ahead on July 31, the country's top court has ruled.
The disputed date had originally been set by President Robert Mugabe.
The court dismissed appeals by both Mugabe and his nemesis Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, to have the date postponed following pressure from regional leaders.
"Elections should proceed on the 31st of July 2013 in terms of the proclamation by the president in compliance with the order of this court," chief justice Godfrey Chidyausiku ruled.
The presidential vote will be held on the same day as parliamentary elections and will choose a government to replace an uneasy power-sharing deal between Mugabe and Tsvangirai in place since 2009.
Mugabe had lodged an application to shift by two weeks the date that he had himself set, after regional bloc the Southern African Development Community (SADC) asked him to allow more time for preparations.
