Finland: 73-year-old kills police officer, wounds another
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) â€” A 73-year-old man has shot a police officer to death with an automatic weapon and seriously wounded another after they approached a remote countryside property where gunfire had been reported, Finnish police said Saturday.
Police in Vihti, northwest of Helsinki, dispatched several officers to the property late Friday. They were targeted by gunfire as they approached the house and one shot fatally wounded a 30-year-old policeman and seriously wounded another. The condition of the wounded policeman was not immediately known.
The shooter eventually committed suicide, possibly by shooting himself, police told a news conference.
