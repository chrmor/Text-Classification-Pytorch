Invictus Games Closing Concert, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - music review: Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl dedicated My Hero to 'all the heroes'
For all Prince Harry’s good deeds as the driving force behind the Invictus Games, it was just as well that his own musical taste – dubstep, hip-hop and heavy metal – didn’t dictate this concert line-up.
The sometime party prince was a visible presence at the finale, which proved a distraction during ex-soldier James Blunt’s crowd surfing. You’re Beautiful was even dedicated to Harry, though he was too busy munching a burger to notice Blunt or indeed the girls seeking selfies, who were fended off by a protection officer.
With fine weather, a backdrop of the Olympic Stadium and a 26,000-capacity sell-out, the concert was a success that couldn’t quite match the drama of the games themselves.
The medal presentations between sets were always going to pack more of an emotional punch than, say, Rizzle Kicks singing Mama Do the Hump. And there was the bonus of seeing Princess Eugenie saunter in to one ceremony just as the DJ played Lorde’s Royals.
It was even more awkward for Ryan Adams, who quickly realised this audience had no interest in his blistering Americana (it was their loss).
Ellie Goulding did better with a pop performance that had the heft of a rock show as she stomped around in a crop top and Doc Martens during Figure 8. But the VIP area at the front hindered her ability to connect with this crowd.
Kaiser Chiefs did manage to unite the audience with the energetic Ricky Wilson hollering his way through the hits. Boris Johnson could be seen rocking out to I Predict a Riot.
There were three cheers for Prince Harry and plenty more for Team GB ahead of headliners Foo Fighters, who didn’t play any new material at this major comeback.
Dave Grohl dedicated My Hero to “all the heroes” and declared it one of the “most special occasions of our life”.
There were no surprises but it was an efficient performance in front of audience hungry for hits – All My Life, The Pretender, Best of You - from one of the world’s biggest rock bands.
The day really belonged to the athletes, though.
