Foreigners rescued as Mali hotel siege leaves 7 dead Five foreigners and several other hostages were freed overnight after they were held by gunmen who raided a hotel in central Mali in an attack that left at least seven people dead, military sources said early Saturday. At least five Malian soldiers are believed to have been killed in the operation to end the siege at the Hotel Byblos in Sevare, which is popular with UN peacekeeping staff. A source told AFP that "a number of hostages" were freed by Malian forces, including the five foreigners, although their nationalities were not specified. The Malian army brought the siege to an end early Saturday. It said the initial target of the attack was a Malian military site.
