Officials: Controller in deadly train crash playing mobile game
MUNICH, Germany, April 12 (UPI) -- A German controller who was operating the tracks where two trains collided in February was arrested Tuesday on possible manslaughter charges, authorities said.
Eleven people died in the Feb. 9 crash near Bad Aibling, Germany, and dozens more were injured.
Investigators said two trains collided head-on because they were on the same track.
Tuesday, Bavarian prosecutors said the controller who caused the crash had been playing a game on his mobile phone, which led to his making a signalling error.
After the signalling error, officials say, the controller then pressed the wrong emergency buttons to notify the trains' conductors they were on a collision course.
The unidentified man could face involuntary manslaughter and negligence charges for the crash, which was Germany's deadliest in nearly 20 years.
News reports said the man denied to authorities that playing the game distracted him in the course of his duties.
The investigation into the crash is ongoing.
