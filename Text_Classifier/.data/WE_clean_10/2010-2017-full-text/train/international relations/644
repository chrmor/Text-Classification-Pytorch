Libya suspended from Arab League sessions
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa stated Tuesday that the organization has decided to halt the participation of the Libyan delegations from all Arab League sessions, the al-Jazeera network reported.
Moussa made his statements following the somewhat-imperative speech of Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi in which he declared that he had no intention of resigning and that he would act with a heavy hand against anyone who tries to ignite the country to riot. (Roee Nahmias)
