Qassam hits Negev; no injuries
The relative calm in the Negev was disturbed Saturday morning when a Qassam fired by Palestinians in north Gaza exploded in the region. There were no reports of injury or damage.
The rocket landed in an open field within the limits of the Sdot Negev Regional Council.
Just last week Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar told the London-based Al-Hayat daily that the Islamist organization would not violate the ceasefire with Israel agreed on after Operation Cast Lead
"There is an agreement about a state of calm which was reached after the war with the help of Egypt and all the factions agreed on it," he said.
Al-Zahar criticized Palestinian terrorists who fire rockets towards Israel, saying they "rebel against their own factions and this is proved by the fact that no one has ever taken responsibility. Do they expect us to shake the hand of a man who rebels against his own factions? Opening the door would lead to chaos. Some of the factions didn't fire a single shot during the war and now they want to market themselves."
