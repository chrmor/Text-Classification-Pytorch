At least 40 servicemen of the Tajik Defense Ministry died in an attack on government troops in the east of the Central Asian country, the Asia-Plus news agency quoted a law enforcement source as saying.
The troops were searching for criminals who had escaped from a pre-trial detention center in August.
Earlier the Defense Ministry said 23 were killed.
Ten servicemen were also wounded as the 75-strong military column came under fire from grenade launchers and machineguns on Sunday.
The ministry said the column was attacked by the gang led by Mullo Abdullo, one of the uncompromising opposition leaders in the region since late 1990s.
There were five officers among the killed servicemen, the source said.
