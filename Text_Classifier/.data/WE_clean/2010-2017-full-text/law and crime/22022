F.B.I. Investigating Police Accounts of Black Woman’s Death in Custody
Days after a black woman from suburban Chicago was found dead in a Texas jail cell, her friends and family are contesting police statements that she killed herself.
The woman, Sandra Bland, 28, was arrested last Friday in Waller County by an officer with the Texas Department of Public Safety on a charge of assaulting a public servant. She had been pulled over for failing to signal a lane change.
A statement from the Waller County sheriff’s office said that the cause of Ms. Bland’s death appeared to be self-inflicted asphyxiation. An autopsy on Tuesday classified her death as suicide by hanging, according to The Chicago Tribune.
In a statement released Thursday afternoon, the Texas Department of Public Safety said that the Texas Rangers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were jointly investigating the cause of Ms. Bland’s death.
