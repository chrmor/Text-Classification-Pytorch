'Stay With Me' wins Grammy for top record
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” "Stay With Me (Darkchild Version)" by Sam Smith has won the Grammy for record of the year.
It capped a big night for the British singer, who had already won song of the year for the sultry hit. The 22-year-old British singer was named best new artist and won best pop album for "In the Lonely Hour," which contained the hit.
Smith recently added Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne to the songwriting credits for the composition, given the chorus' similarity to Petty's hit "I Won't Back Down."
He competed in the category with "Fancy" by Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX; "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift; "Chandelier" by Sia; and "All About That Bass" by Meghan Trainor.
