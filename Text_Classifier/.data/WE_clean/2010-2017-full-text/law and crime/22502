Former 'Star Trek: Voyager' actress charged with indecent exposure in Tennessee
A former actress on the "Star Trek: Voyager" television series has been arrested in eastern Tennessee and is accused of exposing herself to children.
Multiple media outlets report that 41-year-old Jennifer Ann Lien, who played "Kes" on the TV show, is charged with two misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure involving children under age 13, according to an arrest report.
Roane County Sheriff's Office deputies served the warrants Sept. 3 at Lien's Harriman home, where they say she was naked under a blanket on her couch. Deputies say Lien refused their requests to get dressed.
Harriman Police Chief Randy Heidle says Lien also faces multiple charges, including aggravated assault, stemming from an April incident in which he says Lien rammed a police cruiser with her vehicle. It is unclear if she has an attorney.
