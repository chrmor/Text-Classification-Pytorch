Japan activists land on disputed islands amid China row
At least 10 Japanese nationalist activists have landed on a group of disputed islands, amid an escalating territorial row with China.
The activists swam ashore after a flotilla carrying about 150 people reached Japan's controlled Senkaku islands, called Diaoyu in China.
Japan's coast guard is now questioning the activists, who had earlier been denied permission to visit the islands.
