Video: Huge 'meteorite' explodes in ball of fire over Russian city
A huge meteorite has reportedly been captured streaking through the night's sky above Russia, before disappearing in a blaze of light.
People living in the northern city of Murmansk spotted the object exploding in the dark at around 2.10am this morning, with many capturing the moment on cameras mounted on the dashboards of their cars.
Video footage shows a white blue light shooting through the sky, before appearing to explode and disappear from view.
Those who saw it believe it was a meteorite, but RT news say officials have not confirmed what it was or whether any "fragments" landed on Earth.
Emergency services said no injuries or damage was reported.
The latest sighting comes after a large meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk last year , briefly outshining the sun and inflicting severe burns on observers below .
