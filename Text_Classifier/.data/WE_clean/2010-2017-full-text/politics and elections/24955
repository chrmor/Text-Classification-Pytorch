Minimum wage protesters storm debate center
MILWAUKEE, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Protesters demanding a $15 minimum wage stormed in to the debate center before Thursday's Democratic Party debate at the University of Wisconsin.
The group held up signs that said "Fight for $15," "Immigrant Justice," and "Black Lives Matter" in the area just outside the press room at the center, about 7 p.m. chanting "If you want our vote, come get our vote."
The protest was similar to incidents in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire and though the Fight for $15 movement hasn't endorsed any candidates, the Services Employees International Union, who has helped push the movement, has endorsed Hillary Clinton.
The group had scheduled a rally a few blocks away, but decided to march to the university's campus about an hour before the debate.
