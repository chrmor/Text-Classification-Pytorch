Australia v New Zealand, Rugby League World Cup Final 2013
The forwards made fantastic metres on every set, and the backline players were deadly every time they got a bit of space. Hayne, Thurston, Morris and Slater were all brilliant.
Sonny Bill Williams won’t be happy with his performance, but perhaps the expectations of the World Player of the Year were higher than on all his team mates, as to a man, they were underwhelming.
But when Australia, with the talent they have, are that clinical in their execution, it’s tough to see how ANY team could keep up with them. Matt King just said that Australia were “on another level tonight” and that’s a very succinct way of putting it.
