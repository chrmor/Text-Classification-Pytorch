21 arrested as hundreds of Trump supporters and counter-protesters clash at Berkeley rally
"These people create violence all the time... somebody has to stand up to them," said Alegria, who was injured in the fight. He was treated by Trump supporters who bandaged his head, washed off the pepper spray and gave him encouragement, saying, "You've earned your stripes, bro."
