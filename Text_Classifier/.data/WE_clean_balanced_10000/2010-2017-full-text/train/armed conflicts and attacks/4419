Thousands flee Cote d'Ivoire violence
Cote d'Ivoire has been embroiled in political crisis ever since disputed presidential elections last year and violence has only spiked in recent weeks. Dozens were killed in the renewed clashes between warring factions.
Laurent Gbagbo, the disputed president, has refused to step down to make way for his rival internationally-recognised Alassane Ouattara.
Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee to neighbouring Liberia due to the conflict, but many of them have been unable to reach the safety of refugee camps as a result of difficult terrain.
