'To Kill A Mockingbird' author Harper Lee to publish second novel
It may be the most unexpected sequel in the history of publishing. Harper Lee, the author who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird then maintained 55 years of silence, is to reveal what happened next.
In an announcement that stunned the literary world, Lee, 88, said that she is to publish her second novel this summer, revisiting Scout and Atticus Finch.
And she described it, in her understated way, as “a pretty decent effort”.
Go Set a Watchman is set 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, during the Civil Rights era, when the idealistic Scout has grown up. Her lawyer father, Atticus, is still alive and she returns to their hometown of Maycomb, Alabama to visit him.
Although Lee has had more than half a century to write the book, it turns out she did no such thing.
The writing of Go Set a Watchman preceded that of To Kill a Mockingbird. She wrote it in the 1950s as the original story of Scout. But it was the flashback’s to the character’s childhood that caught the eye of Lee’s editor, who persuaded her to write about a young Scout instead.
Lee put the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman to one side and believed it lost until recently, when she was “surprised and delighted” to learn it had been found.
To Kill A Mockingbird was published in July 1960, won the Pulitzer Prize and was made into a 1962 film with an Oscar-winning performance by Gregory Peck. And that was that: Lee became the world’s most famous literary one-hit wonder.
She has spent the intervening years guarding her privacy, although she was never a mysteriously reclusive figure in the mould of her contemporary, JD Salinger.

She made occasional public appearances and in 2006 wrote an open letter to Oprah Winfrey, extolling the merits of good, old-fashioned books.
“In an abundant society where people have laptops, cellphones, iPods, and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books. Instant information is not for me. I prefer to search library stacks because when I work to learn something, I remember it,” she wrote.
She asked: “Can you imagine curling up in bed to read a computer?” adding that “some things should happen on soft pages, not cold metal”.
The new book runs to 304 pages and will be published with an initial print run of two million copies.
In a statement released via her publisher, Lee said: “In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman.
“It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort.
“My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout’s childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became To Kill a Mockingbird) from the point of view of the young Scout.
“I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realised it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it.
“After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years."
Carter found the manuscript “at a secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill A Mockingbird”, the publisher said.
A note on the plot of the new novel signals that both father and daughter have been scarred by the trial featured in the original story.
Scout “returns to Maycomb and is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood”.
Jonathan Burnham, Lee’s publisher at Harper, said: “This is a remarkable literary event. “The existence of Go Set a Watchman was unknown until recently, and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of To Kill a Mockingbird.
“It is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and daughter’s relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s.”
