New Colombian monkey species discovered, but only 250 are left
A Colombian monkey species that had long been rumored but which scientists couldn't reach because of insurgent violence in the remote area where it lives has finally been found -- teetering on the brink of extinction.
The new species of cat-sized titi monkey was discovered in the Colombian Amazon by researchers from the National University of Colombia, who dubbed it Callicebus caquetensis
However it's not known how long the species will last. The scientists estimate that only 250 of the monkeys are still alive, as their forest home is being cut down to make way for farms.
The monkeys live Department of Caquetá, close to the border with Ecuador and Peru.
Evolutionary biologist Martin Moynihan saw the species in the 1980s, but violence in the area kept researchers who could confirm the discovery away until 2008, when scientists Thomas Defler, Marta Bueno and Javier García were finally able to travel to the upper Caquetá River, where they found 13 groups of the monkeys.
The discovery is described in the current issue of the journalPrimate Conservation.
The monkeys, called zogui zoguiin Spanish, have one of the most complex calls in the animal kingdom, which they use to mark their territory.
"We had heard about this animal, but for a long time we could not confirm if it was different from other titis. We now know that this is a unique species, and it shows the rich diversity of life that is still to be discovered in the Amazon," Defler said in a statement issued by Conservation International, which helped fund the research.
