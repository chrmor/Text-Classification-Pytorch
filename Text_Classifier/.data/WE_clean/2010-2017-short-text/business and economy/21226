The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration says Russian officials have manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Russia's largest Yukos oil company, and jail its boss (Mikhail Khodorkovsky and others). Yukos was the object of a series of politically motivated attacks by the Russian authorities that eventually led to its destruction. The company's assets were illegally expropriated for the benefit of State companies Rosneft and Gazprom. The Yuganskneftegaz auction was illegal. The $50 billion awarded by the Hague's arbitration court against Russia is the largest arbitration award ever. (Reuters) (The New York Times) (The Moscow Times) (BBC)
