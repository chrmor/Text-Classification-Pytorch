UK police attending incident on plane at Heathrow
LONDON (Reuters) - British police boarded an Emirates plane bound for Dubai at London’s Heathrow airport on Friday to deal with an “incident”, an airport spokesman said.
Police said the airport remained open and could not confirm media reports of arrests or the nature of the incident.
Sky News, quoting witnesses, said a passenger had made “verbal threats” just before take off, resulting in the grounding of the plane.
Armed police with sniffer dogs had boarded the plane, due to take off around 2000 GMT (3p.m. EST), and removed one or two passengers, Sky said.
“There’s an incident ongoing on a plane at Heathrow,” the airport spokesman said.
Airports around the world have been on high alert since a failed bombing attempt on a Detroit-bound plane last month.
