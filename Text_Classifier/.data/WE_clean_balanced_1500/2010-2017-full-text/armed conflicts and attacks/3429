Syria: At least seven killed and eight missing in another Médecins Sans Frontières -supported hospital attack in Idlib province
The hospital in Ma’arat Al Numan was hit by four missiles in two attacks within a few minutes of each other, according to staff from the hospital. Around 15 other houses and structures located in populated zones were struck in the area, including reports of another non- Médecins Sans Frontières -supported hospital during Monday morning. 
Five patients were killed, as well as one caretaker. In addition, a hospital guard was killed and eight members of staff are missing, presumed dead. Other patients are still missing, but their numbers are currently unknown. “The destruction of the hospital leaves the local population of around 40,000 people without access to medical services in an active zone of conflict,” Massimiliano Rebaudengo, Médecins Sans Frontières’ Head of Mission, said.  There were also reports on Monday morning of another two hospitals in Azaz city being attacked. These facilities were not supported by Médecins Sans Frontières.
