Gas explosion causes havoc in central Russia (PHOTO, VIDEO) — RT World News
At least three people died and 13 were injured after a powerful gas explosion ripped through a block of flats in the Russian city of Ryazan. The blast ripped through several floors, practically destroying flats and raining concrete blocks on cars parked below.
“A total of 16 people were injured, three of whom died, while 13 needed medical care. Four were hospitalized, and outpatient care was provided to nine others,” TASS news agency was told by the local branch of Russia’s Emergencies and Disaster Response service.
Earlier reports suggested 16 people were injured and three had died.
Photos and videos of the devastated apartment block in Ryazan, a city some 200 kilometers southeast of Moscow, emerged early Sunday, with the incident taking place late at night.
Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the blast, which is thought to be a likely household gas explosion.
Three of the 16 people injured were found in their flats, the Russian Emergencies Ministry said, adding that a child was among the injured.
At least 60 people had to be placed in a nearby school as a temporary shelter as experts are assessing the damage dealt to the building.
