China hotel fire kills 10
BEIJING, Jan. 13 (UPI) -- A fire broke out early Thursday in a hotel in China's Hunan province, killing at least 10 people, officials said.
The blaze was reported about 1 a.m. in the small Xinawan Hotel in the Yuelu district of the province's capital of Changsha, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Six of the victims died at the scene and four of the eight injured later died in a hospital, the report said, quoting a statement from the local government. The other four injured were reported in stable condition.
Most of the victims died of smoke inhalation as the hotel rooms windows had been shut for the winter, fire officials said. They said 50 of the hotel residents were evacuated.
It took firemen more than an hour to put out the blaze.
The cause of the fire was being investigated.
