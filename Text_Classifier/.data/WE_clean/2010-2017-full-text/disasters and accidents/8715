Death toll in India quake rises to 98
THE death toll from a 6.9-magnitude quake that hit the India-Nepal border has risen to 98 and officials warn more bodies are likely to be found.
At least 65 people were killed in India's north-eastern state of Sikkim in Sunday's quake, state official Sonam Lepcha said in Gangtok, where fatalities were being brought in from outlying areas.
"Bodies are being airlifted by various agencies and are being brought to the various district hospitals," she said.
"We fear that more lives have been lost but it is very difficult to give an exact count."
Police said 18 people were killed elsewhere in India, while eight people died in Nepal, and China's official Xinhua news agency reported seven dead in southern Tibet.
Tremors were felt more than 1000km away in New Delhi to the west, and in Bangladesh to the south.
