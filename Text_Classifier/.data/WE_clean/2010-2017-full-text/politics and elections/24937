(CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination after a disappointing finish in New Hampshire, he formally announced in a Facebook post Wednesday.

The decision marks a sudden end for someone once seen as a potential front-runner. In the wake of the 2012 election, Christie appeared poised for a strong bid for the Republican nomination -- he won a second term as the Republican governor of a blue state and led the Republican Governors Association, giving him a perch to travel the nation fundraising for other Republicans and building his stature.
two lanes onto the George Washington Bridge But shortly after he was elected to his second term in November 2013, he was engulfed by the "Bridgegate" scandal. Emails and texts from top aides show they requested that two lanes onto the George Washington Bridge be shut down in September 2013, causing massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, after the town's Democratic mayor declined to endorse Christie's re-election.
had many wondering whether his campaign A federal investigation determined that Christie had no knowledge of the decision to close the lanes, but the political damage was real. By the time he announced his bid at the end of June 2015, the damage from "Bridgegate" had many wondering whether his campaign was dead from the start.
But Donald Trump's ascendance over the summer quickly sucked the air out of the room for almost any other political narrative, including "Bridgegate."
according to NECN's candidate tracker Christie, meanwhile, embarked on a tenacious strategy focused almost exclusively on winning New Hampshire. By February 8, he had made 190 stops in New Hampshire, more than any other candidate, according to NECN's candidate tracker
That attention to the first-in-the-nation primary state paid off in December, when Christie won the endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader. At the same time, he won 2016's somewhat informal mark of arrival â€” withering attacks from Trump.
Christie often talked of his personal experience on September 11, 2001, waiting anxiously for his wife to return from lower Manhattan. But after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino last year, Christie began telling that personal story more, as well as playing up his experience as a federal prosecutor immediately after September 11.

told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" "I think the whole race changed last night. Because you know there was a march among the chattering class to anoint Sen. Rubio," Christie told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" one day after the debate. "I think after last night, that's over. So I think there could be four or five tickets out of New Hampshire because the race is so unsettled now."
