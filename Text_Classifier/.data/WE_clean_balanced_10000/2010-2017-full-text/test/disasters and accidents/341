All Davao flights cancelled due to runway obstruction
MANILA (2nd UPDATE) – All flights to and from Davao City International Airport were cancelled Monday as the airplane which skidded off the airport's runway has yet to be removed.
All flights remain affected after a Cebu Pacific plane skidded off the runway at around 7:15 p.m. on Sunday. The obstruction has left hundreds of passengers stranded Monday morning.
Cebu Pacific said flight 5J 971 from Manila to Davao landed safely but veered off to the right of the Davao runway during a heavy downpour.
"All 165 passengers were unhurt and safely shuttled to the terminal, where their needs were taken care of," Cebu Pacific said, amid complaints from several passengers of lousy accommodation and allegations that it was not the captain but the first officer who was in control of the plane.
The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), meanwhile, has launched an investigation into the incident.
CAAP said the plane will remain on the runway until the investigation finishes. It said the airport's runway will remain closed until 8 p.m. today.
On its official Twitter account, Cebu Pacific said at least 20 of its flights to and from Davao have been cancelled.
"Cebu Pacific arranged for 10 extra roundtrip flights between Manila and General Santos, four extra flights between Cebu and General Santos, one extra flight between Iloilo and General Santos and one extra flight between Zamboanga and General Santos to re-accommodate affected passengers," Cebu Pacific said.
