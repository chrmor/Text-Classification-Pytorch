Chilean poet Gonzalo Rojas dies at age 93
Chilean poet Gonzalo Rojas, regarded as one of Latin America's greatest modern writers, has died in Santiago at the age of 93, his family has announced.
He won numerous literary prizes, including the 2003 Cervantes Prize, the top award for Spanish-language literature.
Rojas was forced into exile for some years after the 1973 military coup led by Gen Augusto Pinochet.
Rojas had been in a serious condition since suffering a stroke in February.
His death was a "great loss for Chilean literature", Education Minister Joaquin Lavin said.
Rojas produced a huge body of work, with his poems translated into several languages.
His works included The Misery of Man, Against Death, Dark and On Lightning.
