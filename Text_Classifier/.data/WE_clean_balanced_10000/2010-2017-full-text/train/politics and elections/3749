Following Pentagon report, Gates urges passage of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ repeal – CNN Political Ticker
(CNN) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday the long awaited Pentagon report on the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy indicates that over two-thirds of service members do not object to gays and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.
Gates urged the Senate to pass a repeal of the policy before it is repealed by "judicial fiat."
