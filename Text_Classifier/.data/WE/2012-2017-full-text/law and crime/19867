3 killed, 12 wounded in gun battle at West Adams restaurant
One neighbor, who identified herself only as Alice, said she has lived at her home for eight years and that as long as she has lived there, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, there are cars parked all along her street, even along stretches of the curb painted red. The street starts filling up in the early afternoon and empties out about 1 a.m., she said.
