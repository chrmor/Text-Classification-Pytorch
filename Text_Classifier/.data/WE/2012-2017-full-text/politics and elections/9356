Obama meets with Pope Francis for the first time at the Vatican
"Given his great moral authority, when the pope speaks, it carries enormous weight," Obama told Corriere della Sera. "He doesn't just proclaim the Gospel, he lives it. We've all been moved by his humility and acts of mercy. His deeds, the simple act of reaching out to the least of these, is a reminder that every one of us has an individual responsibility to live in a righteous way."
