Foreign ministers from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia discuss human trafficking, SE Asia News & Top Stories
PUTRAJAYA - Foreign ministers from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand held talks in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday on human trafficking.
The focus of the meeting was on "the issue of irregular movement of people, in particular human trafficking,'' Bernama news agency reported.
The talks involved Malaysia's Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman and his Thailand counterpart General Tanasak Patimapragorn, who is also Thai Deputy Prime Minister, and Indonesia's Retno Marsudi.
Wednesday's meeting came amid a human trafficking crisis in South-east Asia. Nearly 3,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar and Bangladeshi migrants have made it ashore in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia in recent days after being abandoned by smugglers in open waters.
In a statement, Malaysia said it remains committed to working closely with affected countries and members of the international community in resolving the issue in the region, Bernama reported.
"Malaysia will continue to seek a solution on the issue through, inter alia, concerted and coordinated efforts among the countries of origin, transit and destination," it said.
It was reported that 1,158 Bangladeshi migrants and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, including women and children, landed illegally by boat in Langkawi, Kedah on May 10. The number is reportedly the largest to date.
