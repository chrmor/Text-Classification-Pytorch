Branson gives Virgin a new name
Sir Richard said the Virgin Australia brand represented a new chapter for the airline: ''I'm absolutely thrilled with the new look and feel of Virgin Australia's domestic product and I know it will shake up the Australian travel market on a larger scale than it did 10 years ago.''
The rolling out of Sir Richard, the largest shareholder in the renamed Virgin Australia, comes as the airline confronts some of the toughest market conditions since it was launched in August 2000.
The airline has also successfully negotiated the renaming of its longhaul off-shoots V Australia and Pacific Blue, with both to be rebranded Virgin Australia.
A licensing agreement between Singapore Airlines and Sir Richard – the two shareholders of British long-haul airline Virgin Atlantic – had given them the right of veto over the use of the moniker on airlines which fly internationally.
Sir Richard has previously said it would be ‘‘nice to have a unified brand’’ for the various airlines associated with his aviation interests.
