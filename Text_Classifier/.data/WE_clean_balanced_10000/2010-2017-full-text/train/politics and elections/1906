Ukraine Bans Russian Movies As Threat To National Security
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has signed legislation banning all Russian films made after January 1, 2014.
Legislation signed by President Petro Poroshenko on April 20 also bans movies produced by Russia after 1991 if they "glorify the work of government bodies" of Russia.
"The legislation will help raise the level of protection of Ukraine's national security, reduce separatist sentiments in society, and strengthen the government's authority," a parliamentary description of the bill was quoted as saying.
Russian films and television series have long dominated the Ukrainian market where an overwhelming majority of the population is bilingual. Ukrainian and Russian TV channels have also been engaged in a partnership to coproduce movies and series.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia soured after street protests in Kyiv toppled President Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally, in February 2014. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 and threw its support behind separatists in the countryâ€™s east.
