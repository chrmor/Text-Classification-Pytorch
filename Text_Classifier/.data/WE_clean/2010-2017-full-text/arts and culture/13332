‘Dear Friends’: Pope Takes to Twitter, With an Assist
ROME — After struggling with the touch screen of an iPad, Pope Benedict XVI dispatched his first Twitter message on Wednesday. “Dear friends,” it read, “I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.”
Sitting at a desk in the Vatican hall where he holds his weekly audience, the pontiff, 85, touched the iPad with a wavering hand adorned with a large gold ring, as the audience applauded.
Video footage showed that the pope seemed confused and had trouble hitting “send,” forcing Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, the president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, to step in and touch the screen to send the first papal message.
Last week, the Vatican announced that Benedict, who writes in longhand, would begin posting messages on Twitter in eight languages under the handle @pontifex, a Latin term for pope that means “bridge builder.” Claire Díaz-Ortiz, the director of social innovation at Twitter, was at the ceremony.
Later on Wednesday, the pope responded to questions that included the hashtag #askpontifex. “How can faith in Jesus be lived in a world without hope?” the pope wrote in one post. “By speaking with Jesus in prayer, listening to what he tells you in the Gospel and looking for him in those in need.”
