Baku, May 6, Interfax - On Friday police cut short a demonstration in Azerbaijan's capital against an official ban on female secondary school students wearing hijabs. About 50 people gathered outside the Education Ministry building in Baku and were crying out, "Freedom to the hijab!" the Interior Ministry told Interfax. The demonstration had no official permission and was dispersed by police. Several protesters were arrested but were released after questioning, the ministry said. The hijab is not part of the standard uniform that all female school students are required to wear under an order by Education Minister Misir Mardanov.
