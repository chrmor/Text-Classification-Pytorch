Conservative Party in Croatia Wins Parliamentary Elections
ZAGREB, Croatia — The conservative Croatian Democratic Union won the most seats in parliamentary elections held in Croatia on Sunday, but the country looked set for long negotiations among potential coalition partners after voters once again declined to return a clear governing majority.
With all of the votes counted, the party, known as H.D.Z., had 61 seats, pushing the Social Democrats into second place with 54. But it was still short of a majority in the 151-seat Parliament, even with the support of the center-right Most party, or Bridge, whose 13 seats make it a likely kingmaker.
In a sign of voter disillusionment, turnout plunged, and Zivi Zid, or Human Shield, a populist left alliance, surged from one seat to eight by promising to be tough on banks and demanding the prosecution of unnamed corrupt officials.
The H.D.Z. seems best placed to form a government, but it could be difficult for any party to build a coalition with a clear mandate to carry out the painful public administration changes being urged on this country of 4.3 million.
“I am sure that we are the party that will have the privilege of forming a stable government for the next four years,” said Andrej Plenkovic, who was recently made leader of the H.D.Z.
The previous government, a coalition between the H.D.Z. and Most, collapsed after five months amid disputes over overhauls and government appointments.
