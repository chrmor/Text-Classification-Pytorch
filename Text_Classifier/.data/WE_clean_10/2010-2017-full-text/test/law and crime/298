DC police arrest 19-year-old man in drive-by shooting that injured 13
D.C. police have made an arrest in a drive-by shooting that injured 13 people standing outside an apartment building.
Police say 19-year-old Craig Wilson of southeast Washington was arrested Friday by members of a fugitive task force. He's been charged in a warrant with assault with intent to kill.
Wilson was one of two young men police wanted to question in the shooting, which occurred shortly after 2 a.m. Monday. Police say shots were fired from at least one car that sped by a crowd of people standing outside a northwest Washington apartment complex. A nearby nightclub had just closed for the night.
Police have also found the Mercedes coupe they were looking for in connection with the shooting. They're still seeking 19-year-old Andrew Allen for questioning.
