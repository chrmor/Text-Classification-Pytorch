South Korea nuclear plant hacked, says operator
Seoul: Computer systems at South Korea's nuclear plant operator have been hacked, the company said on Monday, sharply raising concerns about safeguards around nuclear facilities in a country that remains technically at war with North Korea.
The Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co Ltd (KHNP) and the government said only "non-critical" data was stolen by the hackers, and that there was no risk to nuclear installations, including the country's 23 atomic reactors.
But the hacking was reported as the United States accused North Korea of a devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures.
Experts voiced alarm that the controls of the nuclear reactors could be at risk.
