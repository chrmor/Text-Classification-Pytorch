At least one dead in building collapse in historic Cairo neighbourhood
At least one man was killed when a three-storey building in a historic Cairo neighbourhood tumbled down on Monday, state news agency MENA reported.
Security forces cordoned off the area where the building once stood in Al-Khalifa district in southern Cairo.
The body of a 20-year-old man was pulled out from under the rubble as rescue workers continued their search for survivors.
Cairo governorate has said that local officials in the populous neighbourhood face challenges, as the area is home to a large number of old, dilapidated buildings.
The governorateâ€™s official website states that it continuously monitors the conditions of such buildings.
The area hosts some of Cairo's oldest Islamic mosques and historic sites such as Ahmed Ibn-Toulon mosque and Al-Sultan Hassan mosque.
Building collapses are commonplace in Egypt and are usually attributed to violations of building specifications, illegal extensions, and lax government oversight.
