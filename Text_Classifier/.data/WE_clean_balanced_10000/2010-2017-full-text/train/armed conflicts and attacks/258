U.S. Drone Strikes Pakistan as Sharif Names Cabinet
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least seven people were killed late Friday when an American drone fired three missiles at a house in northwestern Pakistan, according to an intelligence official, hours after the country’s new prime minister announced his cabinet.
During his campaign, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif often criticized the United States for using drone aircraft to kill militants.
The drones that struck Friday targeted a house in Mangroti village in the Shawal area of North Waziristan, the tribal region straddling the border with Afghanistan. The identities of the victims were not immediately known, but an intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described them as militants.
Shawal links North Waziristan with the South Waziristan tribal region and is a stronghold of militants of all stripes.
Hours before the strike, Mr. Sharif announced his 25-member cabinet, a team of close aides who will work to solve Pakistan’s entrenched economic, social and security problems.
