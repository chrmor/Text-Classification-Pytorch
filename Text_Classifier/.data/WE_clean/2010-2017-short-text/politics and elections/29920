Voters head to the polls to select the National Assembly and a new president with former vice-president Len√≠n Moreno facing off against former bank president Guillermo Lasso, and six other opposition candidates. There will be an April 2 runoff unless the leader receives 40 percent of the votes and is at least 10 percentage points ahead of the others. In addition, there's a tax haven referendum. (Reuters)
