Sweden's prime minister falls short of majority in election
Mr Reinfeldt's four-party Alliance gained one extra seat at the expense of the left-wing opposition after votes cast by Swedes living abroad were counted, leaving it with 173, two short of a majority, election authorities said.
Mr Reinfeldt, whose bloc took 49.28 per cent of the vote, must now seek alliances with left wing opposition parties to form a government.
He has already ruled out any deal with the far-right Sweden Democrats, which enter parliament for the first time with 20 seats.
The Social Democrats and their left wing opposition coalition partners, the Greens, and the formerly communist Left Party took 43.6 per cent and 156 seats, while the Sweden Democrats won 5.7 per cent of the vote.
Mr Reinfeldt and other party leaders have kept a low profile since Monday, saying they would wait to discuss the future government make-up and possible new alliances until after the final results.
Discussions were expected to pick up on Friday, but a new government is not expected to be announced until October 5 at the earliest.
Sweden is now the third previously stable Western European country since June to be without a governing majority after elections, following The Netherlands and Belgium.
