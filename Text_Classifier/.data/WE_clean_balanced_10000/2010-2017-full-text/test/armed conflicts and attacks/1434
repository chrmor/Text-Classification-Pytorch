Cross-border Taliban attack martyrs three Pak troops
KHAR: Militants martyred at least three Pak soldiers in an attack early on Saturday on a border post in the restive northwestern tribal belt, officials said.
Around two dozen militants armed with sophisticated weapons crossed from the Afghan province of Kunar to launch the pre-dawn ambush in Bajaur district, Pakistan officials said.
“Militants from across the border ambushed a check post. Two security personnel and an officer embraced martyrdom in the attack,” a security official in Bajaur told AFP by telephone.
“One sepoy (soldier) and a civilian were also wounded,” the official added.
A senior government official said the militants were forced to flee after troops retaliated.
No group has yet claimed responsibility but both officials said TTP militants were involved in the attack.
“It might be in retaliation for the Pakistan military offensive in North Waziristan,” the government official told AFP.
