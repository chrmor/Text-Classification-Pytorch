Egypt Court Outlaws Hamas and Brands Muslim Brotherhood Offshoot as Terrorists
An Egyptian court has banned all Hamas activities in Egypt and closed the Palestinian militant group's offices in the country, according to an unnamed judge.
The group controls the neighbouring Gaza Strip in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and represents an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, whom the interim government has classified as a terrorist group since the overthrow of its leader, Mohamed Morsi, from the presidency last year.
"The court has ordered the banning of Hamas work and activities in Egypt," the judge told Reuters.
Hamas condemned the court's decision, accusing Egyptian officials of trying to damage the Palestinian cause.
Egyptian officials view Hamas as a security threat on the country's border, accusing the group of supporting al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, allegations that the group denies.
The case was filed by Egyptian lawyers who requested that Hamas activities be banned and the group designated as a terrorist organisation.
Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders are being held in detention in Egypt on a variety of charges, including two cases involving Hamas members.
One case accuses Hamas militants of aiding Morsi in his escape from prison in 2011 and the other case accuses Morsi and other Brotherhood members of leaking state secrets to Hamas.
Egyptian officials have previously hinted that they wish to remove Hamas from Gaza, supporting rivals Fatah and anti-Hamas activities in the occupied strip.
Since coming to power last summer, Egypt's military-backed government has hindered Gaza's economy by closing 1,200 smuggling tunnels into the occupied territory used to import food, cars and weapons.
