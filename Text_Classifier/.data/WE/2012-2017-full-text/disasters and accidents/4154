Flooding fears as Bopha returns to Philippines
Killer storm Bopha is set to make landfall in the Philippines for a second time, just days after it slammed into the south of the country and left almost 1,400 dead or missing.
Bopha, now downgraded from a typhoon to a tropical storm, changed course after heading into the South China Sea and is heading towards the main Philippines island of Luzon.
Despite being weaker, with 55 kilometre per hour winds, the storm brought heavy rain and concerns of landslides and flash flooding with its return.
"It will bring rain, not so much wind," civil defence chief Benito Ramos told AFP.
"We anticipate flash floods and landslides. We expect low-lying areas to be flooded again."
Local relief and rescue teams and the military were in position while residents were on alert for rising waters.
Meanwhile, search and rescue operations continue in the south-eastern region where Bopha first struck the country.
Since the typhoon first struck last week, 548 people have been confirmed dead and around 800 are still missing.
Most of the deaths were in the southern island of Mindanao where mountainous gold-rush sites were hit hard.
Almost 178,000 people remain in crowded government evacuation centres after their homes were destroyed.
Mr Ramos said the massive death toll in Mindanao had made residents in the north more cautious.
"They are more alert now," he said.
"They were watching developments in the south where we incurred a substantial number of casualties and they were alarmed."
Six Air Force helicopters have been brought in to speed up the search for the missing while more heavy equipment has been sent to clear roads leading to isolated communities in Compostela Valley and Davao provinces.
