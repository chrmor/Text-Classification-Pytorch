Baseball star Alex Rodriguez banned for 211 games
Alex Rodriguez, baseball's highest-paid player and one of the sport's greatest hitters, was suspended for a record 211 games on Monday for alleged doping offences.
Another 12 players, including three All-Stars, were handed 50-game suspensions by Major League Baseball following a long investigation into links between top players and a Florida clinic accused of supplying performance enhancing drugs.
Rodriguez insists he will fight the ban.
"I am disappointed with the penalty and intend to appeal and fight this through the process," he said.
