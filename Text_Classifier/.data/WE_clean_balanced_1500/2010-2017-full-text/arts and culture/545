Timothy M. Dolan to Lead Catholic Bishops’ Conference
Archbishop Dolan also suggested that he would not countenance other Catholic leaders and organizations when they take public positions that contradict the bishops. That is what happened this year when some groups representing Catholic and nuns came out in support of the health care overhaul bill, despite the bishops’ staunch opposition.
“We’re pastors and teachers,” Archbishop Dolan said of the bishops’ role, “not just one set of teachers in the Catholic community, but the teachers.”
Archbishop Dolan’s election consolidates the gradual shift in leadership and priorities for the bishops’ conference, which from the 1970s through the 1990s issued decrees on more traditionally liberal concerns like economic inequality, workers rights, the environment and peace. While the bishops still do take up issues like immigration and poverty, they are far more focused on shaping public policy to stop abortion and prevent the legalization of marriage between same-sex couples.
The bishops also set a decidedly conservative direction this year in their choice of a vice president to replace Bishop Kicanas. They elected Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of , Ky., who is chairman of the bishops’ committee on marriage and an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions. The runner-up was Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of , who is a theological traditionalist and a political conservative. The tally was 147 votes for Archbishop Kurtz and 91 for Archbishop Chaput.
“This is a signal that the conference wants to be a leader in the culture wars,” said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown. “The two vice-presidential finalists were the two most conservative on the ballot. That says something about where this conference is going.”
The final vote for president, after 10 candidates were narrowed to two, was 128 for Archbishop Dolan and 111 for Bishop Kicanas. Three years ago, when the same two men were finalists for vice president, Bishop Kicanas defeated Archbishop Dolan by two votes, according to the Catholic News Service.
Robert P. George, a professor of jurisprudence at and an adviser to some of the bishops on political and moral issues: “You could imagine a different approach where the bishops would say, ‘This guy is too combative. We need someone more conciliatory.’ They didn’t do that.”
Professor George noted that Archbishop Dolan was the host of the meetings that produced the “ Declaration,” a manifesto issued last year by prominent evangelical, Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders to reignite and unify religious opposition to abortion, and what the leaders considered as threats to religious freedom. Mr. George, who helped to draft the document, said Archbishop Dolan was one of the original signers.
It was impossible to tell whether the bishops were influenced by a last-minute lobbying campaign against Bishop Kicanas that was mounted by conservative Catholic bloggers, who accused him of being soft on abortion and homosexuality and of allowing a seminarian who was accused of sexual abuse to be ordained as a priest.
Several advocacy groups for victims of sexual abuse by priests had lobbied against Bishop Kicanas and Archbishop Dolan, saying both were involved in covering up abuse cases.
The has no direct role in the bishops’ vote, but had expressed its confidence in Archbishop Dolan this year by appointing him to a panel that was investigating seminaries in , which has been devastated by the sexual abuse scandal.
Archbishop Dolan has led the church in New York since April 2009. Before then, he was archbishop of , where he served for seven years. In New York, he has a full plate of challenges, including a budget-cutting effort that will close dozens of churches and parishes.
He has been chairman for three years of Catholic Relief Services, the bishops’ charity arm, and he traveled to several times after the earthquake in January to observe the church’s relief efforts there. (He stepped down on Tuesday as leader of the relief agency.)
Speaking of Archbishop Dolan’s strengths, Bishop Salvatore J. Cordileone of said, “Not that many people can combine that intellectual depth and that jolly, outgoing personality.”
In an upbeat news conference, Archbishop Dolan said his differences with Bishop Kicanas are matters of style and not substance. He said the bishops rejected the idea that they were divided left and right, between the “social justice” and “pro-life” camps.
“The bishops see those as part of a package deal. It’s not a cleavage between the two,” he said.
He said that the battle over the health care overhaul had put the bishops in a “delicate position.”
“We should have been doing cartwheels” when the health care bill passed, he said, because the bishops had long supported expanding coverage. But he said the bishops could not endorse the legislation because they concluded there were “unborn babies that were in danger.”
