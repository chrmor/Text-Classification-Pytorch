Mumbai building collapse rescue ends with 60 dead
The rescue operation at a four-storey building that collapsed on Friday in the Indian city of Mumbai has been called off, with the final death toll put at 60.
Rescuers saved 33 people from the rubble of the building near Dockyard Road in the east of the city.
The last to be found alive was a 50-year-old man pulled out on Saturday.
The collapse is the latest in a series in Mumbai. Poor construction practices have been blamed in earlier incidents.
Alok Awasthi, local commander of the National Disaster Response Force, said all people thought to have been in the building had now been accounted for and the operation ended on Sunday morning.
Rescuers equipped with cranes had searched the rubble since Friday's collapse.
They dragged a young girl alive from the the ruins nearly 12 hours after the collapse and the 50-year-old man was pulled out on Saturday with serious injuries after a six-hour effort.
The cause of the collapse is not yet known.
The building had been home to more than 20 families of employees of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.
Officials say the municipality asked the residents to vacate the property earlier this year.
Property prices and rent in Mumbai are among the highest in Asia. Many citizens are forced to live in old, dilapidated properties in a land-scarce city.
More than 100 people have been killed in five building collapses in Mumbai between April and June alone.
And between 2008 and 2012, there were 100 building collapses in the city in which 53 people died and 103 others were injured, authorities say.
