Pakistan drone attacks kill '13 militants'
Three separate attacks carried out by a suspected drone have killed at least 13 militants in north-west Pakistan, local officials said.
The missiles struck hours apart in the North Waziristan tribal region. The dead included five foreign nationals.
The lawless region, a haven for members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, has been repeatedly targeted by US drones.
More than 70 drone strikes have killed over 200 people in North and South Waziristan since the start of 2010.
In the first attack, officials say that missiles were fired at a vehicle in the Qutab Khel area of Miran Shah, the region's main town. Reports said the five dead insurgents were from Uzbekistan.
In the second attack, missiles struck a house and a vehicle in Khaso Khel village near Mir Ali, killing four suspected militants.
Four missiles fired in the third strike hit a vehicle in Pai Khel village in Datta Khel town killing four militants, officials said.
Pakistan publicly criticises drone attacks, saying they fuel support for militants. But observers say officials privately condone the strikes.
The US military and CIA do not routinely confirm that they have launched drone operations, but analysts say only US forces have deployed such aircraft in the region.
