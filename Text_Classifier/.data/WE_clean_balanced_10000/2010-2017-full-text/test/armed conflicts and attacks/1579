Fidel Castro Condemns Attack on U .S. Congresswoman
Fidel Castro has denounced as "atrocious" a shooting attack on a U.S. lawmaker that left six people dead and the legislator in critical condition.
The Cuban revolutionary icon says in an opinion piece that even those, like him, who frequently disagree with the United States would never want to see violence like the attack Saturday in Tucson, Arizona, that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat, fighting for her life.
The dead included a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl. Thirteen people were wounded, 10 seriously.
"Even those of us who don't share at all the politics and philosophies (of the Obama administration) sincerely desire that no children, judges, legislators or citizens of the United States die in such an absurd and unjustifiable way," Castro wrote Sunday in a state media article.
