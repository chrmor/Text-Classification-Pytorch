Charges Against Leader Leave IMF Job in Limbo
WASHINGTONâ€”The arrest of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, on attempted rape charges complicates European debt bailout negotiations and raises questions about who will eventually get the top job at the fund.
Guilty or not, former and current IMF officials say they expect Mr. Strauss-Kahn, also a presidential hopeful in France, to step aside because of the gravity of the charges. He can't continue his work on the European debt crisis while in custody in New York.
