Following Golden State's NBA Championship win over Cleveland Tuesday night, Andre Iguodala was named the Most Valuable Player.
Remarkably, Iguodala had not started a game this season until the Warriors reached Game 3 of the Finals. He more than delivered, averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and four assists in the series. His 25-point performance in Game 6 was a season high after he scored 22 in Game 4.
The 31-year-old won the award by a 7-4 vote over Cleveland's LeBron James, who Igudoala was tasked with guarding for much of the series. James averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the series for the short-handed Cavaliers.
Golden State's NBA Championship is the franchise's first in 40 years.
