Stars give songs for Philippines
Stars including Beyonce and Adele are among those who have donated tracks to an album that will raise money for the Philippines Red Cross.
The digital album of 39 songs also includes tracks from The Beatles, One Direction, U2, Lady Gaga and Bob Dylan.
The artists, record companies and music publishers have agreed to donate all proceeds from the record.
The death toll from Typhoon Haiyan has now risen above 5,000. The huge storm hit the Philippines on 8 November.
Songs donated include The Beatles' Let It Be, Josh Groban's Brave, I Believe in You by Kylie Minogue, Madonna's Like A Prayer and Eminem's Stan.
Bruno Mars, Michael Buble, Alicia Keys, Katie Perry, Enrique Iglesias, Muse, Lorde, Kings of Leon, Ellie Goulding and Lily Allen have also contributed tracks.
Huge numbers - including many children - were left homeless after Typhoon Haiyan hit. Many are now living in cramped, unhygienic conditions in damaged buildings.
Around 33,000 children are now being immunised against measles and polio in the typhoon-hit city of Tacloban.
