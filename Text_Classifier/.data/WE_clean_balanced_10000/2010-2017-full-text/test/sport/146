Socceroos' Tom Rogic becomes Celtic legend with Scottish Cup final winner
Tom Rogic has admitted his Scottish Cup final winner was what dreams are made of after his stoppage-time solo goal clinched the treble for Celtic.
The Socceroos midfielder glided into the penalty box and beat several players before squeezing a right-footed shot past Joe Lewis to clinch a 2-1 victory over Aberdeen.
The goal sealed Celtic's fourth treble in its history and provided a memorable end to an unforgettable season in which the Hoops remained unbeaten in 47 domestic games.
"I picked up the ball and just tried to be positive and space just opened up for me. It was a pretty special moment," Rogic said.
"It's been a long season and to do what we have done as a collective group, go unbeaten and then to seal it like that, to get the treble in the last minute of the last game of the season is something we will look back on forever."
Rogic started the game on the bench but came on in the 27th minute after Kieran Tierney went off with an injury to his mouth after being caught by Jayden Stockley's flailing arm.
And the substitute admitted fate may have intervened as he struck the winner just as a bolt of lightning lit up the sky over Hampden amid a thunderstorm.
"Someone just told me that but I didn't realise at the time," the 24-year-old said. "Maybe it was meant to be."
