Looters arrested as police order Christchurch curfew
Six people have been arrested for looting in Christchurch, as police set up a curfew in the devastated central city.
Superintendent Dave Cliff said there would be a 6.30pm curfew inside the central business district, allowing access only to those involved in the rescue effort, NZPA reported.
"That's also about keeping out the criminal element, who we know will try and take advantage," he said.
"We have made about six arrests today for theft and burglary around the central city."
Australian police officers will be on hand to help stop looters.
"They will be there to provide support in general law and order, to ensure that general safety is being attended to and also to assist in tragedies like this," NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said.
