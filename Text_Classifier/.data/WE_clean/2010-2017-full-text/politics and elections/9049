Sarkozy says Greece aid awaits plan adoption
SYDNEY (MarketWatch) -- French president Nicolas Sarkozy said late Wednesday that a sixth tranche of aid won't be paid to Greece unless the country decides to adopt the European proposals outlined last week to help the region out of its sovereign debt crisis, according to reports. The Greek prime minister said early this week that there would be a confidence vote and a referendum on the proposals, taking markets -- which had believed the euro zone was in agreement over the deal -- by surprise. Sarkozy said Wednesday that, if Greece does hold a referendum, it must take place as quickly as possible and is now expected to be held on Dec. 4 and 5, according to the reports. German chancellor Angela Merkel added that the proposals outlined last week will be speeded up and that Europe is prepared in the event that Greece decides to exit the euro, the reports said. Both Sarkozy and Merkel were speaking after emergency talks held with Greek prime minister George Papandreou in Cannes ahead of the Group of 20 summit.
