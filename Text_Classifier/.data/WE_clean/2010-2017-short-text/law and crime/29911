Honduran authorities arrest four men in the March 3 home invasion killing of Goldman Environmental Prize-winning environmental activist Berta Cáceres. One of the suspects was an active duty army officer while the others worked for Desarrollos Energeticos SA, whose hydroelectric project Cáceres had opposed since 2006. The four also face charges on the attempted murder of Mexican environmental activist Gustavo Castro Soto, who was injured in the attack. (AP) (The Guardian)
