Qantas is considering cancelling flights to Jakarta today due to the risk posed by ash clouds from the recent eruption of Mount Merapi.
Several other international airlines have already cancelled flights to the Indonesian capital because of fears that volcanic ash could damage aircraft engines.
Mount Merapi, on Central Java, first started erupting on October 26, a day after a tsunami killed more than 400 people in a remote area off Sumatra island.
Qantas says its assessment will be based on weather forecasts over the next few hours.
Some international flights have been diverted to other airports, although domestic flights appear largely unaffected.
"Thirty-six flights to and from Jakarta from 11 airlines have been cancelled," Sudaryanto, a spokesman for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, said overnight.
"I think it's for safety reasons due to the volcanic ash from Merapi.
"Safety is good, but actually the ash hasn't reached Jakarta."
The volcano, which is 430 kilometres from Jakarta, has so far killed more than 120 people.
It is still ejecting plumes of ash and superheated gases with molten debris falling nearby.
About 200,000 people have been evacuated from the area.
