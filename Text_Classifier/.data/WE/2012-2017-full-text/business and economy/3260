China trade complaint challenges U.S. anti-dumping measures
WASHINGTON -- China filed a World Trade Organization complaint Monday challenging U.S. anti-dumping measures on billions of dollars in goods as trade tensions escalated between the two economic superpowers.
The move came as the Obama administration said Monday it was complaining to the WTO that China was illegally subsidizing exports of automobiles and auto parts.
President Obama was set to announce the move while campaigning in Ohio, a key battleground in the November election and a state that has a large auto industry. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Obama for not being tougher on China, which Romney said has been "cheating" on trade rules.
The WTO said China's complaint covered a wide range of products that China exports to the U.S, including kitchen appliances, paper, steel, tires, magnets, chemicals, wood flooring and wind towers.
