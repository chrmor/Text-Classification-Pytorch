Romania, Hungary sign agreement on opening cross-border roads
The governments of Romania and Hungary have signed a framework agreement for opening 20 cross-border roads, including five in Arad (western Romania), County Council chairman Nicolae Iotcu announced in a press conference on Tuesday.
Vice prime minister and minister of regional development and public administration Liviu Dragnea signed on behalf of Romania; Iotcu mentioned that the roads connect Nadlac to Csanadpalota, Pecica to Battonya, Variasu Mic to Dombegyhaza, Graniceri to Elek, and Iermata Neagra to Denesmajor (all pairs of Romania and Hungary, respectively); they allow the traffic of passengers and of freight up to 3.5 tonnes.
‘We are glad about Romania’s Government respecting our work and efforts – both of Arad County Council and of local administrations – which strengthened the road links with Hungary, and implicitly with the European Union. Thus, Arad has new opportunities of economic and tourist development, as the free movement of people, services, goods and capitals is a fundamental principle of the European Union,’ said Iotcu.
The agreement has been sent to the Hungarian government for ratification; it will come into force 30 days after the last mutual notification of the two governments about the completion of all the necessary internal procedures.
‘It’s worth mentioning that the free access of individuals, vehicles, merchandise and other goods will be possible when Romania joins the Schengen [Area], except for festive moments, which require special approvals. Until then, these roads will have barriers and obstacles on the territory of both states,’ added the official of Arad.
