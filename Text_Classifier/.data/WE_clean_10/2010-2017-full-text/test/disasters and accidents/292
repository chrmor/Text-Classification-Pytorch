London Fire: High-Rise Apartment Blaze Kills at Least 12, Injures 78
Another witness, Samira Lamrani, said a woman wrapped a baby up "in some sort of thick blanket" and then let go of the child from around the ninth floor. "Miraculously, the baby just sort of dropped in a straight line, and a guy just ran forward and the baby fell into his arms," she said.
Several others recounted watching people jumping from Grenfell Tower to escape the flames and smoke.
Local officials said they believed that several hundred people were in the building, which dates to the 1970s. The high-rise had a "stay put" policy in the event of a fire â€” with residents urged to shut their windows and doors and await rescue.
London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton called it an "unprecedented incident," adding that a "number of fatalities" had been confirmed. Police later put the death toll at six, but they warned that the figure was likely to rise.
"In my 29 years of being a firefighter, I have never, ever seen anything of this scale," Cotton said. "This is a major fire that's affected all floors of the 24-story structure from the second floor upwards."
She highlighted that "very large numbers" were rescued by emergency crews early on. But almost nine hours after the blaze broke out, Cotton said "we have absolutely no idea" how many people remained unaccounted for.
Michael Paramasivan, 37, was wearing only underwear and a robe when he fled the seventh floor about 35 minutes after the blaze was reported.
He described the scene in the stairwell as an "absolute horror story."
"There was smoke everywhere, people screaming and shouting," Paramasivan told NBC News. "It all happened so fast, but it was really, really frightening. I'm shaking."
He added: "They say you're supposed to put a towel under the door and wait for rescue, but I wasn't going to hang around. ... There was some kind of alarm, but it was barely audible. It certainly wouldn't have woken you up."
