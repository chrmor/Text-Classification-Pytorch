France Attacks to Dominate Agenda at G-20 Conference in Turkey
WASHINGTON — President Obama will consult about the Paris terrorist attacks with world leaders in Turkey this weekend as the annual gathering of presidents and prime ministers from the world’s largest economies there is poised to become an urgent summit meeting on confronting extremism.
The president landed in Turkey on Sunday for a 10-day trip to that nation, the Philippines and Malaysia, after a series of simultaneous attacks in Paris prompted President François Hollande of France to tighten the nation’s border controls and mobilize the military. Before leaving Saturday, Mr. Obama convened a meeting of his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence on the attacks, officials said.
On Friday evening, Mr. Obama called the situation in Paris an “attack on all of humanity” and pledged to do whatever it takes to join the French people in bringing the terrorists to justice. The president arrived Sunday morning in Antalya, Turkey, on the Mediterranean coast, for the Group of 20 summit meeting.
The official economic agenda in Turkey and Asia was already likely to be overshadowed by a series of intense meetings between Mr. Obama and his counterparts about the Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis in Europe, disputes with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and ongoing tensions in the South China Sea.
But the Paris attacks are certain to push even those topics to the side, at least temporarily, as world leaders confront the scale of the terrorist attacks in the French capital. The leaders will grapple with the rising threat of the Islamic State, which Mr. Hollande has blamed for the Paris attacks. American authorities on Saturday did not dispute Mr. Hollande’s assessment or the Islamic State’s own claim of responsibility.
