police flayed
POLICE treated as an accident the death of an eight-year-old Aboriginal boy whose body was found with head injuries and weighted with rocks in a water hole near a remote Northern Territory community.
For almost three years police failed to investigate a possible killer or killers among the 800 residents of Borroloola, an Aboriginal settlement on the McArthur River, about 1000 kilometres south-east of Darwin.
Bungles during the investigation of the death of Kieffen Raggett went unnoticed until the Northern Territory Coroner, Greg Cavanagh, reopened an inquiry two years and 11 months after police had inexplicably classified the death in October 2007 as accidental drowning.
Releasing his findings in Darwin yesterday, Mr Cavanagh said police had overlooked critical avenues of investigation and the circumstances surrounding the death, and compromised or destroyed crime scene evidence.
He found they had ignored ''compelling'' evidence of two sets of footprints that led through bush to the waterhole where Kieffen's body was found two days after he disappeared.
Kieffen's red singlet was found in nearby bush and his footprints did not lead to the point where police wrongly presumed he had fallen from an embankment. Two large rocks were found in his shorts, which Mr Cavanagh said ''could not be explained other than by the intervention of some other party.''
