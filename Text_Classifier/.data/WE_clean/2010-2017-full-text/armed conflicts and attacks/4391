Egyptian authorities moved on Sunday to extend curfew hours in the Arab country amid violence, but thousands continue defying the calls for order, national television said.
The curfew, which was introduced on Friday, has been extended by one hour to start at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) instead of 4 p.m. and will end at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT), the report said.
The Egyptian military urged citizens on Sunday to follow the curfew, warning that fire will be opened against those who refuse to do so. Police started returning to the streets in Cairo to protect public security and property.
Egyptian residents were forced to form vigilante groups armed with sticks to protect their homes, shops and hospitals amid looting which has engulfed the country.
Anti-government protests continued for the sixth day on Sunday in Egypt. At least 150 people have been killed and about 4,000 injured in the riots, Al-Jazeera TV channel said.
