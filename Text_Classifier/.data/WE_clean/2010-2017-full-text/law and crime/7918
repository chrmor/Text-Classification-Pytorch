Eight types of synthetic cannabis set for national ban from tomorrow
EIGHT synthetic cannabis-like substances will be banned throughout Australia from Friday.
The nationwide ban follows earlier prohibitions in NSW, Western Australia and South Australia.
The federal government says the move was prompted by widespread reports of abuse and concern about the effects of the substances, including severe hallucinations, psychosis and heart palpitations.
The drugs mimicked existing illicit substances, parliamentary secretary for health Catherine King said on Thursday.
But they had not been made uniformly illegal across Australia because they fell outside current controls, she said.
As a result, the government had decided to prohibit eight of the most widely used and abused synthetic cannabinoids.
