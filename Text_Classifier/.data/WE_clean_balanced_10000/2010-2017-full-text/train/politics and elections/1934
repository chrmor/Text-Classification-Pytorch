Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has met with former colleagues who disagreed with her election boycott and formed a new party to fight the controversial poll, the breakaway group said.
The one-hour meeting between Ms Suu Kyi and three leaders of the National Democratic Force (NDF) was her first with the group since her release from house arrest following the November vote.
"It was just a personal meeting. We didn't talk about politics. We will meet again," NDF leader Khin Maung Swe said.
The NDF was formed by senior members of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which was disbanded for boycotting the poll.
The breakaway group won 16 seats in the election after fielding 161 candidates but has complained of widespread fraud by the junta-backed party, which has claimed an overwhelming victory.
Khin Maung Swe said last week he had not seen Ms Suu Kyi for about two decades, and that he and his colleagues planned to tell her the NDF was formed "for national reconciliation, as confrontation is not the way to achieve democracy".
Ms Suu Kyi spent much of the last two decades in detention and was locked up and marginalised during Burma's first poll in 20 years on November 7.
Her party won a landslide victory in 1990 but was never allowed to take power.
Ms Suu Kyi said in a recent interview that she wanted dialogue with the government but has heard nothing from the junta so far.
Burma, ruled by the military since 1962, has been condemned by the West for an election critics say was a sham designed to cloak ongoing army rule.
