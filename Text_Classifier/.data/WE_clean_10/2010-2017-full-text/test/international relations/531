Queen's visit to Ireland – Tuesday 17 May 2011
8.30am: The Queen's arrival in Dublin later today has been overshadowed this morning by the news that the Irish army has made safe a bomb near Ireland's capital.
The "viable" improvised explosive device was discovered in the luggage compartment of a bus on the outskirts of Maynooth, Co Kildare, late on Monday night.
A controlled explosion was carried out and the device made safe by the Irish army in the early hours of this morning.
"An army bomb disposal team made safe a viable improvised explosive device overnight in Maynooth, Co Kildare," an army spokesman said.
The Foreign Office has said the Queen will still go ahead with her planned four-day visit to Ireland.
The discovery of the bomb comes amid an unprecedented security operation in the country, costing an estimated 30 million euro (£26.2m). The operation includes land, air and sea patrols and a huge number of police deployed around the centre of the Irish capital.
The trip will be the first time a British monarch has set foot on Irish soil for 100 years, and is the first visit by a monarch since the country became a republic. King George V was the last to visit in 1911.
The Queen's itinerary will take in Croke Park, the home of Gaelic football where 14 people were slaughtered by British troops in 1920.
We'll have more on the bomb and live updates as the Queen arrives in Ireland.
8.37am: The Guardian's Ireland correspondent, has more on the bomb found in County Killdare this morning.
8.48am: A second device was found in a suburb of Dublin this morning, Gardai have confirmed to the Guardian, however the Irish army have declared it a hoax.
The device was found at 6am at the Black Horse tram stop in Inchicore, around two miles west of the centre of Dublin.
"The area was sealed off and the army EOD (bomb disposal team) were notified. The army EOD declared it a hoax, and the area was declared safe at approximately 8am this morning," a Gardai spokeswoman said.
She said the tram line is running again, and a road which was closed off has been reopened.
9.08am: The Queen is due to land at the Baldonnel military base, 10 miles south west of Dublin, at 12 noon. No firm timings have been given for the itinerary, but here's a list of where Elizabeth is going and what she'll do there, beginning with a chance to show off her green fingers:
• Ceremonial welcome • Meeting with President and Dr. McAleese • Tree Planting Ceremony
• View Book of Kells • Reception in the Long Room
9.15am: Henry McDonald has more on the political backdrop to the monarch's visit to Ireland.
10.09am: PA has some more information on the bomb that was found on a coach last night, and made safe this morning.
The device was a pipe bomb, and was discovered in a holdall in the luggage compartment of a "crowded bus", according to the agency. The bus, which was carrying 30 passengers and was on its way to Dublin, was stopped outside an hotel, apparently after a tip-off. Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion during a three hour operation.
The bus was operated by the state owned Bus Eireann company and had set off from Ballina, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland.
10.30am: On Twitter, #queensvisit is the most discussed topic in Ireland at the moment (it doesn't even breach the top ten in the UK, where tweeters are more concerned with #ignoredtextmessages).
11.15am: Henry McDonald is out and about, and nearly getting arrested, in central Dublin:
11.50am: Morrissey has marked her majesty's impending arrival in Ireland by writing about the monarchy for the music magazine Hot Press. The singer used the piece to describe the Queen's existence as "entirely against any notion of democracy", and by claiming there is little difference between the monarch and dictators like Muammar Gaddafi and Hosni Mubarak.
The full meaning of the Monarchy is, like the Queen herself, a complete mystery to most people. It is protected from any investigations by ridiculous stories of trivia and wedding dresses and on-again-off-again soap-drama romances. The most revealing statement came from Commander Christine Jones of the Metropolitan Police last month, when she warned that any British people carrying anti-royal placards who are "seen in the vicinity of the royal wedding would be removed under the Public Order Act." This means that any political dissent in England is silenced in order to protect the royals, which in itself goes against every principle of democracy. The very existence of the Queen and her now enormous family – all supported by the British taxpayer whether the British taxpayer likes it or not – is entirely against any notion of democracy, and is against freedom of speech. For a broad historical view of what the Queen is and how she "rules", examine Gaddafi or Mubarak, and see if you can spot any difference. The Queen also has the power to give back the six counties to the Irish people, allowing Ireland to be a nation once again. The fact that she has not done so is Fascism in full flow. What else could it be? Name one other European country that is controlled by its neighbour?
12.03pm: Below the line shimrod responds to DMCCUSKER12's inference that the Queen's visit is generally not welcome, claiming that the "vast majority of Irish citizens are either positive or mildly indifferent to the visit of the Head of State of the UK to the Republic".
12.10pm: The Queen's plane has landed at Baldonnel, by the way. A long red carpet gushes from the open aircraft door, with a black Range Rover at one end and soldiers lined either side.
And... she's out. The first reigning British monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland. Appropriately enough, the Queen is wearing green – hat and overcoat matching. She stops to collect a bouquet from a young girl, hops into the waiting car, and off they go.
Next stop Áras an Uachtaráin - the official residence of the President of Ireland – where she will meet President Mary McAleese.
12.32pm: Henry McDonald is out on the streets with dissident republicans who are protesting against the Queen's arrival:
12.37pm: It appears the Queen has been delayed slightly, so BBC and Sky are treating us to beautiful panning shots of Áras an Uachtaráin. It's a fine looking residence, it must be said.
12.46pm: She's here. Mary McAleese is waiting for the Queen, the Irish President resplendent in bright pink. Together they look like a couple of Refreshers.
12.51pm: We've just had a fly past, and now the Queen is inspecting the Guard of Honour. All seems to be well.
1.11pm: VincenzoScifoDieci writes that he's just passed through Dublin, and found it to be resembling a "coppers' convention".
1.17pm: The Queen has just planted a tree. Or rather she shovelled two very small piles of mud onto the base of a tree which looked suspiciously like it had already been planted. Fair enough though, she's not exactly dressed for gardening. The crowd applauds anyway.
Mary McAleese is now leading a tour across a portion of the gardens. I believe the pair will now depart for lunch.
1.24pm: A bit of lunchtime reading from my colleague Nick Watt, who writes on the Wintour and Watt blog that it was John Major who started the process which led to the Queen being received in Ireland today.
There was a pretty good interview with John Major on the Queen's visit on Newsnight last night (about 40 minutes in).
"It puts a seal on the past and builds for the future," he says.
"We've moved a great deal since the 1990s... we're huge trading partners, we have a huge Irish population here in the UK, quite a few Brits living in Ireland... there are 200 flights a day from London to Irish airports. It's become a very close relationship."
1.46pm: Stephen Bates is out on the road as part of the press pack on the Queen's four-day trip, and reports that the large media centre at Dublin Castle is filling up: "there is huge international interest".
As the Queen landed at the Baldonnel airfield, the headquarters of the Irish air force, the Irish media centre staff burst into spontaneous applause – though whether that was because of relief at the safe arrival, or that they had all won money on the bookies' bet that the Queen would wear green (that was a pretty odds-on bet) may be a moot point. Irish pundits on RTE are noting that the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly, though Liverpool-born is of Irish descent and so would have advised HM on what to wear (as if she needed it), and also that the Queen's dress is blue – St Patrick's colour – so a double whammy. Irish celebrities from north and south are gathering at Aras, the president's house and former British vice-regal lodge in Phoenix Park, ready for lunch: John Hume and David Trimble from the North. Mary McAleese, the president, likes to point out she sleeps in the bed at the Aras that was made for George V on his visit in 1911. Few Irish people have seen the Queen yet: Phoenix Park was cleared of members of the public, unlike when George V drove in an open carriage the eight miles from the port at Kingstown 100 years ago, waving to crowds all the way. The Manchester Guardian reported at the time that the wear on his hand was "only one of the minor penalties royalty has to pay for its popularity, but these courtesies must impose a very severe physical tax when they have to be measured by the mile." No danger of that today – but unlike quite often – the Queen is being very smiley today and looks genuinely pleased to be here.
1.59pm: @shoutinthewind @guardian @AdamGabbatt - Have the Irish got the money for this visit - It must be massively expensive and for what - A visit from the Queen!

2.17pm:Here we are – video of the Queen arriving in Ireland. She looks very pleased to be there.
2.45pm: The Queen is expected to leave Áras an Uachtaráin, and will travel to the Garden of Remembrance in central Dublin. Steve Bates is at the garden now, and reports that all is peaceful, "except for the helicopter overhead".
3.03pm: Adam Gabbatt has finished his royal duties for the day and has handed the baton to me, Mark Tran.
The Queen has come out from her lunch and is heading to the Garden of Remembrance to lay a wreath, the highlight of the visit. The cavalcade moves off led by a bevy of outriders. 150 demonstrators are waiting for her, Henry McDonald tells me over the phone. I can hear some shouting in the background over the line, but Henry says it's all peaceful. It's a lockdown and the protesters are about 300-500 yards from the garden, says Henry.
3.19pm: The streets are devoid of people as the Queen's Range Rover pulls up to the Garden of Remembrance. She and the Duke now make their way into the garden.
3.24pm: God Save the Queen is being played before she lays the wreath.
3.27pm: A soldier offers the Queen a large laurel wreath, which she places before a large black sculpture, representing the children of Lir, who were turned into swans. President Mary McAleese also lays a wreath and they stand heads bowed during a minute's silence, with the sound of a helicopter overhead. The Garden of Remembrance, which opened in 1966 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter uprising, honours all those who fought for Irish freedom from British rule.
3.32pm: A bit of oom-pah-pah music as the Queen and President McAleese remain in front of the wreaths.
3.35pm: The Queen and the president now make their exit, past the green reflecting pool. The symbolic act of reconciliation has gone off smoothly, albeit with some shouts from the protesters in the distance. The Queen is back in her car and heads off for her final engagement at Trinity college on the first day of her state visit. Only another three days to go.
3.39pm: Here's a bit of Press Association copy on the wreath-laying ceremony.
3.41pm: Pictures courtesy of the BBC show some pushing and shoving among demonstrators opposed to the Queen's presence.
3.50pm: The Queen was cheered by students and staff as she arrived in the grounds of Trinity College, where she views the Book of Kells, one of the earliest and most beautiful of illuminated gospels, from the 7th century. The Long Room of the library looks magnificent.
4.17pm: The Queen is doing much meeting and greeting in the Long Room, going down a long line. She's doing a good job of showing interest in the people she's chatting to, looking quite cheerful. They say customer-facing jobs are quite exhausting. Well she's meeting lots of complete strangers today and she's still smiling.
4.25pm: Close-ups of the Queen show her looking quite perky and engaged, not at all tired. Looks like she's enjoying the whole experience of being in the Long Room, checking out the artefacts and being introduced to yet more people.
4.31pm: Both the BBC and Sky News are carrying split screens of the Queen's visit and David Cameron appearing before the Commons liaison committee, taking questions on the economy. That's being being covered by Andrew Sparrow on his live blog.
4.34pm: The Queen is now meeting members of the public; many clap politely. Big smiles from those she stops to chat to. But not everyone is so welcoming and there have been protests in Dublin.
4.54pm: The visit to Trinity College is over and the royal caravan moves off, rounding off the last of the Queen's public engagements of the day. According to RTÉs political correspondent, David Davin-Power, gardaí are still involved in a standoff with few dozen protesters on Dorest St. But on the whole, the trip seems to have gone off very smoothly. The highlight was the solemn wreath-laying ceremony at the Remembrance Garden. The former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, described the ceremony as "historic and an important explicit expression of the relationship between two countries". We'll end this live blog here. Henry McDonald's story on the first day will be on the site shortly.
