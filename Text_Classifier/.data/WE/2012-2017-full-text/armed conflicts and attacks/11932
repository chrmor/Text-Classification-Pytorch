Three U.S. Contractors Said Killed in Kabul Airport Shooting
Three U.S. contractors were shot dead at North Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan, an American defense official said.
The lone shooter, who also was killed in the Jan. 29 incident, was an Afghan national, said the official, who asked not to be identified because details haven’t been announced.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and the official said it wasn’t clear whether any U.S. troops were in the airport area at the time of the attack.
