Academy-Award winning film composer James Horner dies in plane c - KSBY.com
The attorney for Academy Award-winning composer James Horner confirms Horner's plane crashed near Cuyama Monday morning. Horner was the pilot of the plane who died in the crash.
Horner is an Academy-Award winning composer, famous for his work in Titanic. It was that film that won him two Oscars, including "best original song" for "my heart will go on," performed by Celine Dion.
Michael Nowak, former music director and conductor of the San Luis Obispo Symphony worked with Horner on many films including, Troy, Avatar, Apollo 13, two Star Trek films and Jumanji.
"Whether it was Cocoon or Jumanji, or Project X, or Avatar, or Star Treks, it just had a certain sound to it. You would say 'oh, that's the Horner sound.' You could just tell. The rich orchestration, fantastic writing, high horn solos, and just very creative stuff," Nowak said.
Horner's attorney says he did not know where Horner was headed.
"Horner has five aircraft including two helicopters. He flies a lot and he's an experienced pilot," said Jay Cooper, Horner's attorney.
The FAA says only one person was on board the single-engine S312 Tucano MK1 that crashed for unknown reasons just before 9:30 a.m. in the Ventucopa area, two miles east of Highway 33 on Quatal Canyon Road in the Los Padres National Forest, just over the Santa Barbara County line in Ventura County.
Fire officials say, when rescue crews arrived, they found the debris field of a plane crash and approximately one acre of brush on fire. Firefighters were able to stop the spread of the flames and put the fire out.
The FAA and NTSB will investigate the crash. The NTSB is the lead investigative agency. It typically takes the NTSB months to come up with a probable cause for accidents.
