Uganda reports killing LRA commander Abudema in CAR
The Ugandan army says that it has killed a senior commander of the Lord's Resistance Army militant group in the Central African Republic (CAR).
Bok Abudema was killed on Friday along with one of his fighters, while two women found with them were freed, an army spokesman told the BBC.
The army said LRA leader Joseph Kony was moving between the CAR and Sudan.
Ugandan forces have been operating outside the country's borders for a year in a campaign to destroy the LRA.
They have been deployed in northern Democratic Republic Congo and southern Sudan as well as the CAR to track down the LRA, which once operated in northern Uganda.
Army spokesman Lt Col Felix Kulayigye said that Mr Kony was moving between the CAR, Darfur and southern Sudan in order to escape Ugandan army patrols.
Bok Abudema is only one of a number of senior LRA commanders who have been cornered and killed, says the BBC's Africa editor, Martin Plaut.
Others have surrendered but the LRA is scattered across a remote region of dense forests and swamps, savannah and deserts - ideal territory for guerrilla operations, our editor says.
Last month the UN human rights commissioner, Navi Pillay, demanded the capture of LRA leaders for crimes against humanity and gave details of the killings, torture and rape of hundreds of civilians by the rebels.
She accused the movement of killing at least 1,200 civilians between September 2008 and June 2009.
