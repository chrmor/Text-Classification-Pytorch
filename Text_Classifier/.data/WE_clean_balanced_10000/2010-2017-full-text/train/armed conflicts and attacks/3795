Kinshasa (AFP) - Fierce fighting between UN peacekeepers and Ugandan rebels raged in the restive east of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday, a day after a deadly attack by the rebel group.
UN General Jean Baillaud, acting commander of the UN's MONUSCO force, told AFP that the peacekeepers had tracked down the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and attacked them at dawn using combat helicopters.
