Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy punched during election walkabout
TV footage shows young man hitting prime minister on side of head but a party spokesperson said he was not hurt in the incident
The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has been punched in the face during a campaign event in his home region of Galicia for Sunday’s general election.
Rajoy, 60, was unhurt in the incident on Wednesday, a People’s party spokesman said, but he appeared later with a deep red mark on his face.
TV footage showed a young man punch Rajoy hard on the side of his head, knocking his glasses off, as he walked through the city of Pontevedra in the north-west of the country. The young man, a minor, was subsequently arrested, police confirmed separately.
The assailant had been standing next to Rajoy when he suddenly struck out, catching the prime minister by surprise. Rajoy continued with his campaign agenda unchanged after the incident.
The ruling People’s party is expected to win the election, even though it has presided over one of the worst economic slumps in decades. But it may fall short of the parliamentary majority it has enjoyed since 2011.
Spain has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the European Union, with almost half of those aged under 25 unable to find work.
