Bird flu strain detected in Whitley County
COLUMBIA CITY, Ind. (AP) â€“ Animal health officials say a strain of bird flu has been detected in a backyard poultry flock in northeastern Indiana.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N8 virus found in Whitley County is different from the H5N2 virus that has led to the loss of more than 30 million chickens, turkeys and other birds in 13 states including Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The USDA says some birds in the Whitley County flock of 77 ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys have died. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health says the remaining birds were removed from the site. It's also checking with nearby poultry owners to see if the disease has spread.
Bird flu poses little risk to humans and doesn't affect the safety of eating eggs or poultry.
