Seven tourists killed in rockfall at Guilin beauty spot
Seven tourists died on Thursday when they were struck by huge rocks tumbling down a mountain at one of China’s most popular beauty spots, state media said.
The rocks hit the group of travellers as they waited to board boats in the Diecai Mountain scenic area in Guilin, China Radio International reported.
Pictures posted online showed rocks, one as big as a metre wide, resting on broken pavement splattered with blood with handbags, shoes and other personal items scattered across the ground.
Four were killed at the scene and four others injured, the report said. Three of the injured later died in hospital.
The state-run news agency Xinhua said an unknown number of injured were getting treatment in a hospital in Guilin in the southern region of Guangxi.
Xinhua said the fatalities were the result of a huge boulder, while China Radio International and state broadcaster China Central Television said “rocks” fell down the mountain.
The state television network said on social media that 19 people were injured, with eight of the casualties from Taiwan.
The area is known for its karst mountains and caves and is a popular site for Chinese and foreign visitors, with Diecai Mountain, also known as Folded Brocade Hill, offering stunning views.
