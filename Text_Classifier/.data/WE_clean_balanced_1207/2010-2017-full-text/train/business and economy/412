News Limited lowers offer for ConsMedia
News Ltd has made a formal offer for James Packer's Consolidated Media, but it's lower than its original bid.
In a binding proposal made by News, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company has offered $3.45 for each ConsMedia share, less than the $3.50 it offered in an indicative bid in June.
ConsMedia owns a 50 per cent stake in Fox Sports and 25 per cent of Foxtel.
If the offer is successful, News will take control of Fox Sports and own half of Foxtel.
ConsMedia directors would unanimously recommend the offer to the company's shareholders, executive chairman James Packer said.
