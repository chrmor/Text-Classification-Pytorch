Islamic State terrorist murders police officer in Paris 
The child was rescued and was “shocked but unharmed,” Mr Brandet said.  Five detonations or shots were heard by millions on live television while Mr Brandet spoke to reporters as police stormed the home.
“Negotiations were opened but it became clear that they would not succeed and police then entered the home, where they found the body of a woman,” Mr Brandet said.
"The toll is a heavy one," Mr Brandet told reporters, his voice shaking with emotion. "This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual ... (and) we discovered the body of a woman. The assailant, the criminal was killed. Thankfully, a little boy was saved. He was in the house. He's safe and sound. He was saved by police officers."
Police sources said the attacker was a former soldier and a neighbour of the couple.
Witnesses heard the assailant, described as a teenager or in his early 20s, shout “Allahu Akhbar”, Arabic for "God is great".
Counter-terrorism prosecutors were placed in charge of the investigation, which had initially been treated as a criminal case.
A judicial source said the anti-terrorism unit of the prosecutor's office had been handed the investigation because of comments made during lengthy exchanges between the assailant and negotiators, but gave no further details.
The prosecutor in the Versailles area outside Paris said the little boy was receiving medical attention.
