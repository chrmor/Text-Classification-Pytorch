David Morris is Australia's flagbearer for closing ceremony
David Morris will carry the Australian flag at the closing ceremony - but what about his search for a girlfriend?
The 29-year-old Melbourne schoolteacher was bestowed with the honour after winning silver with a stunning display in the men's aerials earlier in the week.
Alex 'Chumpy' Pullin carried the flag in the opening ceremony, but after failing to win gold in the snowboard cross, Morris turned out to be the real Australian success story of these Winter Olympics.
"Chumpy got to take it in the opening ceremony, and he was a good representation of our team," Morris said. "To be selected to represent what we stand for is a real privilege. Gold would've been awesome, but silver will do. People tune into this sport every four years but they don't see the effort that goes in behind the scenes."
Asked if he had ever expected to be given the honour, he said: "Not a chance. A lot of people who followed me from the start thought it was possible, but not many other people did. This is the proof, and I will be waving it proudly. I watched Chumpy very carefully in the opening ceremony, so I will know what to do."
After claiming the silver medal, Morris was asked what was next on the agenda. He said finding a girlfriend was top of his to-do list.
