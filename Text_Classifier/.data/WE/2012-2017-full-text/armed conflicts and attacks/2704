'Main battle' about to begin in Aleppo, UN peacekeeping chief says
"The focus is now on Aleppo, where there has been a considerable buildup of military means, and where we have reason to believe that the main battle is about to start," said Herve Ladsous, the United Nations under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations.
Communication was spotty inside the besieged city. Cellular phone service was cut off, and power outages were reported in neighborhoods where there was heavy shelling, according to Deama, an activist there who asked that her full name not be used for her protection.
While diplomats debate how to handle the situation, there has been stepped-up help for the emboldened rebel forces, dominated by military defectors who have streamed into the opposition's arms for months.
Syrian state TV said soldiers "have been able to eliminate scores of terrorists and mercenaries" in Aleppo and claim to be sweeping through the city's Salaheddine neighborhood and towns west of Aleppo.
Shelling and clashes have raged across the city for days, prompting thousands to flee their homes. Both rebels and government forces are placing great importance on gaining control of the metropolis.
But Aleppo was not the only hot spot in Thursday's fighting. Anti-al-Assad fighters and government forces continued clashing across Syria. At least 130 people were killed throughout the country Thursday, including 50 in Damascus and its suburbs and seven in Aleppo province, the LCC said.
The opposition activist network blamed government troops for an attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus that killed 15 people. More than 50 others were wounded due to heavy shelling in the area, the LCC said.
In an online video purporting to show the camp after the shelling, men ran past charred, bloodied bodies on the street. In the background, a woman screamed. Another video purportedly showing the camp later Thursday night showed protesters chanting "the people want to bring down the regime."
The fighting has devastated the Syrian economy and left many people in dire straits. As many as 3 million Syrians will need food in the next 12 months as farmers in the conflict-ravaged nation lose assets and livestock, the United Nations said in a report Thursday.
"While the economic implications of these losses are quite grave, the humanitarian implications are far more pressing," said Muhannad Hadi, the World Food Programme representative in Syria.
On Wednesday, U.S. officials said President Barack Obama had signed a covert directive authorizing U.S. support for Syrian rebels. The secret order, referred to as an intelligence "finding," allows for clandestine support by the CIA and other agencies.
The Obama administration had said it would step up its assistance to the opposition after last month's failure by the U.N. Security Council to agree on tougher sanctions against the al-Assad regime, but exactly what type of support the finding authorizes was unclear. The Obama administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now, providing only nonlethal assistance, such as communications equipment.
