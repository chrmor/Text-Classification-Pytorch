Iran secure World Cup ticket
Iran became the first team from Asia to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ after a 2-0 victory over Uzbekistan on Monday evening.
Sardar Azmoun’s first-half goal set the Iranians on their way to victory at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, with Mehdi Taremi sealing qualification with a late second goal.
The result ensures Team Melli will be one of two teams to be heading to Russia 2018 from Group A of the third round of Asian zone qualifying. Carlos Queiroz’s side move on to 20 points at the top of the group after eight rounds of matches, eight points clear of third-place Uzbekistan, who are unable to catch the Iranians with their two remaining qualifiers in the group.
This is the fifth qualification to the global finals for Iran, having previously appeared at football’s showpiece event in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2014. They join hosts Russia and five-time World Cup winners Brazil in securing their spot for next June.
