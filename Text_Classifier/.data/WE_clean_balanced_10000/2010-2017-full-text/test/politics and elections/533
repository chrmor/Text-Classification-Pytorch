Ireland casts first votes on EU referendum
Irish voters on five remote islands off the counties of Donegal, Mayo and Galway were able to vote ahead of Thursday’s referendum, in case bad weather delayed the delivery of ballot boxes to Dublin.
The latest polls suggested Ireland would back the pact, designed to strengthen the euro through a stricter oversight of public finances. However, commentators noted that about a third of voters were still undecided.
Ireland’s prime minister, Enda Kenny, used a national televised address to call for a “strong” vote in favour of the treaty to “create the certainty and the stability” that the country needed for economic recovery. He warned that Ireland’s sovereign debt could be downgraded by rating agencies if the country rejects the EU pact.
“We have had a number of rating agencies already indicate that if the people were to turn down the fiscal stability treaty, that a downgrading of the country would follow,” he said.
Sinn Fein has criticised the pact, arguing that it would amount to the writing of “austerity into the constitution”. Any country which rejects the fiscal pact will not be eligible to access the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s permanent bail-out fund.
Ireland was forced to take an €85bn (£68bn) bail-out from the European Union and International Monetary Fund in 2010, and has won plaudits from eurozone members for its implementation of tough austerity measures.
Economists at Deutsche Bank said that a “yes” vote was not guaranteed. “Irish voters have some history of tactical 'no’ voting in European referendums. The Nice and Lisbon Treaties were rejected before certain issues were clarified,” they added.
Meanwhile, Ireland’s oldest stockbroker has been ordered to stop trading after alleged financial irregularities were discovered at the firm. Bloxham Stockbrokers confirmed on Monday that external and internal investigations have been launched into activities at the business.
