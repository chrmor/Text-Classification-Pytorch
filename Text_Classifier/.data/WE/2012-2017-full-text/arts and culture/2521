Hard Rock Calling 2012: 'Police state' pulls the plug on The Boss and The Beatle
It was, in the words of Bruce Springsteen’s guitarist, “one of the great gigs ever”.
But as 80,000 rapturous fans roared in delight in London’s Hyde Park, the American rock star known as “The Boss” was silenced by bureaucracy.
The move provoked bitter recriminations from fans and members of Springsteen’s E Street band, who claimed England had become a “police state”.
Despite waiting 50 years to sing alongside one of Britain’s most celebrated musicians, Sir Paul McCartney, the Springsteen concert was cut off after a council-imposed curfew was breached on Saturday night.
On Sunday night, authorities and the event’s organisers defended the decision to prematurely end the Hard Rock Calling music festival in order to comply with the event’s licence.
While admitting it was "unfortunate" the concert was stopped, officials insisted the curfew was in place to protect "public health and safety".
Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, also waded into the row on Sunday, criticising the “excessively efficacious [sic] decision”.
Following his “epic” three hour performance, belting out hits including Born In The USA and Because The Night, Springsteen, welcomed Sir Paul, 70, to the stage by saying: “I’ve waited about 50 years for this”.
Despite the headline concert already exceeding the curfew by eight minutes, the pair sang renditions of the Beatles hits “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Twist and Shout” under the driving rain and fireworks overhead.
But the musicians and their band were forced to leave the stage in silence after their sound equipment was switched off before they were able to thank their fans.
At first not realising their microphones had been cut, they stood for some minutes, bemused and bowing, before thanking fans in silence and walking off to loud jeers.
Springsteen also tried to sing "Goodnight Irene" but it was audible only to those near the stage.
The 62 year-old had earlier invited Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello on stage to perform two songs while singer John Fogerty also joined him for one.
The three-day event has a nightly noise curfew imposed at 10.30pm and Springsteen, renowned for his long sets, was due to play only from 7pm until 10.15pm.
The Daily Telegraph understands that a council official was situated in a “control room” on-site who had “reminded” the event’s organisers about the curfew. The plug was pulled at 10.38pm.
After the concert, Steven Van Zandt, 61, one of Springsteen’s guartarists, took to Twitter, the microblogging site, to air his frustration at the authorities’ reaction.
In a series of angry tweets, he wrote to his 37,000 followers: “One of the great gigs ever in my opinion. But seriously, when did England become a police state?
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Steven Van Zandt - One of the great gigs ever in my opinion. But seriously, when did England become a police state?&lt;/noframe&gt;
“We break curfews in every country. English cops may be the only individuals left on earth that wouldn't want to hear one more from Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Steven Van Zandt - We break curfews in every country but only English cops needs to "punish us" by not letting us leave until the entire crowd goes.&lt;/noframe&gt;
“I'm sorry but I have to be honest I'm p*****. Like I said, it didn't ruin the great night. But when I'm jamming with McCartney don't bug me!
He later added: “There's no grudges to be held. Just feel bad for our great fans. Hard Rock is cool. Live Nation is cool. It's some City Council stupid rule."

Audience members and fans also took to Twitter to vent their anger.
Simon Pegg, the comedian and actor, said: "Can't believe they pulled the plug on Springsteen and Macca last night in Hyde Park. What joyless, bitter killjoy made that decision? ‪#shame."

While Springsteen did not write about the curfew row himself on his official Twitter page, he "retweeted" several posts, including some from Van Zandt. In one tweet he described the concert as "epic". He did not comment further.

Mr Johnson said the musicians should have been allowed to continue their set. He said: “You won't get that during the Olympics. If they'd have called me, my answer would have been for them to jam in the name of the Lord."
While organisers cannot be fined, repeated breaches of the curfew could lead to a review of their licence, which was last completed in January
On Sunday night a spokesman for Live Nation, the event’s organisers, said: "It was unfortunate that the three hour plus performance by Bruce Springsteen was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public health and safety.”
Leith Penny, Westminster Council's strategic director for city management, said it was concert organisers, not the council, that ended the event.
He added: "Licences are granted until certain times to protect residents in the area from noise late at night."

Huge concerts in Hyde Park, a 350-acre parkland adjacent to some of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods, have increasingly caused friction between fans and residents.
As a result the number of concert, which can occur in Hyde Park will be reduced from 13 to nine from next year following complaints about noise. Spokesmen for Springsteen and Sir Paul were unavailable for comment.
Paul Simon closed out the event on Sunday night.
