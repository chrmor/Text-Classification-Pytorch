Pak to impose curfew in Karachi
ISLAMABAD: A partial curfew will be imposed in parts of Pakistan’s financial hub of Karachi to facilitate operations aimed at ending a surge in ethnic and political violence that has claimed nearly 30 lives, interior minister Rehman Malik said. Malik said a “semi-curfew ” would be imposed in parts of Karachi to facilitate operations against those involved in a spate of targeted killings. He was speaking to reporters at the Karachi airport after chairing a series of meetings to finalize a plan of action to end violence in the southern port city. Officials said security agencies would decide the duration of curfew to be imposed in parts of Karachi. Operations will be launched on the basis of intelligence reports and police and paramilitary forces have drawn up lists of persons wanted for targeted killings. Special teams have been formed to trace illegal arms caches and police commandos will be dropped in sensitive areas by helicopters for quick action against criminals, the officials said. Residents were asked to carry their ID cards at all times to ensure they do not face problems in areas where curfew is imposed. Malik chaired a meeting that was attended by Sindh chief minister Qaim Ali Shah and officials of the police department and security agencies to frame an action plan to end the violence.
