VIDEO: 2014 Japan Series ends on runner's interference call
The 2014 World Series ended on Wednesday night, then, on the other side of the world, the 2014 Japan Series ended Thursday morning. The Fukuoka Softbank Hawks beat the Hanshin Tigers in five games in the best-of-seven series to win the league title.
The final out of the Japan Series was recorded on a runner's intereference play at first base. With the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, former Twins infielder Tsuyoshi Nishioka hit a ground ball to first base. The first baseman threw home for the force out, and the catcher threw back to first for the 3-2-3 double play. The throw hit Nishioka though, and he was ruled to be out of the base line, hence the interference.
That's ex-big leaguer Dennis Sarfate on the mound for the Hawks, by the way. Just in case you were wondering what Dennis Sarfate is up to these days.
