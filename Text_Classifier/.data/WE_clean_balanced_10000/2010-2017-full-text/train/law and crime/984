Thailand to deport Aussie protester
An Australian man who pleaded guilty to breaching Thailand's emergency decree during anti-government protests in a Thai court will be deported to Australia.
Conor David Purcell, 30, from Western Australia, wearing the mandatory brown prison tunic and ankle chains, smiled broadly and appeared much relieved after judge Somchart Lertkhitworakul delivered his verdict.
The judge sentenced Purcell to "detention of three months", but reduced it to "one month and 15 days" in view of Purcell's guilty plea.
The "sentence has been fulfilled by the time you have spent based on the report of the court today", the judge said.
"It feels wonderful now that it's over," the Irish-born Purcell told AAP after the verdict. "It was done in as professional a manner as I could expect," he said.
Judge Somchart said that while Purcell was guilty of breaching the emergency decree laws imposed on April 7 and taking part in the protests, the Australian had not been associated with any violence.
