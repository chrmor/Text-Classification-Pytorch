$5,000 reward offered for arrest, conviction of park killer
Crime Stoppers has increased the reward to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the murderer of 16-year-old Sylvante Williams. 
Cops say Sylvante was among the four people shot at the Family Unity in the Park late last month at Luke Easter Park on the city's east side. He died at MetroHealth Medical Center.
Police are still searching for the shooters and the reward is growing. Police are offering $5,000 and another $5,000 was thrown in from a businessman.
According to Cleveland Police, the shootings happened after musical guest George Clinton wrapped up his set and the fireworks ended. Police say someone fired shots into a large crowd wounding three people and killing Williams.
Katrina Tucker was out celebrating her 55th birthday when the shots were fired. "I saw police running, but I thought it was crowd control," said Tucker.
One eyewitness, David, tells 19 Action News the shootings happened "right after the fireworks... that's when the action started...heard four shots. The police were here within two minutes, because they were already here."
Cleveland Police responded quickly to the shootings, there were already officers patrolling the annual event. When officers arrived to the scene near MLK and Reservoir Place, they located the four victims.
The victims include a Williams who was fatally shot in the head, a 20-year-old shot in the neck and a 14 and 23-year-old who were both shot in the leg.
All four shooting victims were transported to MetroHealth Medical Center.
Cleveland Police tell 19 Action News there are no suspects at this time, all they know is that the shooter was a black male.
