Cairo presidential palace targeted in Egypt clashes
Egyptian protesters have clashed with police outside the presidential palace in Cairo, after a week of violence in which more than 60 people were killed.
Riot police used tear gas and water cannon to try to drive back the crowds throwing rocks and petrol bombs.
The protesters accuse Islamist President Mohammed Morsi of betraying the 2011 uprising - a claim he denies.
