Barnett backs away from senior WA minister's secession call
Premier Colin Barnett has refused to support a call from one of his most senior ministers for Western Australia to consider seceding from the nation over the carbon tax and Minerals Resource Rent Tax.
Mines Minister Norman Moore yesterday spoke out about his long-held desire to see the state split from the rest of the nation, citing the two new taxes as opportune reasons to secede.
In an interview with Channel Ten's George Negus last night, Mr Moore - one of the WA government's most senior members and leader in the state's Upper House - said the federation was broken and needed to be fixed.
"We should try and fix up the Federation and in the event the Federation can't be fixed, and I suspect it can't be, then states like WA should give some thought to going it alone," Mr Moore said.
