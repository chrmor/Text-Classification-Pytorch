Deadly building collapse in Russia
The aftermath of a deadly building collapse in southern Russia. This nine-storey apartment block in the city of Astrakhan collapsed after a gas explosion. Six people have died, and another four are still missing. Hundreds of workers are combing through the rubble, desperately searching for survivors, and possibly bodies. The explosion apparently took place on a lower floor, causing the rest of the building to come crashing down. A local news agency reported that 26 people have been rescued, five of whom are being treated in hospital. Local authorities have opened a criminal investigation into what caused the blast.
