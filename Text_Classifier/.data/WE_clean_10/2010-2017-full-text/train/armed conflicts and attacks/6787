Opposition figures arrested in Bahrain 17/03/2011
ASHLEY HALL: Security forces have arrested several senior opposition figures in Bahrain as a crackdown on anti-government protests intensifies. It began early yesterday morning with a raid on Pearl Square in Bahrain's capital Manama which has housed the protesters base camp over the past month. Soldiers and riot police used tanks, tear gas, water cannon and helicopters to drive out thousands of protesters. The government says the only casualties in the raid were two policemen who were killed when they were repeatedly run over by cars containing fleeing protesters. But the protesters say six people have been confirmed dead, more than 200 are injured and eight people are on life support. In the last two hours it's become clear that the government crackdown is now targeting individual opposition figures as well. In a moment we'll hear from the wife of an opposition leader Ebrahim Sharif who was taken from his home in the dead of night. But first the son of another opposition figure who we'll call Hassan. He told me his family's home was being raided just as I spoke with him a little earlier. HASSAN: They just went to our home. They're calling me even now to tell me what's going on. I have no idea what's been� I mean all I know is my sister said that they're in our house and they're bashing in� ASHLEY HALL: And who's� HASSAN: And they're breaking things and� ASHLEY HALL: Who's is the house? HASSAN: It will be definitely the Saudi troops, occupiers. They're in my dad's house now as we speak. And I have no information to give you further than that. And then I called her and she - I think it was accidentally answered and I heard a bit of rough image. I mean it's very vague what's going on completely to me now. They're actually calling me as I'm speaking to you now and I'm still in a state of shock. I don't what's done to my dad or my mum or my sisters there. ASHLEY HALL: So tell me, why would they be targeting your family's house? HASSAN: Why would they target my dad? Because of the uprising which has happened. I mean my dad is still an opposition leader and they definitely will take it upon the people they think that are enforcing the ban, the people which they consider enemies, who are influencing the people to go out into the street and demand for their equal rights. ASHLEY HALL: Let's just backtrack about what's been a very, what's been a very busy day. There's been a lot going on today with government troops - security forces sweeping into Peal Square and driving hundreds of anti-government demonstrators from that camp there. A government statement says that the only fatalities during that raid were two policemen who were repeatedly run over by three vehicles containing protesters leaving the scene. Is that what you saw? Is that what you know? HASSAN: They came in with tanks, lots of jeeps. The whole army was there. They used live ammunitions. They used Apache helicopters on people. We have casualties which are unaccounted for completely 'til now. We have approximately six dead, confirmed dead. We have eight people who are living on life support now; they're brain dead. We have 200 severely injured people. They have paralysed the hospital and medical support in which they stopped a medical team from Kuwait enter Bahrain. They stopped main hospital from functioning. They stopped� ASHLEY HALL: How did - how did they do that? How did they stop the hospital from functioning? HASSAN: By surrounding it with tanks, not letting any of the doctors leave from the night shift from the previous shift. And they didn't allow any doctors to go in. ASHLEY HALL: So is it your assessment that the troops are containing, encircling the hospitals to prevent the doctors from taking a more active role? Or are they trying to prevent the protesters who have been injured from getting medical assistance? HASSAN: Both of them. ASHLEY HALL: Both. HASSAN: They don't want their crime to be put on the media. They don't want people to know what they did. The crimes have been I mean happening are absurd - people being shot at at the head. We have footage of it. Now as we speak, approximately two hours ago, they roundabout itself has been demolished. They took it off the ground. This is the extent of how much hatred they have inside themselves. To them that symbol is so effective they demolished it completely. ASHLEY HALL: That's Hassan, the son of an opposition leader in Bahrain whose family home was raided just as I was speaking to him. And after I spoke to Hassan we called Ebrahim Sharif and spoke to his wife Fereda who told me her husband Ebrahim had been taken from their home just minutes before. FEREDA SHARIF: About five minutes to two o'clock in the morning the doorbell rang. And when I looked from the window I saw about 40 men. All of them were putting a mask around their faces. ASHLEY HALL: Had you been asleep? FEREDA SHARIF: Yes. Yes well we were asleep and not asleep. So we were not exactly asleep. So they rang the doorbell and we came down very quickly. They said, you have to open the gate. We told them, why should we open the gate? Who are you? What do you want from us this time of night? It's not fair, 40 people of you coming here. They said, open the door, open the door, we will tell you, open the door. At that time one of them, a younger one maybe 25 years old or something, he climbed over the wall, he jumped into the garden. He had a gun. He pointed a gun toward Ebrahim. Ebrahim was very calm. He told him, you don't have to use the gun, please put the gun down, we will talk. At that time I came inside the house. I pushed the button and the gate was open so all of them came inside. ASHLEY HALL: You said that Ebrahim was quite calm during this. How were you? FEREDA SHARIF: Well when you see 40 people, they looked like they are here to beat, to beat you. For two minutes I was just thinking, I have to quickly wear my clothes and go down and be with Ebrahim because I don't want him to be alone. So� ASHLEY HALL: You weren't scared for your own safety though? FEREDA SHARIF: No because we were expecting this. We were expecting this, that they will come to the leaders of the opposition. And we have been getting threats, Ebrahim has been getting threats through SMSs. So we were certain that today and tomorrow something else, further actions and threats would happen. ASHLEY HALL: So take us back to two o'clock this morning. You said that the 40 men, you let them into your home. What happened next? FEREDA SHARIF: All of them entered the garden and dressed in completely black with the rifles, with helmets. One of the them, the spokesman, he was covering his mouth. He told Ebrahim you have to come with us. So Ebrahim handed me his telephone and his wallet. And I told them, I want to, I want to communicate with my husband, I need a number. One of them was laughing at me. He said, oh well you can come and see him at City Centre. You know City Centre is a shopping complex. I told him, you're making fun of me? City Centre? Where in City Centre? He said, oh second floor near the telephone. And he was making fun of me. He was not serious. ASHLEY HALL: So do you know where they have taken Ebrahim? FEREDA SHARIF: No we don't know. ASHLEY HALL: What do you believe will happen to Ebrahim now? FEREDA SHARIF: We don't know because usually they don't tell you where they put them, where they interrogate them. So I'll have to go back to our friends, the lawyers. Maybe they can help me and do something more tomorrow. ASHLEY HALL: Fereda Sharif, the wife of Ebrahim Sharif the leader of the Bahraini opposition group al-Waad.
