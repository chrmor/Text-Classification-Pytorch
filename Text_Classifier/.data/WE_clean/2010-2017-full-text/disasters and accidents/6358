Swiss mountaineer Erhard Loretan dies in climbing accident
Swiss mountain guide Erhard Loretan, one of the few climbers to ever reach the summits of all 14 of the world's peaks above 8,000m, has died in a climbing fall on his 52nd birthday.
Swiss police said on Friday that Loretan died leading a client up the summit ridge of the Gr√ºnhorn, in the Bernese Alps. The accident occurred at noon on Thursday.
The pair had skied up part way, then roped up for the final ascent. They fell 3,800m (12,500ft ) up the 4,043m(13,264-foot) peak. Loretan died at the scene, police from the Swiss canton of Valais said. His 38-year-old Swiss partner was flown to a hospital in serious condition. It is unclear exactly why they fell and police are investigating.
Loretan, originally from the canton of Fribourg, began climbing at the age of 11. He climbed his first 8,000m peak, Pakistan's difficult Nanga Parbat, in 1982. It took him 13 years to make it up the other 13 eight-thousanders.
Loretan's 1986 ascent of Mount Everest, without bottled oxygen and in a night-time push that took just 40 hours, stunned the climbing world and made headlines in climbing magazines and newspapers.
It also cemented his reputation as one of the world's top mountaineers after becoming the third person, behind Italian legend Reinhold Messner and Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka, to climb all the 8,000m peaks. Last year, Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban became the 25th, and only the second woman, to pull off that feat.
But Loretan's legendary exploits in the mountains were nearly overshadowed by the debate he prompted on baby-shaking in Switzerland after he pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter in the death of his seven-month-old son.
In 2003, he was given a four-month suspended sentence after shaking his son for a couple of seconds to stop him crying, he said.
