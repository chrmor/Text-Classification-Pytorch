China raises emergency response to deal with typhoons Nesat, Nalga
BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- China's flood control authority on Wednesday stepped up its emergency response to cope with two typhoons, Nesat and Nalgae, which may affect the country's coastal regions over the next few days. The authority has raised the emergency response to level III from the previous level IV, Chen Lei, deputy head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the minister of water resources, announced at a video working conference. The flood control authority requires local governments in relevant areas to closely monitor the typhoons and issue early warnings to the public in a timely manner. Local governments are also urged to remain on high alert for possible flooding and other disasters caused by the typhoons, and to organize evacuations if necessary. The flood control authority initiated a level IV typhoon response program on Monday and has sent two working teams to the provinces of Guangdong and Hainan, respectively, to assist with precautionary work.
