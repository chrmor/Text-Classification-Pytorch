Swiss police seize IT data from Fifa headquarters
Fifa has handed over computer data to the Swiss authorities investigating the World Cup bids for 2018 and 2022.
The information was seized at the Zurich headquarters of world football's governing body from offices which included that of its president Sepp Blatter, the BBC understands.
Fifa said it had co-operated fully with the authorities.
Swiss police said last month that they were looking into how the forthcoming World Cups were allocated.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is also carrying out an investigation into corruption at Fifa. So far 14 people have been indicted, nine of whom are current or former Fifa officials.
IT data from the offices of secretary general Jerome Valcke and the organisation's financial chief Markus Kattner is also believed to have been released to Swiss police.
Fifa reiterated that it had instigated the inquiry and the organisation was, according to the Swiss Attorney General, the "injured party".
