A Burning Man-Style Finale for a Giant Rabbit in Taiwan
For 11 days, the giant white rabbit peacefully lolled on the grassy roof of a hangar at a former air base in northern Taiwan. But after the Taoyuan Land Art Festival ended on Sunday, the 82-foot-tall work by the Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman met a calamitous end.
As the bunny was being disassembled on Monday, it accidentally caught fire. The rabbit’s head and legs were destroyed, leaving only a charred torso, an ear and an arm behind. The authorities said a spark from a hoist or from chain saws probably started the fire, according to the local news media. No injuries were reported.
Mr. Hofman’s works have been widely popular in Taiwan. The Taoyuan festival saw nearly 2.5 million visitors, and in 2013 his yellow “Rubber Duck” attracted huge crowds while on display in three Taiwanese cities. That installation also had technical problems. While in Taoyuan for the 2013 festival, the duck burst as it was being inflated.
The rabbit was officially titled “Moon Rabbit” after a creature from Chinese mythology, a companion of the moon goddess Chang’e. “Hofman’s ‘Moon Rabbit’ has burned,” said the Apple Daily newspaper of Taiwan. “It’s gone back to find Chang’e for a chat.”
