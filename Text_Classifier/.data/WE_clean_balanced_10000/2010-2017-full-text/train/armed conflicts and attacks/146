Report: Yemeni forces kill al Qaeda terrorist in capital
(CNN) -- Yemeni security forces have killed an al Qaeda terrorist wanted over a series of attacks in the country's capital, state media reported Friday.
Acting on intelligence reports, the security forces surrounded Shayef Mohammed Saeed Al-Shabwani in Sanaa, the capital, on Thursday night, the state-run news agency Saba said. It cited an official in Yemen's Supreme Security Committee.
Al-Shabwani, described by the Yemeni official as one of the "most-wanted dangerous" terrorists of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, then opened fire on the security personnel, the agency reported.
Al-Shabwani and another man who was with him at the time were killed in the ensuing clash, Saba said.
The Yemeni official told Saba that Al-Shabwani was responsible for planning and carrying out kidnappings and assassinations in Sanaa that targeted the military, the security forces and foreign citizens.
The report of his killing comes days after the the United States announced that it had suspended public services at its embassy in Sanaa, citing "recent attacks against Western interests in Yemen."
