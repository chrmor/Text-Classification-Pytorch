Rugby takes a back seat as Crusaders can Hurricanes clash
THE Crusaders have cancelled this weekend's Super 15 match as players deal with the tragedy of the Christchurch earthquake, and there are doubts about the city's capacity to host World Cup matches later this year.
NSW are scheduled to play the Crusaders there next week but that game will be moved from AMI Stadium, which was left waterlogged following the quake that has claimed at least 75 lives and left hundreds missing.
The Crusaders will today decide whether to possibly to shift the game to Sydney, or play it somewhere else in New Zealand.
Crusaders players and staff held a sombre meeting last night, during which it was decided to scrap the round two clash against the Hurricanes in Wellington, a fully understandable move given the mass human toll, including one of their own in director Philip McDonald. The players want to remain with their families this weekend.
SANZAR last night announced the match would be declared a draw with the teams would share the points.
Photos emerged of a flooded AMI Stadium last night, and officials will today reveal the extent of the damage to the newly built venue, but it is highly unlikely the field will be fit to host games any time soon, and the Crusaders might need to find a new home ground.
