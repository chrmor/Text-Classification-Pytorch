Thousands march in Burkina against president's re-election bid
There have been continuing protests in Burkina Faso against President Blaise Compaore’s plan to seek re-election for a fifth term.
Thousands marched through the capital, Ouagadougou, for a second day on Wednesday to denounce proposed constitutional reform.
Augustin Blaise Hien, General Secretary of the National Councill of Workers described the powers of the president as entrenched like the force of the military: “We must continue to fight for freedom,” he added.
The political crisis spilled onto the streets on Tuesday in a campaign of civil disobedience called by the opposition.
The National Assembly is due to debate the issue today and some critics of the president’s plan are trying to prevent a vote from being held.
Last weekend the government secured the support of a major party that would, on paper, allow the changes to happen.
