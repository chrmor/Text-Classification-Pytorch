Air Force jets strike Hamas targets in response to rocket fire
The Air Force struck a Hamas maritime police base in northern Gaza, and an armed wing base in the strip's center in reaction to the rocket fire, no casualties were reported.
Red Alert sirens sounded in southern Israel on Sunday evening, sending residents of Gaza adjacent communities fleeing into their bunkers.
A rocket fire from Gaza landed in an open area within the Shaar HaNegev regional council.
The last rocket fire out of the Gaza Strip fell in an open area with the Eshkol regional council on November 23rd. The Air Force struck several targets inside the strip in response to the fire. Palestinian sources reported that the military struck a Hamas military wing position in the Gaza strip's center. 
On Novemeber 17 a  false alarm caused the Iron Dome missile-defense system to fire an interceptor missile, but no rocket was fired from Gaza at Israel.
The Code Red rocket-alert siren went off at the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council due to gunfire inside the Gaza Strip.
The Iron Dome system has become highly sensitive following upgrades it recently underwent, which resulted in the Ashkelon battery firing a missile that had to explode midair when it became apparent it had no target to hit.
