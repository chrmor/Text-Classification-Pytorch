Thomas Bach elected president of IOC
BUENOS AIRES: Thomas Bach fulfilled a long-held dream on Tuesday as he was elected to the most powerful position in sport, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), in Buenos Aires.
The 59-year-old German -- the first Olympic gold medallist to become president -- won in the second round of voting by his fellow IOC members to beat five male rivals bidding to succeed Jacques Rogge, who stepped down after 12 years in charge.
Bach polled 49 votes in the second round to achieve the majority, with only Puerto Rican banker Richard Carrion getting into double figures with a respectable 29.
Athletics legend Sergey Bubka was humiliated as he garnered just four votes -- although he made the second round, which was not the case for Taiwan's Wu Ching-Kuo, who was eliminated.
