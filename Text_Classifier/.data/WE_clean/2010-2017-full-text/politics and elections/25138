Nevada Republican Caucus results, analysis: Donald Trump triumphant, ready for Super Tuesday
The Nevada Republican caucuses took place Tuesday, February 23. This post provides hour-by-hour news, exit polls, results and analysis.
Update (February 24, 7:05 a.m.): Welcome to the new Republican Party
The Republican Party as you've always known it is gone. A new entity has risen to take its place, one that neither party officials nor pundits understand.
"Suddenly, there are three strands of Republicanism, each entrenched and vying for supremacy in 2016," Politico wrote after Tuesday's Nevada Caucus. "Ted Cruz is the leader of the traditional conservative purists. Marco Rubio is emerging from the mud of a multi-candidate brawl to lead the once-dominant, now diminished, mainstream lane of the GOP. But it is Donald Trump's new alliance of angry populists that is ascendant -- and on the precipice of dominance."
All true enough, though the part about Rubio is a little misleading. So-called "traditional" Republicans like former presidential nominee Bob Dole are lining up behind Rubio, but it's not because he's one of them. He's simply not Trump or Cruz. Keep in mind that Rubio was a Tea Party favorite when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. His agenda is extreme compared to the one that Dole ran on in 1996.
So we're in a whole new world in this election. Is the Republican Party becoming a fringe party -- or has the country truly changed so dramatically that Trump now represents mainstream American political thought? Time will tell.
Businessman and reality-TV star Donald Trump has won the Nevada Republican Caucus, news sources project. After placing second to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Iowa Caucus on Feb. 1, Trump has now won three straight elections by wide margins: the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and the Nevada Caucus.
Trump now heads to the March 1 multiple-state Super Tuesday contest with powerful momentum. If he wins a majority of the states next week, it will become very difficult for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Gov. Ted Cruz or anyone else to stop his march to the Republican presidential nomination.
Last June, when Trump announced he was running for president, his candidacy was widely considered a joke, nothing more than a shameless play for attention. Reports circulated that he had to pay people to show up and cheer at his announcement event, and NBC figured Trump would be out of the race and back on the network's prime-time schedule by the fall. "We will re-evaluate Trump's role as host of 'Celebrity Apprentice' should it become necessary, as we are committed to this franchise," NBC declared.
Eight months later, Trump is not just the front-runner for the Republican nomination, he is beginning to look unbeatable. He has been replaced on "Celebrity Apprentice" by action-movie star and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Which of these four candidate qualities mattered the most in deciding whom to support today?
Tells it like it is: 21 percent
That's right, a candidate who could win the general election mattered the most to only one in four Nevada Republican caucus-goers.
Here are some entrance/exit poll numbers from Nevada caucus sites:
61 percent of Nevada Republican caucus-goers want the presidential nominee to "be an outsider."
33 percent want the nominee to "have experience" in Washington politics.
About 60 percent says they're "angry at the way the federal government is working."
This all falls in line with the entrance/exit polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina that indicated voters want someone who will explode the Washington status quo. The polls are, needless to say, a very good sign for Donald Trump.
The entrance polls also show that 24 percent of caucus-goers chose a candidate in the "last few days."
Nevada Republicans are split four ways on what they consider the most important issue facing the country. Immigration, terrorism, the economy and government spending all landed in the 20 percent to 30 percent range.
Have you been wondering how real-estate mogul Donald Trump became a star among Republican Party voters? Then you must not watch "Fox & Friends."
On Monday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich blamed -- and considering the tenor of the conversation, that seems like the right word -- the Fox News program for creating the Trump political phenomenon. Trump appeared on the show every Monday for four years, until he launched his presidential campaign last spring. The regular segment was called, simply, "Mondays with Trump."
"Look, you could say that Trump is the candidate 'Fox & Friends' invented," Gingrich said on the show, reports Daily Beast. "He was on your show I think more than any other show. It was always a happy, positive conversation."
"If Trump is blowing through March, then the panic really sets in, and then it's all about simply denying him a majority of delegates, doing whatever it takes," MSNBC political analyst Chuck Todd said Tuesday, according to Real Clear Politics. "There is still a filing deadline to make the California primary. Maybe a Mitt Romney. This is a scenario someone outlined to me a couple days ago. Mitt Romney would file late, you may get favorite sons and daughters to file late, simply to try to beat Trump, deny him delegates and create another way for a brokered convention. I have to tell you, it's most far-fetched."
That is indeed most far-fetched. But it does suggest that so-called "establishment" Republicans -- and few politicians represent the GOP establishment more than Romney -- really are panicking over Trump. It's not necessarily because they think the real-estate mogul would do a poor job as president. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman had some nice things to say about Trump this week. It's because they're realists. And they still don't believe that a boastful, pro-torture, pro-mass deportation New Yorker can win over independents and disaffected Democrats in a general election. Polling in South Carolina last week found that 38 percent of Trump voters "wish the South had won the Civil War." These are the kind of numbers you expect a third-party crank to get, not the nominee of one of the two major political parties in the country.
So what will stop Trump? Clearly, it's not his controversial policy proposals such as the "beautiful wall" he plans to build along the southern border. The more far out his ideas, the more they're embraced by Republican voters who are fed up with the status quo. So maybe -- like Karl Rove attacking John Kerry's war record in 2004 -- the anti-Trump faction will try attacking the real-estate mogul's strength: his record as a businessman.
So far Trump hasn't really been vetted, but that is now starting to happen. The Economist looked at his business career in its latest issue. It concluded that, yes, he's made good money in real estate (as well as impressively turning himself into a reality-TV star), but "Mr. Trump's [organization's] performance has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York." The conservative British magazine concludes:
"He has great wealth, much of it made well over a decade ago from a few buildings he has retained in Manhattan, including his favorite on Fifth Avenue. But he has not yet created a great company, raised permanent capital on public markets, gone global or diversified very successfully. Something to think about when you are sipping an $18 'You're Fired' Bloody Mary at the Trump Tower -- or voting in a presidential election."
You can expect Trump's remaining rivals in the GOP presidential contest to pick up on this line of attack.
Old-school Republicans like 1996 GOP presidential nominee Robert Dole are lining up to support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman insists that "one shouldn't treat establishment support as an indication that Mr. Rubio is moderate and sensible. On the contrary, not long ago someone holding his policy views would have been considered a fringe crank."
Krugman writes that Rubio's proposed tax cuts and balanced-budget-amendment plan are contradictory and would be "catastrophic" in a recession. And that's just for starters.
Rubio, it should be remembered, was a Tea Party favorite when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. But 2010's Republican radical is today's reasonable alternative. That is, when the front-runner for the GOP nomination is businessman Donald Trump, who has channeled outsider outrage at Washington business-as-usual and been rewarded for it.
Trump has little on-the-ground organization in Nevada but is expected to win the state's caucuses tonight. Rubio, who has yet to win a primary or caucus, must score a strong second place to maintain the narrative that he's the logical choice for so-called "establishment" Republicans.
Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is a Republican and easily the most popular politician in his state. But none of the GOP presidential candidates have been eager to be seen with him in the run-up to Tuesday's caucuses.
Politico points out the problem: Last year, he signed a tax increase into law. It doesn't matter than it was for education, an issue that's important to people of every ideological persuasion. He OK'd a tax increase, and ever since President George H.W. Bush went back on his "Read my lips, no new taxes" pledge more than two decades ago, that's just not OK for a Republican.
That said, Sandoval might just need to be patient. "When the general election comes, Sandoval's endorsement will be desperately needed," Politico writes. "Democrats privately fear he could be a potent weapon to drive Latino and Hispanic turnout. But in an unpredictable and highly partisan GOP caucus, with many conservative Republicans alleging betrayal by Sandoval over his historic tax hike and threatening revolt, the endorsement of the Nevada governor is seen as more of a headache than a helpmate. And no one is quite sure what to do about him."
The easy answer for Republican presidential candidates: ignore him. But at least one of them probably will be singing a different tune in a few months.
Update (February 23, 4 p.m. PT): Bring on the best and brightest
Jon Hunstman, the former Republican Utah governor who served as ambassador to China under President Obama, was considered too moderate ideologically and too mild-mannered temperamentally to be taken seriously by primary voters when he ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012.
But Huntsman says he'd have no trouble backing Donald Trump if the bombastic, controversy-sparking real-estate mogul wins the 2016 Republican nomination. Huntsman said on David Axelrod's podcast that Trump is "right about bringing aboard a new generation of the best and the brightest and wiping out the old Washington establishment and the old Washington culture."
Update (February 23, 1 p.m. PT): How do you solve a problem like The Donald?
"Stopping Donald J. Trump is imperative -- and not just for his fellow Republicans."
So says the Boston Globe editorial board. And why is it imperative?
"Trump's campaign has revived some of the ugliest traditions in American politics, including the scapegoating of religious minorities and immigrants," the editorial states. "He has yet to put forth a serious platform of ideas about how he would govern or what a Trump administration would seek to accomplish. Just his nomination by one of the nation's major parties would be an international embarrassment."
The Globe has endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the Republican presidential nomination. Over the past few days, many Republican insiders who want to stop Trump have begun urging Kasich to get out of the race so that so-called "mainstream" GOP voters can move en masse to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who finished second in Saturday's South Carolina primary.
It's probably too late to stop Trump in Nevada. Wrote CNN Tuesday: "The more traditional campaigns of [Ted] Cruz and Rubio, said longtime Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston, 'are very frustrated by what everyone's frustrated by: you can't talk any sense into the Trump voters, they can't turn them.'"
The Nevada caucuses take place this evening. Massachusetts votes on March 1 as part of Super Tuesday.
Nevada Republicans head out to caucus Tuesday night, three days after Democrats in the state gave a narrow victory to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Real-estate magnate Donald Trump, who won the New Hampshire and South Carolina Republican primaries by wide margins, is expected to triumph in the caucuses. But polling has not been robust in the Silver State and is not considered especially reliable, in part because Nevada is still new to caucuses.
Nevertheless, those making guesses are pretty confident. "Nevada has always been perfect for Trump," a Republican insider told Politico. "He is a flashy billionaire with ties to gaming. That might have slowed him down in Iowa, but in Nevada it will be embraced and celebrated."
Plus, Trump's rivals seem increasingly desperate. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz put out a TV ad in Nevada in which he says he'll work "day and night" to strip public land in the state away from the federal government and give it to Nevada's "citizens." This appeal synchs with backers of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who led an armed standoff against the federal government in 2014 and is now in custody in Portland, Oregon.
Cruz has also become sensitive to charges from Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and others that he's running a dirty campaign. The latest questionable episode -- the promotion of a video that falsely claims to show Rubio disparaging the Bible -- led to Cruz firing his chief spokesman.
"I have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity," he told reporters in Las Vegas.
Rubio, meanwhile, is the new hope of mainstream Republicans. His come-from-behind second-place finish in South Carolina was impressive and surprising, but he still hasn't won a contest. He needs to do so soon or Trump will take on the invincibility cloak.
"The window is closing, and we need to move now," a Republican donor backing Rubio told The Washington Post.
Many Republican insiders, fearful of having Trump as their presidential nominee, are encouraging Ohio Gov. John Kasich to follow former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush out of the race to allow traditional Republican voters to fully embrace Rubio. In this scenario, Trump, Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson would split the vote of Republicans who are angry with the party establishment while Rubio took the rest.
For now, Kasich is still in the race, but Rubio is already starting to turn up the heat on Trump and the other party insurgents. A new pro-Rubio TV ad shows Trump childishly mocking a reporter's physical disability and calls Cruz "calculated and underhanded." It refers to Rubio as "a disciple of Reagan" and "the Democrats' nightmare."
But the ad isn't going up in Nevada. It's targeting the March 1 Super Tuesday states.
