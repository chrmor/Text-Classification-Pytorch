Speaking at a lunch in Washington DC ahead of his inauguration, Mr Trump introduced a guest as "sitting next to the ambassador Woody Johnson, going to Saint James".
The UK's ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch was among the first to welcome the appointment, tweeting: "Congratulations @WoodyJohnson4 on nomination as US Ambassador to the UK! Surely you can replicate the success of @NYJets in London 2015."
Although not yet formally announced, Mr Johnson, a Republican donor, had been seen as a frontrunner for the plum role.
The philanthropist and heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical empire has known Mr Trump for years, but originally supported his rival Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries.
However, after Mr Bush crashed out of the race, Mr Johnson threw his support behind Mr Trump and acted as both an adviser and fundraiser during the election campaign.
The ambassadorial appointment will need to be approved by the US Senate.
