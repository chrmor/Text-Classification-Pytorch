Trade Deficit Widens 8.5% Despite Growth in Exports
WASHINGTON â€” The trade deficit widened in April, as demand for foreign cars, cellphones and other imported goods outpaced growth in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the trade gap rose 8.5 percent in April from March, to $40.3 billion.
Exports increased 1.2 percent to $187.4 billion, the second-highest level on record. Companies sold more telecommunications equipment, industrial machinery and airplane parts, while vehicles made in the United States and auto parts also rose to a high of $12.8 billion.
But imports grew an even faster 2.4 percent, to $227.7 billion. Sales of foreign cars increased to $25.5 billion. Americans also bought more consumer goods, led by a big gain in foreign-made cellphones.
A wider trade gap can restrain growth because it means American consumers and businesses are spending more on foreign goods than United States companies are gaining in overseas sales.
