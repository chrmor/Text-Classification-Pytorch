Thousands of refugees cross back into Syria from Turkey: security sources
More than 2,000 Syrian refugees who had fled into Turkey crossed back Monday, security sources and witnesses said, as a gate reopened a few days after ISIS militants were ousted from the frontier town of Tal Abyad by Syrian Kurds. More than 23,000 refugees fleeing fighting in northern Syria entered Turkey earlier this month, according to Turkish authorities cited by the U.N. refugee agency. Syria's civil war has turned more than 3 million people into refugees -- almost a fifth of the pre-war population.
