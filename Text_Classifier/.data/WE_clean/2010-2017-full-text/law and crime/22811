Diaz is suspected of first shooting a male driver to death in a car and causing minor injuries to a passenger, police said. Seven minutes later, police responded to a call that someone shot at a woman in another car, causing her minor injuries from broken glass.
Ten minutes later, a man was assaulted with fists and an unknown blunt instrument as he sat inside his parked vehicle, police said.
Twenty minutes later, police responded to a report that a car had crashed into a building wall. A man found dead inside had suffered gunshot wounds, police said.
A few minutes later, in nearby Beaumont, California, police were alerted that a man was knocking on residence doors and they then learned that a man was breaking a window and a door handle of an occupied vehicle, police said.
Beaumont police officers stopped a vehicle matching the description of the vehicle of the suspect in the shootings and other offenses. He was taken into custody and a weapon was found inside the vehicle, police said.
Diaz was booked into jail and in addition to murder he is charged with assault with a deadly weapon on a person, shooting at a person from a vehicle, shooting at an inhabited vehicle and attempted murder, police said.
Banning is a community of about 30,000 people about 80 miles east of Los Angeles.
