New rooftop protest at Villawood as hunger strikers treated
Nine people, including a pregnant woman, have climbed on to the roof of a building at Sydney's Villawood detention centre, just 13 hours after 11 other detainees ended their 30-hour protest on another roof.
The Chinese nationals, four of whom are women, climbed on to the roofs of one of the centre's buildings about 8am today, an Immigration Department spokesman said.
Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition said the Chinese nationals were held in the same area as Fijian detainee Josefa Rauluni, 36, who fell to his death on Monday.
The Heraldunderstands today's protest is because the detainees believe their visa applications are taking too long to process.
The group want their applications looked at before they come down, although they have not set a deadline for their demand to be met.
