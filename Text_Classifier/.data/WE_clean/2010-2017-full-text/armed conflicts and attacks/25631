Taliban fires explosives at Afghan parliament compound
Taliban fighters have fired explosives at Afghanistan's parliament compound in Kabul as the country's top intelligence official and caretaker minister of interior were due to speak, politicians and the Taliban said.
Members of Parliament said no one was wounded in Monday's attack in the capital.
"Three rockets were fired at the parliament but they did not hit the main building," said Safiullah Muslim, a politician from Badakhshan province.
"It happened when the session was ongoing."
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack and said it caused heavy casualties.
There were also conflicting reports as to whether the explosions were caused by long-range rocket artillery or shoulder-fired rocket-propelled grenades.
