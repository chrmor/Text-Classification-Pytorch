9 killed in western Colombia traffic accident
At least nine people were killed and at least 10 others were reported wounded Monday after a bus falls of a 300-meter cliff in western Colombia.
The bus crashed in the department of Tolima while en route to the city of Medellin.
The vehicle fell about 300 meters off the rural road which, due to Colombia’s mountainous terrain, can often be precarious and sometimes dangerous to maneuver.
Colonel Javier Herrera, the department’s police chief, was quoted as saying “The bottom line of this tragic event is 9 people dead and another 10 are injured,” going on to claim that “The cause is bad weather, fog, rain also, the bus tried to avoid a rock that had fallen on the road.”
Initially five people were reported dead. However, four more died on the way to the areas hospital, reported Colombian newspaper El Tiempo.
