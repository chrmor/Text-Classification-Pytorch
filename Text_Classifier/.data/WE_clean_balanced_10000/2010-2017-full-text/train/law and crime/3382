Adams receives death threat
A Sinn Féin spokesperson has said party President Gerry Adams has received a death threat from a loyalist paramilitary group called the Orange Volunteers.
The threat was received by the PSNI who then informed Mr Adams.
Similar threats, from the same organisation, were made against two other senior Sinn Féin members Gerry Kelly and Caitríona Ruane earlier this week.
