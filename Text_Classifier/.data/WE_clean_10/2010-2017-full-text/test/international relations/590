Pakistan officials summon British high commissioner
Envoy called in by foreign ministry as row over David Cameron's comments on terrorism overshadows Zardari visit
The Pakistani government has summoned Britain's high commissioner to Islamabad amid a diplomatic storm over David Cameron's comments about Pakistani attitudes to terrorism.
Adam Thomson was called in by the Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, in what was seen as a dressing down after the prime minister infuriated Pakistan with his remarks while visiting India.
"The foreign minister emphasised that terrorism was a global issue and had to be dealt with by all countries in a spirit of co-operation, rather than putting the entire onus on any one country," the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
"He said Pakistan was itself a victim of terrorism and its efforts against violent extremism could not be negated."
As the row threatened to overshadow an official visit to the UK by Pakistan's president, Asif Zardari, Downing Street said the prime minister would not back down.
"He stands by the comments he made," a spokeswoman said. She insisted the UK had "very good, strong relations" with Pakistan, and played down the burning of an effigy of Cameron in Karachi.
"Clearly people have a right to protest," she added.
Opposition parties in Pakistan have demanded that Zardari cancel his trip, a suggestion he has rejected. Pakistan's powerful military establishment has already demonstrated its anger by cancelling a visit by a delegation of intelligence officials to the UK.
Zardari – who arrives in Britain tomorrow – will "forcefully take up" the remarks when he meets Cameron, according to Pakistan's information minister, Qamar Zaman Kaira. Attention is most likely to be focused on a session with the prime minister at Chequers on Friday.
Cameron started the furore last week when he said Pakistan could no longer "look both ways" by tolerating terrorism while demanding respect as a democracy.
Pakistan's military was particularly incensed that Cameron chose to make his comments in India, Pakistan's traditional rival. Amid fears that security co-operation between Britain and Pakistan could be hit by the row, British officials have sought to play down the significance of the spat, insisting "no long-term damage" had been done by the prime minister's remarks.
British counter-terrorist officials make no secret of the importance they attach to security co-operation with Pakistan, although they admit the relationship can sometimes be difficult.
Gordon Brown said 75% of terrorist plots in the UK had links to Pakistan, though that figure is now said to be down to around 50% as al-Qaida's presence and operational abilities in the region have diminished.
Britain's high commission in Islamabad has long included a senior representative from MI6 and also, more recently, from MI5 – a change that reflects the growth of domestic UK security concerns since the July 2005 London bombings.
The shadow foreign secretary, David Miliband, compared Cameron's diplomatic style to "a cuttlefish squirting out ink".
"Mr Cameron has used the last two weeks to make a verbal splash on foreign policy. Like a cuttlefish squirting out ink his words were copious and created a mess," Miliband said.
"The mindsets in Israel, Pakistan and Britain have all been given the once-over. But making a splash is not the same as making a difference. That is the real test, not the false trail of whether to speak straight or not."
Miliband said Cameron should have acknowledged Pakistan's suffering at the hands of terrorists and its democratic progress in recent years, rather than highlighting allegations of covert support for the Taliban in Afghanistan that received fresh impetus last week.
Cameron angered Israel by describing the Palestinian enclave of Gaza as "a prison camp" during a visit to Turkey last week.
