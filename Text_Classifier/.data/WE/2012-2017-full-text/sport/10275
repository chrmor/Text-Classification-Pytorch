Brazil 0-3 Holland FIFA World Cup 2014 MATCH REPORT: Robin van Persie and co pile on misery for hosts
Hosts Brazil were denied the chance to restore pride and claim third place as an early double from Robin van Persie and Daley Blind secured victory in Saturday's play-off.
Manchester United striker Van Persie put Holland ahead in only the third minute from the penalty spot after Thiago Silva pulled down Arjen Robben.
Replays showed the foul that led to the penalty took place outside the box. Silva surprisingly received only a caution even though he was the last man.
Holland doubled their lead when David Luiz, who performed poorly in Brazil's 7-1 semi-final defeat to Germany, headed the ball straight to Daley Blind and he lashed the ball past Julio Cesar in the 16th minute.
Wijnaldum sealed victory with third goal in injury time.
