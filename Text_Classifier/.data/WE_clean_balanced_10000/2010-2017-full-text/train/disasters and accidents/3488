This is the terrifying moment a civilian cargo plane in Afghanistan spun out of control and crashed, killing everyone on board, writes Claire Cromie
The Boeing 747 had just taken off on Monday when it plummeted to the ground, hitting Bagram airbase.
All seven American crew members on board died. The jet was on its way to Dubai.
The video footage was captured on what appears to be the dashboard camera of a vehicle that was driving near the site when the incident happened.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for "shooting down" the jet - owned by National Airlines, a Florida-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo - but a Nato spokesman later denied the Taliban was involved.
The aircraft had reached an altitude of 1,300ft before "falling out of the sky", according to witness reports.
An Aviation Safety Network incident report said: "The aeroplane attained a very steep nose-up attitude immediately after takeoff from runway 03.
"It rolled left and right and entered a stall, descending towards the ground until it struck the ground near the end of the runway." The report states a thunderstorm was approaching the airbase at the time of the accident.
