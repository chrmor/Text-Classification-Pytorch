BREAKING: South Africa Judge rejects bid to appeal Pistorius' six-year murder sentence
A South African court has rejected a bid by the state prosecutor to appeal Oscar Pistorius' six-year prison sentence for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. 
The prosecution had argued the decision was too lenient, but Judge Thokozile Masipa said the petition to appeal had no reasonable prospects of success.
