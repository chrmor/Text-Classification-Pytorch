A ‘game-changer in the search for aliens’: China switches on world’s biggest telescope
The telescope not only dwarfs the next biggest dish, the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, which is 300m wide, but it is also 10 times more sensitive, according to Zheng Xiaonian, deputy director of China’s National Astronomical Observatories, which is behind the construction of FAST.
The 1.2 billion yuan (£140 million) telescope seeks to unlock answers on the evolution of the universe through studying the distribution of neutral hydrogen, and it will also compile huge amounts of data on physical phenomena in space, such as pulsars and black holes.
But it’s the ability of the gargantuan dish to hunt extra terrestrial life which has got scientists excited.
“Past efforts have been described as someone walking to the edge of the ocean, dipping in a glass and concluding there are no fish in the ocean if none were found in the glass,” said Jane Johnson, professor of national security affairs at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.
But now “a more thorough search is possible,” the expert on the Chinese space program added.
