Alcaraz back at Granada to replace Anquela
Relegation-threatened Granada CF have parted company with coach Juan Antonio Anquela and appointed Lucas Alcaraz, until yesterday in charge of Aris Thessaloniki FC, to take over for the rest of the season.
The Andalusian club's decision follows Monday's 3-0 defeat at Sevilla FC which left Granada fourth from bottom in the Spanish Liga, with only five wins from 21 games this season. Anquela, 55, had been at the helm since last June, after the former Real Jaén CF coach caught the eye leading AD Alcorcón to last season's promotion play-offs to the top flight.
His successor at Los Cármenes, the 46-year-old Alcaraz, coached Granada in Spain's third tier of football between 1995 and 1998 before going on to jobs with UD Almería, RC Recreativo de Huelva – whom he guided to promotion and a Spanish Cup final appearance – Real Racing Club, Real Murcia CF and Córdoba CF. He negotiated his departure from Aris, themselves third-bottom in the Greek Super League, on Tuesday after less than two months in the role.
