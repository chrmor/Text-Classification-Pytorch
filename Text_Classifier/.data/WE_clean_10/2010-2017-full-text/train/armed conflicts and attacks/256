Guantánamo Bay files: China among regimes invited to interrogate captives
Foreign intelligence services from a host of repressive governments were brought in to identify and question suspects
During the nine-year life of Guantánamo the US has invited in at least 10 foreign intelligence agencies to interrogate inmates, and to share information on those they regarded as terrorists. This is in addition to frequent questioning by allied British and western intelligence officers.
Among those from repressive regimes who were invited to carry out interrogations were the Chinese, Tunisians, Moroccans, Russians, Saudis, Tajiks, Jordanians, Algerians, Yemenis and Kuwaitis. They helped identify inmates' true names. The Saudi security service, the Mabahith, itemised 37 of those it regarded as particularly dangerous, and 77 who the Saudi government claimed were of "low intelligence value" and were prepared to have back and "rehabilitate".
The Chinese and Russians made plain that they would prosecute and punish the interned Uighurs and Uzbeks if they were repatriated.
In 2002 the US invited the Saudis, Yemenis, Jordanians, Tunisians and Russians. In 2003 the Tajik security service was invited and the Kuwaitis the following year. The Chinese came before 2005, and in July 2005 the Yemenis came for a second time.
An Algerian delegation was invited in March 2006, and in March 2008 a third visit was recorded from Yemeni security officials. The date the Moroccans came is not clear.
