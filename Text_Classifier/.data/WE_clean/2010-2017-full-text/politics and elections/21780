Here is Denmark’s new government
Lars Løkke Rasmussen formally introduced his 17-person cabinet on Sunday morning. See who got what post here.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen officially assumed the role of Denmark’s prime minister on Sunday morning following a meeting with Queen Margrethe II. 
Rasmussen also released the names of his cabinet team, made up solely of members of his own Venstre party. Rasmussen decided to go it solo on Friday night after talks with other right-of-centre parties failed to reach consensus. 
Here then is Denmark’s new government:
Social Minister and Minister of the Interior Karen Ellemann
Rasmussen was selected to become prime minister following the June 18 election despite Venstre finishing in third place with 19.5 percent of the vote, behind Helle Thorning-Schmidt's Social Democrats and the far-right Danish People’s Party (DF), which saw support jump to 21.1 percent from 12.3 percent.
Despite the poor election performance, Rasmussen became PM due to the support of DF, Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives.
With just 34 mandates, the Venstre government will be Denmark’s smallest since 1973. That government, led by Venstre’s Poul Hartling, had just 22 mandates behind it and lasted only 14 months.
