Former President Jimmy Carter announces he has brain cancer
ATLANTA (AP) -- The latest on Jimmy Carter's first public comments since announcing his cancer diagnosis (all times local):
The doctor for former President Jimmy Carter says he will be getting cancer treatment that doesn't have the toxicity that treatments might have had even 20 years ago.
Dr. Walter Curran Jr., executive director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, said Thursday that Carter is receiving radiation and injections of a drug that was approved by FDA in February. The injection boosts a patient's immune system and helps a person's own immune system fight melanoma.
The drug doesn't have the "terrible side effects" that treatments a few decades had.
His treatments are scheduled to last for three months.
President Barack Obama says he and his wife are praying for former President Jimmy Carter as he undergoes treatment for cancer on his brain.
Obama said in a tweet Thursday afternoon that Carter "is as good a man as they come," adding: "We're all pulling for you, Jimmy."
Carter spoke about his cancer diagnosis earlier in the day, his first public remarks on the disease since he announced the diagnosis last week. Carter said during the morning news conference that the Obamas had called him to wish him well.
The cancer was first discovered in Carter's liver; melanoma was then discovered on four spots on his brain as well.
Former President Jimmy Carter is leaving open the possibility of taking a previously planned trip to Nepal despite undergoing radiation treatment for cancer on his brain.
Carter said Thursday in his first public remarks since revealing his cancer diagnosis that if he doesn't make the trip to Nepal in November, others from his family would probably go in his place. He says he will cut back on some work and his schedule. He says his first radiation treatment will be Thursday afternoon.
Carter also says he will teach Sunday School at his hometown in Plains, Georgia, this weekend, and that he plans to teach as long as he's able.
He appeared at the news conference in a dark blazer, red tie and jeans and was surrounded by friends and family.
Carter was the nation's 39th president, defeating Gerald Ford in 1976. Ronald Reagan succeeded him in 1980 after a landslide victory. Carter rebuilt his career as a humanitarian, founding the Carter Center in 1982 to focus on global health care and democracy. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
Former President Jimmy Carter says his cancer has shown up in his liver and on his brain and that he will undergo radiation treatment.
Carter said Thursday in his first public remarks since his diagnosis that the cancer was first discovered as a tumor on his liver. On Aug. 3, he says, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor. He says about one-tenth of his liver was removed.
But he says that later, four spots of melanoma were found on his brain. He says he will have his first radiation treatment Thursday afternoon.
He says no cancer has been found on his pancreas or any other part of his body so far. He says doctors are monitoring closely.
He says he will cut back "fairly dramatically" on work at his Carter Center in Atlanta. Several family members died of pancreatic cancer. He says treatment will be his top priority.
Carter says he is not feeling despair or anger over his health. He says he feels good, with only slight pain.
He says: "I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes. I'm ready for anything. I'm looking forward to a new adventure."

Ahead of a news conference for Jimmy Carter to publicly discuss his recent cancer diagnosis for the first time, his family has gathered and a single chair is placed behind a cloth-covered table, presumably for the former president to give his remarks.
Carter Center officials and members of the Carter family, including his grandson Jason Carter, are seated Thursday morning in the first reserved row, divided from reporters by blue ropes. The news conference is to begin at 10 a.m. at the Cater Center. Staffers also are gathered in an upstairs balcony.
The event is closed to the public.
The 90-year-old announced this month that recent liver surgery found cancer that has spread to other parts of his body. The three-sentence statement didn't identify the type of cancer or where it originated.
