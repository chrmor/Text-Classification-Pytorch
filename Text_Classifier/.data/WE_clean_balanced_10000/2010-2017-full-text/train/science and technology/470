Centuries-Old Shipwreck Found Off North Carolina Coast
Van Dover told the paper she had led four previous expeditions as early as 2012 to the same site and had no idea the wreckage was there.
“It’s ironic to think we were exploring within 100 meters of the wreck site without an inkling it was there," she said.
The team reported their find to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Heritage Program, which will attempt to date and identify the ship.
