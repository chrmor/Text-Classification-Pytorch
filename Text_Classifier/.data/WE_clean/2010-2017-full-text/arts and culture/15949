Cannes 2013 live blog day 1: The Great Gatsby premiere
Well, hello there. The red carpets are being unrolled, the paparazzi are installing their stepladders, the dressmakers are rushing their schmutters to the airport – the Cannes film festival is finally upon us. We'll be liveblogging every day of the 12-day jamboree, bringing you news and reviews from the Cote d'Azur literally as they happen. It cannot get any more exciting, I tell you.
So, tonight is the big one, the premiere of Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece of jazz age disillusion. It's bound to be a star-stuffed affair, what with that top-notch cast and it being the Cannes opening gala and all. Rest assured we'll be posting galleries of all the action later on.
The only slight dampener is that the cat is out of the bag somewhat: the film was released in the US last weekend, which means the usual respectful embargos have disintegrated. (Read a bit about the toings and froings here.)
Our critic Peter Bradshaw wasn't especially impressed, if we're being honest. Here's a sample:
Having watched this fantastically unthinking and heavy-handed adaptation, the opening gala of this year's Cannes festival, I feel the only way to make it less subtle would be to let Michael Bay direct it. As it is, the task has fallen to Baz Luhrmann, the director of Moulin Rouge! and Australia, a man who can't see a nuance without calling security for it to be thrown off his set.
You can read his full review here.
Other stuff to look forward to later on: Peter's review of the second competition film, Mexican drama Heli – about which remarkably little is known at this stage. We'll also have a gallery of the jury photocall, which includes Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Ang Lee among its number, and Charlotte Higgins' report from the Great Gatsby press conference. And of course, the first of Xan Brooks' legendary daily diaries.
