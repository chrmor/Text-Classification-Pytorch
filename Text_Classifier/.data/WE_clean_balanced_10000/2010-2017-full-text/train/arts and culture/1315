Why are older women invisible in Hollywood?
"Hollywood film-making continues to worship at the altar of the 18- to 25-year old male and his penis," she told an audience of fellow actresses in Los Angeles. "Quite small, I always think..."
Mischief-making aside, Dame Helen had a serious point to make about the dearth of roles for older women. Colleagues who worked "non-stop" from their 20s to their 40s suddenly found themselves invisible once they hit their 50s, she said.
And she's right. When did you last see Michelle Pfeiffer, 52, in a blockbuster movie? Where are the leading lady roles for Sharon Stone, another fiftysomething? And would Glenn Close, 63, be appearing in the (admittedly brilliant) Damages on TV if great film offers were landing on her doormat? Between them they have nine Oscar nominations but that counts for little once the crow's feet start to appear.
Why does Hollywood fail older women so miserably? Because the vast majority of writers are male. They write about what they know: what it's like to be a man. In the last 20 years, only four winners of the best original screenplay Oscar have been female. And the films they gave us? Thelma and Louise, The Piano, Lost in Translation and Juno, all of which had great roles for women at their centre.
It's not a new problem - as Dame Helen said: "Virtually every drama made for film, stage or television has 20 male characters to maybe one, two or, if you're lucky, three female characters. And that includes Shakespeare. Why do you think I had to play Prospero in The Tempest? I had to nick one of their roles."
