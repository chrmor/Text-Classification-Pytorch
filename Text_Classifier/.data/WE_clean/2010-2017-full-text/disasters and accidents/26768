From Paris to Bavaria, Heavy Rains Cause Deadly Floods
In addition to the man found dead in Évry-Grégy-sur-Yerre, an 86-year-old woman was also found dead Wednesday at her flooded home in Souppes-sur-Loing, a town just south of Nemours. But the cause of her death was unknown on Thursday and the local authorities said an autopsy would be conducted on Friday.
Traffic around Orléans, about 75 miles south of Paris, was blocked, and on Tuesday, 217 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Orléans. The Château de Chambord, a landmark in the Loire Valley, about 30 miles southwest of Orléans, was surrounded by water.
In Germany, the rains have claimed nine lives.
On Monday, in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, two people, including a firefighter, were sucked into a drainpipe in the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd; a 62-year-old man was found dead in a flooded basement garage in Weissbach; and a 13-year-old girl, seeking shelter under a railway bridge, was struck by a train and killed in Schorndorf.
On Thursday, five people were found dead in the southern German state of Bavaria. They included three women from one family, in a home in the town of Simbach am Inn; a 75-year-old man in the same town; and an 80-year-old woman in the neighboring village of Julbach.
Three others were missing, and the death toll could rise, Michael Emmer, a spokesman for the police in the Lower Bavaria region, told the German news agency DPA.
Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said the intensity of the flooding had taken officials by surprise. “Within a few minutes, the water level rose about several meters,” he said.
