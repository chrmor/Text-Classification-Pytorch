St. PAUL, Minn.—Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said racism appears to have been a factor in the fatal shooting of a black man by a police officer Wednesday evening—the aftermath of which was captured on video and livestreamed by the man’s girlfriend.
“Nobody should be shot and killed in Minnesota for a taillight being out of function,” Mr. Dayton, said in a Thursday afternoon news conference.
