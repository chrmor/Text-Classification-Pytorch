U.S. stocks staged a rebound in late trading Wednesday as the major indexes climbed back from sharp early losses and closed mostly higher.
Stocks initially tumbled as anxious investors grappled with the the ripple effects caused by a further devaluation of China's currency and rising concerns about the health of China's wobbly economy.
But after a sharp knee-jerk reaction to the downside, investors apparently are starting to question whether China’s move to devalue its currency is the start of a full-fledged currency war.
“I think the term is overly dramatic,” says Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. “I don’t believe other countries will respond to this in a dramatic way.”
Skrainka also points out that China’s 2% devaluation of the yuan Tuesday and a further drop today is “not a major deal” from a historical perspective, especially given that the U.S. dollar has already seen a roughly 30% rise in its current rally.
“This issue has been blown way out of proportion,” adds Nick Sargen, chief economist at Fort Washington Investment Advisors.
Standard & poor’s Ratings Services also downplayed the negative fallout from China’s recent moves in the currency market. “China’s surprise move to allow for more exchange rate flexibility makes good economic sense and is not the start of a currency war.”
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down almost 270 points earlier in the trading session, or 1.5%, pared losses and closed basically flat, falling just 0.33 to 17,402.51. The dramatic comeback follows the Dow's 212-point drop on Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.98 points, or 0.1%, to 2086.05, after dropping as much as 1.3% earlier in the session and slipping briefly into the red for 2015. The Nasdaq composite index gained 7.60, or 0.2%, to 5044.39.
Oil prices recouped a small portion of Tuesday's losses as U.S. benchmark crude rose 0.6% to $43.36 a barrel, following Tuesday's 4.2% drop.
China, which is the world's second-biggest economy, has been a major driving force of the global economy for years. Given China's clout in the world economy, any signs of a more severe slowdown there is viewed bearishly by investors, as slower growth equates to less sales, smaller corporate profits and, subsequently, lower stock prices.
China's central bank said that the daily reference or fixing rate for the yuan against the dollar stood at 1.6% Wednesday after it was cut by 1.9% Tuesday in an effort to boost its lagging economy by making its goods more affordable to foreign buyers.
The moves sent Asian and European markets plunging for a second day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1.6% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 2.4%. The Shanghai Composite was 1.1% lower.
European shares tumbled Wednesday — Germany’s DAX index plunged 3.3%, France’s CAC 40 was 3.4% lower and Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 1.4%. The Athens Stock Exchange was 1.5% lower.
"Risky assets remain under pressure," Guillermo Felices of Barcalys told clients in a report. "A key market concern is that the latest (Chinese) measures respond to much weaker Chinese growth than expected."
