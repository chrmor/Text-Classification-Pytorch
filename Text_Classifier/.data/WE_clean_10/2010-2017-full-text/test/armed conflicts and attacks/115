Israeli Stocks Retreat Most in a Week as Israel, Arabs Clash
Israeli shares tumbled the most in more than a week amid army clashes in the Palestinian territories and at the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Gas shares slid as drilling at Leviathan 2 was halted.
Delek Drilling-LP and Avner Oil Exploration LP, partners in the Leviathan project off the country’s coast, slid the most since January. The TA-25 Index retreated 1 percent to 1,277.74 at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the most since May 5.
“The current incidents raise the uncertainty of the local market and the risk of investing in it,” said Eyal Dabby, head of equity research at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. “After the big drop due to high concern the incidents may escalate into a bigger scale crisis, investors found that it may remain a local and a temporary issue.”
Israeli soldiers opened fire as demonstrators marched on the borders from Syria, Lebanon and Gaza and as many as nine people were killed on the day that Palestinians mark the establishment of the state of Israel with protests. Also, Israeli police are investigating whether a fatal traffic accident earlier today in Tel Aviv in which the driver, a resident of the Arab town Kafr Kassem, killed one person and injured five, was “deliberate.”
Delek Drilling retreated 4 percent to 12.5 shekels and Avner lost 5.1 percent to 2.185 shekels, the biggest declines since Jan. 2. Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd., the operator of the Leviathan project off Israel’s coast, notified the explorers that it decided to stop drilling at Leviathan 2 because of water flow and that an alternative assessment drilling would be made at a nearby location.
Government bonds advanced, pushing the yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit note due January 2020 down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.13 percent.
