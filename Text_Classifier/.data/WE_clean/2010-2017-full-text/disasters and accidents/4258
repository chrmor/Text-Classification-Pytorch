30 miners feared dead in north Colombia coalmine
At least 30 miners are trapped and feared dead following an explosion in a coal mine in the northern Colombian department of Norte de Santander, Colombian media reported Wednesday.
Authorities say that the chance that the miners survived the explosion is slim.
The explosion occurred early Wednesday morning in a mine in the municipality of Sardanita and injured at least ten miners. According to a local security official, at least one person has been confirmed dead.
The local ombudsman told RCN Radio that the number of miners killed in the explosion may rise to 40, “because one person who was going to enter the mine said that was the number of people who would go inside for the morning shift.”
According to Caracol Radio, an explosion in the same mine killed 31 miners four years ago.
