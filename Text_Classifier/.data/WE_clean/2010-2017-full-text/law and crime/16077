UK police: 3 more suspects arrested in Woolwich soldier killing
Police did not detail how they were allegedly tied to the killing, nor did they release their identities, saying only that the men -- ages 21, 24 and 28 -- were arrested by detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command and taken to a south London police station.
One of the two suspects arrested at the scene approached a man filming the scene in the Woolwich neighborhood and suggested that Rigby had been targeted only "because Muslims are dying daily" at the hands of British troops such as him.
At the time, Adebolajo himself was a follower of the group and attended meetings in London, according to several Al-Muhajiroun insiders, before moving away from the group two or three years ago.
He said their circle of friends in Luton included Taimour Abdulwahab al Abdaly, who carried out a suicide bombing in Stockholm in December 2010 in which he was the only fatality.
It is understood that the two individuals suspected in the knife and cleaver attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had featured in previous investigations into other individuals, but were not themselves under surveillance.
