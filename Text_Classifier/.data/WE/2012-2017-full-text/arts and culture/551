Highlights from the 2012 Brit Awards
Adele has capped a year of global success with two prizes at this year's Brit Awards ceremony in London.
The star added the Brits for best British female and British album to the six Grammy Awards she won last weekend.
But former X Factor boy band One Direction beat her to the award for best British single.
Ed Sheeran also won two awards - best British male and British breakthrough - while Coldplay were crowned best British group for a record third time.
