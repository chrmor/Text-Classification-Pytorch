Zaha Hadid scoops Stirling Prize for architecture on fourth attempt
Hadid was yesterday awarded the prestigious architecture prize for MAXXI, the National Museum of XXI Century Arts in Rome.
The Iraqi-born architect, who had been nominated on three previous occasions for projects in Germany and Austria, was the bookmakers' favourite to win the Â£20,000 prize, which she was due to collect during a ceremony at The Roundhouse in London last night.
MAXXI, which was completed in November 2009, was described by the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) judges as "a mature piece of architecture ... a place of paths and routes ... bravely daylit with a sinuous roof of controllable skylights, louvres and beams which orientate and excite the visitor creating uplifting spaces.
"It is the quintessence of Zaha's constant attempt to create a landscape, a series of cavernous spaces drawn with a free, roving line. The resulting piece, rather than giving prescribed routes, gives the visitor a sense of exploration. It is perhaps her best work to date."
Hadid has also designed the Aquatics Centre in Stratford, east London, which will be the main venue for swimming events at the London 2012 Olympics.
The RIBA Stirling Prize is awarded to the architects of the best European building that is built or designed in Britain.
Others shortlisted for this year's prize included Rick Mather Architects for the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Theis and Khan for Bateman's Row, London, DSDHA for Christ's College School, Guildford, dRMM for Clapham Manor Primary School, London, and David Chipperfield Architects with Julian Harrap Architects for the Neues Museum, in Berlin.
Ruth Reed, the President of RIBA, said: "In MAXXI we have a much deserved winner, and I am delighted to award Zaha Hadid Architects with architecture's highest accolade."
