Roadside Bomb Kills Seven Civilians In Eastern Afghanistan
Afghan officials say at least seven civilians, including a woman and three children, were killed when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan on January 15.
The villagers were traveling from Pacheer Agam district to a nearby village in Nangarhar Province, district Governor Hijratullah Rahmani told the AFP news agency.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which the Interior Ministry blamed on "enemies of peace and stability," a term Afghan officials use to refer to Taliban militants.
The Taliban has a strong presence in Nangarhar, a volatile province that borders Pakistan.
The Islamic State (IS) extremist group has also gained a foothold in eastern Afghanistan in recent years.
Earlier, Afghan officials said that IS fighters had been driven out of Pacheer Agam in an operation by security forces.
In a separate development in Nangarhar, officials said IS militants abducted 13 lecturers of the Haska Mina religious school on January 15.
Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said "the teachers were taking exams from students in Shpoly area, when they were abducted."
Provincial government said in a statement that security forces have begun an operation to release the lecturers.
