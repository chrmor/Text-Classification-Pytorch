Tom Perez Becomes DNC Chair in Close Election Victory
Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, the preferred candidate of the Bernie Sanders wing of the party, came in second, earning 200 votes in the second round of votes.
Ellison said it was necessary to unite behind Perez for the party to move forward, and was appointed the party's deputy chairman.
"We don’t have the luxury, folks, to walk out of this room divided," Ellison said. "We don’t have that luxury, and I just want to say to you that it’s my honor to serve this party under Chairman Perez."
The other five candidates dropped out of the race before the second round of votes.
Mayor Pete Buttigeig of South Bend, Indiana, did not make it to the voting process, announcing during his nomination speech earlier Saturday that he would be exiting the race. Buttigeig, 35, built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean.
"It looks like I’m not going to be the next chair," Buttigeig said. “But whoever is, I am urging to do the things that must be done to be open to change, to look beyond Washington, to not treat the presidency like it’s the only office that matters, to pay attention to communities like ours in the heart of our country — not as an exotic species — but as your fellow Americans."
The former Naval intelligence officer campaigned on the idea that the aging Democratic Party needs to empower its millennial members.
The 447 members of the Democratic National Committee voted Saturday afternoon, gathering in a ballroom to cast their ballots for chair and other party officer positions. Half ballots were given to Democrats voting abroad.
