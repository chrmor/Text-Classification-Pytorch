ANKARA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from the second blast in an industrial neighborhood of Turkish capital Ankara rose to six, Ankara Mayor Melik Gokcel said on Thursday.
The blast which occurred at around 7:45 p.m. in a bio-diesel filling station in OSTIM, Ankara's main industrial area, triggered a fire and blew up an LPG vehicle in front of the building.
Gokcel said at least eight workers were currently trapped in the building, while rescue teams were trying to extinguish the fire.

"We have counted six dead, 27 others injured," Turkish Interior Minister Besir Atalay was quoted as saying by Anatolia news agency.
