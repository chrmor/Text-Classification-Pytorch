Swiss tourist gang-raped in India
New Delhi - A group of eight men allegedly raped a 39-year-old Swiss tourist and assaulted her husband in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, police said on Saturday. The crime took place at a village near Datia town late Friday, said district superintendent of police CS Solanki. The couple were travelling by bicycle from the temple town of Orchha to Seonda when they stopped to camp near the village for the night, Solanki said. Eight men attacked the couple with wooden sticks, beat up and overpowered the husband and raped the woman, according to the complaint made by the husband, Solanki said. They also looted the couple's belongings before fleeing, Solanki added. The woman had been admitted to a hospital in the nearby town of Gwalior, with preliminary tests confirming that she had been raped, NDTV news channel reported, citing police sources. Solanki said eight people had been detained for questioning in connection with the incident but that police were still searching for all of the attackers. The rising number of rape cases in India has been a cause of concern, especially after a 23-year-old woman was gang raped in a moving bus in the Indian capital in December 2012. A total of 24 206 cases of rape were reported in 2011, according to government data. The figures for 2012 have not yet been collated.
