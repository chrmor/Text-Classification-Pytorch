Hundreds of Migrants Rescued From Dinghies in Mediterranean
Migrants fleeing Libya on board a dinghy wait to be rescued by emergency teams, as they sailed in the Mediterranean sea towards the Italian coast, about 17 miles north of Sabratha, Libya, on Aug. 28, 2016. More than seven hundred migrants were rescued Sunday morning from seven boats by members of the Proactiva Open Arms NGO before transferring them to the Italian coast guard.
