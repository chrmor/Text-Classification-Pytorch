Joko Widodo Appears to Have Edge in Jakarta Governor’s Race
JAKARTA, Indonesia — Voters in the Indonesian capital cast their ballots for a new governor on Thursday, with exit polls suggesting victory for the populist mayor of a city in central Java over the incumbent.
Surveys of voters conducted by the Indonesia Survey Institute, an independent organization, showed Joko Widodo, the mayor of Surakarta, pulling in 54 percent of the vote and Gov. Fauzi Bowo of Jakarta taking 46 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. Official results are not expected for at least another week, but exit polls by the same organization accurately predicted the outcome of the first round of voting in July.
In that vote, Mr. Joko emerged as the surprise leader in a race that has stirred unusual enthusiasm among voters who say they are sick of corruption and politicians who have done little to address the city’s notoriously clogged traffic, poor sanitation and slums.
Mr. Joko has made the most of his reputation for running a clean and efficient administration in Surakarta in promoting his message of change. His campaign was also notable for its use of social media. Mr. Joko’s team made efforts to reach out to voters with Skype conversations and YouTube music videos.
Last month his supporters set their own words to the tune from a song by One Direction to highlight Jakarta’s most intractable problems: flooding, bribery and traffic congestion.
Analysts said that a change in Jakarta’s leadership could mark the beginning of a bigger political change in national elections two years from now.
