Pretoria - Oscar Pistorius was rushed to Pretoria’s Kalafong Hospital yesterday after sustaining injuries to his wrists in jail.
While correctional services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the Paralympian told authorities he had injured himself after falling out of bed, an inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally.
Two warders with knowledge of the hospital section said blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.
Two security guards at Kalafong Hospital, which is situated east of Pretoria, told City Press on Saturday that Pistorius was admitted at 12:30.
“He had bad cuts on his wrists and the doctors kept wrapping bandages around them,” said one.
Pistorius, they said, was being guarded at the hospital by more than 10 warders.
