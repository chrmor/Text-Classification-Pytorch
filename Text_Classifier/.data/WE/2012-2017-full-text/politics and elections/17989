Turkey Threatens Stronger Military Action in Syria
ISTANBULâ€”President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened Thursday to take stronger military action inside Syria to halt relentless Islamic State rocket attacks that have brought life in parts of one Turkish border town to a standstill.
After weeks of deadly Islamic State strikes, Mr. Erdogan suggested that Turkey was prepared to send troops into neighboring Syria to bring an end to attacks on Kilis, the Turkish town nominated this year for a Nobel Peace Prize for welcoming so many Syrian refugees.
