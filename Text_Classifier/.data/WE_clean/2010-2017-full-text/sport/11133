Niagara Falls crossing a world first
Cheered on by thousands of spectators, US tightrope walker Nik Wallenda has fulfilled his childhood dream of walking on a tightrope across Niagara Falls and into the history books.
Crowds packed the US and Canadian sides of the border to watch the 33-year-old brave strong winds and heavy spray to walk on a cable suspended around 60 metres up over the biggest waterfall in North America.
After a brief prayer, Wallenda climbed on the cable and headed from New York to Canada. With the aid of a long balancing pole, Wallenda carefully found his footing along the lengthy cable and maintained a laser-like focus on his task throughout.
The hair-raising walk took 25 minutes, less than the expected 35 to 40 minutes. He jumped down from the high wire on the Canadian side at 10.40pm (0220 GMT).
