Greece votes in European and second-round local elections
Greece votes in the European elections and the second round of local elections.
Greek political parties have been playing on voters’ fears of more austerity measures and political instability.
One local resident said: “This election should have been only for Europe, but other political dilemmas have also been put forward. I believe that there will be a big debate and lots of criticism, but it is essential that we stay in Europe.”
Another commented: “This election is for Europe as well as for the situation in Greece. It is about the jobs that we have lost. This is what we are voting for today.”
Our euronews correspondent in Athens said: “This is a crucial election for Greece, as after four years of austerity, its outcome may trigger rapid political developments and even lead to national elections.”
