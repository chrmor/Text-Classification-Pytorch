7 Killed in Yemen
Officials in southern Yemen say a gunman has opened fire on a minibus carrying medical personnel, killing at least seven people and wounding about a dozen others. The attack happened Sunday in the south's main city of Aden. Yemen, an impoverished Arab country, borders oil giant Saudi Arabia and is home to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the global Islamist militant group's most active wings.
