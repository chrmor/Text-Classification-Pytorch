Oscar Pistorius charged with murder of Reeva Steenkamp- as it happened
The Guardian's David Smithhas also sent some more reaction to Reeva Steenkamp's death:Â 
Steenkamp had featured in the South African edition of FHM magazine. Hagen Engler, its former editor, said he had known her since around the age of 15 in Port Elizabeth, where they both grew up. "She was the face of Avon or something like that," he said. "She was an amazing girl, a really intelligent person.
"She was a businesswoman as well and I think she had a law degree. She went into the modelling industry and had a mature understanding of it. She had a good sense of humour, like a guy's sense of humour.
"She moved to Johannesburg and put on a bit of weight, but she was determined to succeed in the world of modelling and she really worked at it. In a couple of years she was gorgeous."
Engler, a freelance journalist, added: "She was talented and was starting to succeed and get a bit of a following. The girl was really going places."
He had not seen her with Pistorius. "When the newspapers started saying Oscar Pistorius was going out with her, it was like: 'That's my girl.' But I'm no expert on her relationship status."
Her death came as a huge shock. "It's a hammer-blow. It was like, 'I know her, oh my God.' I've been trying to process it. It's a real tragedy that such a bright girl has gone."
A spokesperson for the magazine said: "FHM was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic passing of FHM cover girl Reeva Steenkamp. Our thoughts go out to her family and friends during this difficult and painful time.
"FHM knew Reeva as a beautiful, intelligent and warm-hearted woman who was a joy to work with and everyone at FHM mourns her untimely passing. May she rest in peace."
