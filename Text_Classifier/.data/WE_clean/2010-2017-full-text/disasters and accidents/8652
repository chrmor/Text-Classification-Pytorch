International aid group Oxfam has launched an emergency appeal to help millions of people caught in the middle of huge floods in Pakistan.
More than 200 people have died and about 5 million have been affected by severe flooding in the southern Pakistani province of Sindh.
The situation has worsened after heavy rains in the past 10 days.
Aid workers from Oxfam say families desperately need drinking water and sanitation or more lives will be lost.
The United Nations World Food Program announced earlier this week it will provide emergency rations to more than half a million people.
Sindh province was also hit by last year's record-breaking flood disaster.
But one official says the situation now is even worse than last year.
"So far, 209 people have been killed and 5.3 million affected," Zafar Qadir, head of the country's disaster management authority, told reporters yesterday.
"Around 1.7 million acres of agricultural land has also been affected by the rains and floods."
