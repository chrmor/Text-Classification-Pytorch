Israel rejects Kerry ceasefire deal, IDF death toll 35; 6 killed in West Bank
John Kerry is speaking now, praising his hosts, and PA chief Abbas, for pushing for a ceasefire as soon as possible.
He talks about the grief and blood of the conflict.
He says Israel is being battered by rockets and targeted through terror tunnels, and cites the death of lone soldier Max Steinberg. “In Gaza hundreds of Palestinians have been killed,” he says, citing yesterday’s attack at a UN school and other incidents.
“Violence breeds violence,” he declares, and calls for “long-term change” that he says “both parties really want.”
Specifically, he says “we are working towards a brief seven days of peace. Seven days of a humanitarian ceasefire in honor of (the Muslim festival) Eid” — leading to talks on a more durable arrangement. “The basic structure is built on the Egyptian initiative,” he says. But the humanitarian element is built on.
Egypt has offered to bring the “Palestinian factions” to Cairo, along with other interested parties, and Israel, for these talks. “We still have some terminology” to work through. “But we are confident that we have a fundamental framework” that can work, he says.
“We don’t yet have that framework” agreed upon by all, he says, “but none of us are stopping.”
Kerry says he just spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who “made it clear that he wants to find a way forward.”
He says UN chief Ban Ki-moon is pushing a 12-hour time out.
Kerry says he’s flying to Paris tomorrow to meet with “other players who are important to this discussion” to try and narrow the gap, and that Netanyahu is committed to trying to do that.
