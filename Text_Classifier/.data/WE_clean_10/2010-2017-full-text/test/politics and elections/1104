Moldova Vote Gives Edge to Parties Looking West
MOSCOW — Three pro-European political parties appeared to have won enough votes in a weekend election to control Moldova’s Parliament, despite a surprising first-place finish by the pro-Russian Socialist Party, according to preliminary results on Monday.
Shadowed by the continuing violence in neighboring Ukraine, the election in Moldova, one of Europe’s smallest and poorest nations, became another fierce contest between the West and Russia for influence in a former Soviet republic.
Moldova, like Ukraine, has moved steadily toward greater political and economic integration with the European Union. But it has come under severe pressure from Russia to change course. Russia banned the import of Moldovan wine last year, and in recent months, it followed up with bans on apples, meat and other food products — brutal blows to the nation’s economy, which depends heavily on agriculture.
Russia already plays a significant role in Moldova because of the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence in 1990 and was the subject of a military conflict in 1992. Russian troops have long been stationed in Transnistria as peacekeeping forces.
