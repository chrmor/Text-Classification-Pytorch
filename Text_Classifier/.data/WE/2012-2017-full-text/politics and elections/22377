Emmanuel Macron's party on course for huge majority in French parliament
Emmanuel Macron's party is on course to secure an historic majority in parliament after the first round of France’s legislative elections, turbo-charging the French president’s chances of driving through crucial economic reforms.
But the massive showing just four weeks after Mr Macron’s surprise triumph in the presidential election was marred by record low turnout of below 50 per cent, the lowest in modern French history.
Defying expectations that his new political party would struggle to wrest control of parliament from the traditional Right and Left, early exit polls suggested Mr Macron’s La République En Marche (REM) party, along with its centrist Modem allies, was on course to win around 33 per cent of the vote.
