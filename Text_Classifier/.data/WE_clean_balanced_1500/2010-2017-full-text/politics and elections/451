Jewell Confirmed as Interior Secretary
The Senate voted 87 to 11 Wednesday to confirm Sally Jewell, chief executive of the outdoor retailer REI, as interior secretary.
Ms. Jewell, 57, will oversee more than 500 million acres of national parks and other public lands, and more than one billion acres offshore. The lands are used for energy development, mining, recreation and other purposes.
The department also provides services to 566 Indian tribes. Ms. Jewell previously worked as a petroleum engineer and banker. She also served on the board of the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group for national parks. She replaces Ken Salazar, who announced his departure in January.
