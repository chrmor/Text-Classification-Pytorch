Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer fractures shoulder in biking accident in D.C.
Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer underwent shoulder-replacement surgery Saturday morning after taking a spill on his bicycle the previous afternoon near the Korean War Veterans Memorial.
Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement that the 74-year-old justice is “resting comfortably” after undergoing shoulder replacement surgery for a proximal humerus fracture, a common break in the shoulder joint. Breyer was taken to the hospital in an ambulance after his fall, Arberg said.
Arberg said the surgery on his right shoulder was “successful,” and Breyer is expected to be released from MedStar Georgetown University Hospital early in the week.
It was the third biking accident for the justice, who two years ago broke his right collarbone after a fall near his home in Cambridge, Mass. He suffered more serious injuries in 1993 when he was hit by a car while biking across Harvard Square.
