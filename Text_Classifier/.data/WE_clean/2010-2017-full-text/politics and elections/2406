Croatian Premier Kosor Survives No-Confidence Vote in Parliament
The government of Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament when a motion supported by the opposition failed to muster enough support.
“The motion for no-confidence was rejected,” Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic said earlier today after a 15-hour debate. One lawmaker in the 153-seat parliament abstained in the 79-62 vote. At least 77 votes were needed to support the no-confidence motion.
Led by the Social-Democrats, the opposition last week filed a no-confidence motion against Kosor and her ruling Croatian Democratic Union, saying the government is damaged by corruption scandals and has failed to lead the country out of recession.
As Croatia enters the last round of negotiations for the planned 2012 entry to the European Union, at least 20 top ruling party members have been investigated or charged with abuse of authority and other corruption-related crimes in the last three months.
The Balkan’s country economy is expected to contract 1.5 percent this year, the second year in a row.
