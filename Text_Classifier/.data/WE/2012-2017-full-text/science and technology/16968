Cuba: Local transmission of Zika reported in Havana
A 21-year-old woman from Havana with no travel history outside Cuba is the first autochthonous, or locally transmitted Zika virus infection,according to a  La Nación report (computer translated). Local mosquito transmission means that mosquitoes in the area are infected with Zika virus and are spreading it to people.
The health ministry said in a statement, “The young woman who had no history of traveling abroad began to show symptoms of headache, retro-orbital pain, decay and conjunctivitis on March 7.” On Monday, a blood test confirmed the diagnosis. The patient remains hospitalized.
Prior to this indigenous Zika case, Cuba has reported a handful of travel-associated Zika cases,according to Spanish language media, all imported from Venezuela.
Ninety miles north of Cuba, Florida health officials reported an additional two imported Zika virus cases in Miami-Dade County, bringing the state’s total to 62. Patients had travel history to the following countries: Brazil, Brazil/Bolivia/Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Honduras/Guatemala, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.
