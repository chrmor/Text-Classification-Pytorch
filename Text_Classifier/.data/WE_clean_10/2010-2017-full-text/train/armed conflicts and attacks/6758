Yemen's Saleh leaves hospital, Saudi says
(CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been discharged from a military hospital in Saudi Arabia after being severely wounded in June, a Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman said Sunday, but it was not clear when he would return to Yemen.
Saleh left the hospital on Saturday and will be staying in Riyadh, hosted by the Saudi government, Foreign Ministry spokesman Osama Nogali told CNN.
Saleh suffered severe burns and shrapnel wounds during an assassination attempt in June amid a tribal revolt against his 32-year rule. Yemen's largest opposition bloc has vowed to prevent him from returning.
Saleh's vice president, Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has been running the government since then.
Protests against Saleh began in January, following the successful uprising in Tunisia that triggered region-wide reform movements. The protests led to open street battles after Saleh balked at a deal with the opposition that would have eased him out of office within a month.
