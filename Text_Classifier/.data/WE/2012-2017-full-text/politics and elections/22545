Venezuelan Top Court Imposes Travel Ban, Asset Freeze on Chief Prosecutor
Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice banned prosecutor general Luisa Ortega Diaz from leaving the country.
CARACAS (Sputnik) — Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice on Wednesday banned prosecutor general Luisa Ortega Diaz from leaving the country and froze her assets, pending next week’s court hearing.
"The precautionary measures agreed by the plenary chamber to guarantee procedural action consist of the following: a prohibition on citizen Luisa Ortega Diaz to leave the country… and freeze on all bank accounts," the court said in a statement.
The court reportedly ruled on Tuesday there was enough evidence to start procedures against the outspoken prosecutor at a request of a lawmaker from President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling Socialist party. She is expected to testify at a court hearing on July 4.
Ortega has been increasingly critical of President Maduro and his decision to call a special assembly to rewrite the constitution as a way out of the deepening political crisis. She previously filed a lawsuit to the Supreme Tribunal asking to strip immunity from eight justices, followed by three suits against the constituent assembly.
