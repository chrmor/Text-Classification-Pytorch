Maldives leaves Commonwealth as it claims unfair treatment in row over reforms
The Maldiveshas left the Commonwealth, claiming it was "unfairly and unjustly" treated by the global body that was due to consider sanctions - including suspension - against the nation after its "lack of progress" on a raft of democratic reforms.
Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland said she and the family of nations were saddened and disappointed by the decision, but hoped the move would be only a "temporary separation".
The islands have been in political turmoil since its first democratically-elected leader Mohamed Nasheed resigned in 2012 - the outsted leader claims he was deposed at gunpoint.
In the years that followed, the authorities in the Maldives have been accused of a string of political and democratic violations.
