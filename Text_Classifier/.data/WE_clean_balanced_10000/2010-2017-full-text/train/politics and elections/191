Argentine Leader Appears to Face Setbacks in Vote
BUENOS AIRESâ€”Argentina's populist President Cristina Kirchner appears to have lost her gamble in casting Sunday's congressional initial elections as a virtual referendum on her government amid a backdrop of high inflation and a weak economy.
The leader's Victory Front coalition did poorly in several important electoral districts, most notably Buenos Aires Province, and could struggle to retain control of Congress in October's midterm elections if Sunday's preliminary result proves to be a true measure of her support.
