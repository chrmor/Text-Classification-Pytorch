US drone attack kills al-Qaeda members in Yemen
The Yemen defence ministry said the two men, who were driving a car in Shabwa province in the east of the country, were brothers, but did not name them or give further details. Locally based journalists identified them as Abdullah and Mubarak al-Harad, and one report said the real target may have been a senior al-Qaeda operative of Saudi origin who was on his way to meet them.
The strike was the first to be launched since the killing of Osama Bin Laden, and will prompt questions about whether it was coincidental or a result of information gleaned from intelligence material seized from his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
But Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen, is known to be led by a mixture of veteran Yemeni militants and fighters from neighbouring Saudi Arabia driven out by Riyadh’s tough policies against them in the last six years. Some are former inmates of the Guantanamo Bay internment facility.
AQAP is currently the best-organised branch of the movement, organising attacks against western targets both at home and abroad from areas where government authority is weak, such as Shabwa.
The United States is thought to have begun using drones and cruise missiles to target operatives in 2009. This was always denied, but a cable released by Wikileaks gave evidence that the Yemeni government’s approval to the strikes had been won with a promise that it would able to lie about them.
The strikes were suspended last year after a missile struck a car carrying a deputy governor. It has been alleged that he had been lured into a trap by Al-Qaeda operatives who had offered to negotiate with him, with the drone targeting his car instead of theirs.
