Taliban shoots Shiite passengers on minibuses in western Afghanistan: officials
KABUL, Afghanistan - An Afghan official says Taliban insurgents halted minibuses in western Afghanistan, identified 14 Shiite passengers and shot them dead by the side of the road.
Sayed Anwar Rahmati, the governor of the western Ghor province, says the Taliban halted three minibuses traveling from Kabul overnight Friday which were carrying around 30 passengers.
After questioning the passengers, the Islamic militants identified 14, including three women, as Hazara Shiites. The insurgents then bound the passengers' hands, let them away and shot them.
Rahmati says the other passengers were released.
The dead included a couple who were engaged and two relatives travelling with them. Rahmati says the passengers had gone to Kabul to shop for the upcoming holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
