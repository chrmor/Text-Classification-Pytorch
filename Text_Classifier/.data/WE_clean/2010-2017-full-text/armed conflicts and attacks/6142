Houston nursery pupils injured as boy's gun goes off in school cafeteria
Two six-year-olds and a five-year-old hurt as firearm drops from boy's pocket during lunch break and discharges a bullet
A six-year-old nursery school pupil brought a gun to school and was among three students injured by fragments when it dropped from his pocket during lunchtime and accidentally fired, officials said.
One bullet discharged about 11 am local time (1700 BST) in the school's cafeteria, spraying fragments at the students, said police spokesman Robert Mock.
"Either some type of chips off the floor, or it could be pieces of the round that discharged," Mock said. "They had some cuts and stuff on their legs, they don't appear to be life threatening."
Two six-year-old boys, including the one who had the gun, were wounded in the foot, said district spokesman Jason Spencer. A five-year-old girl also suffered a foot injury, Spencer said.
Images taken from Houston television station KPRC's news helicopter showed three children being wheeled to ambulances on stretchers. All were sitting up and appeared to be talking with emergency personnel. Upset parents rushed to the scene.
Houston is the largest school district in Texas with more than 200,000 students.
