Castro admits to marginalising gays
Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro has acknowledged discrimination against homosexuals during his rule in the 1960s and 70s, decrying the "great injustice" suffered by gays in the country.
"If there is someone responsible, it is me... but for sure at the time I could not be concerned with this matter," he told Mexican newspaper La Jornada in an interview published on Tuesday on the official website Cubadebate.cu.
"I found myself primarily immersed in the October Crisis (the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962), in war, in political issues," said the 84-year-old Castro, who only recently has emerged from years of seclusion following surgery that ended his 48-year rule of the island.
Castro did not blame the ruling Communist Party for the discrimination, instead regretting that he himself did not pay enough attention to the plight of gays during an era of sabotage, armed attacks and assassination plots against him.
"Avoiding the CIA, which bought so many traitors, was not easy, but if anyone has to take responsibility, I take mine. I will not hold anyone else responsible," Castro said.
Like other Cubans, including some priests, considered "ideological deviants," gays in the 1960s were sent to labour camps for re-education and rehabilitation. Discrimination continued in the 1970s, with gays, in particular gay artists and writers, disgraced, marginalised, or in some cases driven into exile.
