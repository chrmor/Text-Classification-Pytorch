The remnants of a devastating typhoon swept through eastern China on Sunday, leaving at least 22 people dead, homes destroyed and millions of people without power.
After lashing Taiwan and leaving at least five people dead and scores injured, Typhoon Soudelor hit Putian City in southeastern China's Fujian Province on Saturday night, and was downgraded into a tropical storm as it moved across the region.
China's official Xinhua news agency reported that power to more than two million homes was affected, according to State Grid Fujian Electric Power Co., Ltd.
The typhoon triggered mudslides in the mountainous Pingyang county in Zhejiang province, north of Fujian, killing nine people and leaving three others missing, Xinhua reported. More than 370,000 people were evacuated and around 32,000 boats were ordered back to port before the typhoon struck land, the AP said.
Typhoon Soudelor made landfall in Taiwan on Saturday, leaving at least five people dead and at least 185 injured. An 80-year-old man was found drowned in his home and a man was killed by a falling tree, the Taipei Times reported.
An 8-year-old girl, her twin sister and their mother were swept out to sea, a firefighter was killed and another was injured after being hit by a drunk driver as they tried to move a fallen tree, the AP reported. More than 4 million homes in Taiwan were left without power as a result of the typhoon, and more than 500 flights were canceled or delayed, the news agency added.
Three airports in Fujian Province were closed, and more than 530 flight canceled Sunday, Xinhua reported.
