15 dead in NATO tanker fire in Pakistan
At least 15 people were killed in an oil tanker blaze after a bomb exploded on the Afghanistan-bound NATO vehicle near a Pakistani border town on Saturday.
The victims were young people who had gathered to collect oil leaking from the tanker near Landi Kotal town in the northwestern tribal region of Khyber, local administration official Shafeerullah Wazir said.
''The oil tanker caught fire after a blast caused by a small bomb before dawn,'' he said.
''Villagers from nearby houses rushed and started collecting oil coming out of the destroyed tanker after the fire had been extinguished,'' he said.
''Suddenly the fire erupted again and at least 15 people including five young boys who had been collecting oil in their buckets were burnt to death,'' he said.
