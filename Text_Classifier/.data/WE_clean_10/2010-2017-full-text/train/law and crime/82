Businessman Wanted in Fatal South Korean Ferry Disaster Is Found Dead
SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s most wanted man, a church leader and businessman whom prosecutors had hoped to arrest in connection with an April ferry disaster that killed more than 300 people, has been found dead, the police said on Tuesday.
The man, Yoo Byung-eun, had been the target of the country’s largest manhunt ever since a court issued an arrest warrant for him in May on charges of embezzlement, breach of trust and tax evasion. Prosecutors sought to arrest him as one of those who had contributed to the sinking of the 6,825-ton ferry Sewol.
They said they had determined that Mr. Yoo, 73, was a real owner and top manager of Chonghaejin Marine Company, the operator of the ferry. Mr. Yoo and members of his family strained the company’s finances by taking large sums, forcing it to spend little on the safety training for the ferry’s crew, the prosecutors said.
“National forensic officials told us that a DNA test showed that it was him,” said Woo Hyong-ho, chief of the police in Suncheon, a city near the southern coast of South Korea.
