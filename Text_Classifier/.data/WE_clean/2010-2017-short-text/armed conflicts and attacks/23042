The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports the Islamic State, on Sunday, executed three detainees in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra by strapping them to pillars and blowing them up with the antiquities. ISIL has yet to tell locals the identities of the three individuals or say why they had been killed. (BBC) (USA Today)Thousands gather in Ankara to pay their respects to those killed in Saturday's peace rally bombings. Marches and sit-ins protesting the attack were also held in Istanbul. No group has claimed responsibility. Turkeyâ€™s already polarized political parties traded accusations of responsibility for the attack. National elections are still scheduled for November 1, 2015.
