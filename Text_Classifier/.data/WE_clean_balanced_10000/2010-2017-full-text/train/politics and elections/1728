Aboriginal MP 'disappointed' by slurs
INDIGENOUS Australians must take matters into their own hands if they want to see more Aborigines in Parliament, according to the first Aborigine to win a seat in the House of Representatives.
Ken Wyatt claimed victory in the marginal West Australian seat of Hasluck yesterday, amid revelations he was subjected to racist taunts during the election campaign.
Mr Wyatt said the taunts had come in the form of phone calls to his campaign office, as verbal taunts on the streets and as messages on news websites.
He said they had come from both white and Aboriginal people, some accusing him of selling out his cultural heritage by joining the Liberal Party.
Mr Wyatt, who has Aboriginal, Indian and English blood, said he was disappointed by the taunts but not deterred.
''There will be people who have differences of opinion, which I don't mind in terms of a political difference, but when it gets down to some very pointed comments on some of the websites, that hurts because it means others are also reading those and feeling equal pain because they thought things had moved on,'' he said.
