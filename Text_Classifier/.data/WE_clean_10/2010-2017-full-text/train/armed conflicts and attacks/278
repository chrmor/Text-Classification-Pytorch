Funeral held for Palestinian shot by Israeli soldiers
The funeral of a Palestinian man shot dead by Israeli soldiers has taken place in the West Bank.
Mahmoud Titi, 22, was killed during clashes in a refugee camp near Hebron on Tuesday, after soldiers entered the camp to make arrests.
Palestinian doctors said he was shot in the head with a live round.
Mr Titi's death follows a recent rise in violence across the West Bank, with frequent clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters.
The Israeli military said its soldiers entered the al-Fawwar refugee camp, south of Hebron, after Palestinians threw a petrol bomb onto a road towards Israeli cars. Clashes then broke out, during which Mr Titi was killed, it added.
The military confirmed that live ammunition was used during the operation. Two other Palestinians were injured during the incident.
The BBC's Jon Donnison in Jerusalem says there has been an increase in tension in the West Bank in recent weeks, with frequent clashes between Israeli soldiers and protesters angry at treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Some prisoners have also been on hunger strike in protest at their treatment.
At the end of 2012 there were more than 4,500 Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons, with 178 placed in administrative detention - a controversial practice whereby people can be held without charge or trial. Israel says many of the prisoners are suspected of being members of militant Palestinian groups.
The United Nations says Mr Titi is the sixth Palestinian to be killed by Israeli army fire since the beginning of the year.
His death comes a week before US President Barack Obama is due to visit Israel and the West Bank, but with little optimism of a resumption of the Middle East peace talks which collapsed in 2010, our correspondent adds.
