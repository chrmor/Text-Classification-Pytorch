KUNA : Arab League calls on Syria to stop violence, security raids
CAIRO, Aug 7 (KUNA) -- Arab League Secretary General Nabil Al-Arabi called Sunday on Syrian authorities to put a stop to its acts of violence and security raids on its own people, and to take necessary measures to maintain national unity and protect civilians. "There is still an opportunity for President Bashar Al-Assad to respond to the will of the Syrian people and their legitimate demands of freedom, change and political reform," Al-Arabi said in a press statement. The Arab League chief expressed increasing anxiety and extreme disdain at the collapse of security in Syria as a result of the heightened military operations and violence in Hama, Deir Al-Zour and other parts of the country, which have led to the death of dozens of civilians and the destruction of many publically and privately-owned buildings. "The Arab League charter rejects foreign interference in Arab affairs, and ensures the safety and security, and political stability of its member countries," he stressed. He also urged Syrian authorities to work towards a comprehensive national dialogue, noting the Arab League keenness to support such a task. "This is the only solution, which outlines a peaceful transition to a stage of stability that paves the way for a program of political reform," he added. Al-Arabi also called on the Syrian government to form an independent legal team, to investigate the violent happenings and "breaches of human rights". (end) mfm.sd KUNA 071755 Aug 11NNNN
