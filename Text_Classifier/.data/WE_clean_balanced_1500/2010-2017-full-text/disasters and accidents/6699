Argentina flooding kills three, leads to thousands evacuating homes
Flooding across much of Argentina, which burst riverbanks and deluged city streets, killed three people and led more than 11,000 people to evacuate their homes, authorities said.
"There are 11,000 people who were evacuated by authorities or evacuated on their own," public safety chief Sergio Berni said on C5N television.
The national weather service said more rain was in the forecast but not as heavy as in recent days, which have seen record downfall in very short periods of time.
The downpours have burst banks in major rivers such as the Lujan, the Areco and the Arrecifes.
Many parts of the fertile pampas region — where the country's key crops are grown and livestock is raised — were under water.
About 1,000 people fled rising waters in the city of Salto alone.
