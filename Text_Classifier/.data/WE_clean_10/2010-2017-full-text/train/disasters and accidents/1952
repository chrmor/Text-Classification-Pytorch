Brazil presidential candidate Campos in plane crash
SAO PAULO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - A private jet carrying candidate Eduardo Campos, who is running third in polls ahead of Brazil's October presidential election, crashed on Wednesday in the city of Santos, according to a source in Campos's political party.
The plane, a Cessna 560XL, lost contact with air traffic control as it was preparing to land, according to an Air Force statement. Television images showed smoke billowing from the crash site in a residential area of Santos.
A police official in Santos said there were "certainly" fatalities in the crash, but could not say how many or provide any additional information.
Campos, 49, is a former governor of northeastern Pernambuco state who had the support of about 10 percent of voters in recent polls. He has positioned himself as a business-friendly leftist and was a former ally of President Dilma Rousseff, who is seeking a second term.
The Brazilian Socialist Party source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Campos' running mate, Marina Silva, was not on board the plane. (Reporting by Brazil newsroom, writing by Brian Winter; editing by Todd Benson, G Crosse)
