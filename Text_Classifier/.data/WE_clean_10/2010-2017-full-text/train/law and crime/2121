In pictures: Guatemala mourns Argentina's Cabral
Guatemalans held a tribute concert on Sunday for Argentine folk singer Facundo Cabral, shot dead when his car was ambushed on his way to the airport in Guatemala City the day before.
Fans turned out in the rain to remember Cabral, who became famous in Latin America in the 1970s as a protest singer.
The killing of Cabal, who was reportedly not the target of the attack, has shocked Guatemalans, long used to their nation's high murder rate. A Guatemalan flag with red stains symbolizing Cabral's blood was flying at half mast in Guatemala City.
People gathered to protest at his murder, with many saying it cast shame on Guatemala.
Fans also gathered outside the heavily guarded funeral home where Cabral's remains were taken before being repatriated to Argentina.
Guatamalan President Alvaro Colom (right) promised a thorough investigation and declared three days of mourning.
Cabral, 74, had performed his last concert on Thursday in Quetzaltenango. His most famous song No Soy de Aqui ni Alla (I'm Not From Here Nor There) was recorded in several languages.
