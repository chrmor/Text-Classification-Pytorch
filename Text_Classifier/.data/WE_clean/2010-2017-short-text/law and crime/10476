News International phone hacking scandal: The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee publishes its report into phone hacking at the News of the World. The committee concludes that Rupert Murdoch "is not a fit person" to run a major international company and exhibited "wilful blindness" to phone-hacking and other practices going on in his media empire. The report also accuses three News Corporation executives of giving misleading evidence. (BBC) (Al Jazeera)
