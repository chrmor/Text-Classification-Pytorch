Orlando tragedy: Two officers remembered
(CNN)One officer was a mother known for working with youth in the Orlando community.
The other was a hulking former college football player known as "Big Norm."
On Monday morning, Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot to death. A few hours later, Norman Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in an vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's assailant.
The deaths are a double tragedy for a community still recovering from the Pulse nightclub shooting that left 49 dead in June.
"To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.
A candlelight vigil in their memory was held Tuesday evening in the Walmart parking lot where Clayton was killed. At police headquarters, Clayton's patrol vehicle was parked in front, next to a memorial wreath.
She grew up in the Orlando area and had worked 17 years for the police department, police Chief John Mina said.
"It was her passion," he said. "She wanted to be a police officer so she could do good and get bad people off the streets."
"She did so many different projects in the community.," he said. "She organized several marches against violence by herself."
the city website said. Clayton was involved in Operation Positive Direction, he said. That's a youth mentoring program that helps middle and high school students "who face social, economic and academic challenges in an effort to set them on successful paths for their future," the city website said.
"She personally traveled and mentored kids in this area and went on trips to Washington, D.C., and other parts of the country," Mina said.
Lewis was killed in an auto accident about 2Â½ hours after Clayton was shot. As a massive manhunt for the shooting suspect was underway, Lewis was driving a motorcycle when a motorist turned in front of him, Demings said.
CNN affiliate WFTV Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department, mostly in the traffic division. He also graduated from the University of Central Florida, playing in the offensive line on the school football team from 2000-2003 and graduating in 2004 with a degree in criminal justice, CNN affiliate WFTV reported.
"'Big Norm' was known as much for his infectious ear-to-ear smile as he was his 6-foot-3, nearly 300-pound towering frame," Sandor said. "His smile and laugh took over any room he was in."
"I'll miss our time goofing off in court during recesses," Sandor said. "He always made long breaks fly by. However, what I will miss the most is my friend and a man who I knew was always ready to protect this entire community."
"He did his job every day and I think the public needs to know whether it's doing mundane (tasks) or looking for the worst person possible, we are out there doing our jobs, and that's what he was doing," Montes said.
GoFundMe GoFundMe account has been set up for Lewis' family. His funeral is scheduled for Friday morning at First Baptist Church in Orlando.
