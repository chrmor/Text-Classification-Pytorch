Japan crisis unlikely to be another Chernobyl-IAEA
VIENNA, March 14 (Reuters) - The nuclear crisis in Japan is unlikely to turn into another Chernobyl, the world’s worst nuclear accident, the head of the United Nations atomic watchdog said on Monday.
It is “unlikely that the accident would develop” like Chernobyl, Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told a news conference, noting several differences, including the design and structure of the nuclear plants.
