Tiger Woods loses No. 1 spot to Adam Scott in Official World Golf Ranking
Adam Scott didn't play this weekend, but he still collected another milestone without taking a swing.
While his PGA Tour colleagues teed it up at the Byron Nelson Championship at TPC Four Seasons in Irving, Texas, Scott sat poised to take over the No. 1 spot on the Official World Golf Ranking from Tiger Woods when the updated list is released on Monday morning.
"I hope I'm keeping myself in a similar kind of position for awhile," said Scott at the Players Championship. "But I haven't really thought about it too much. I'm really just into the process of trying to get my game better all the time. Pretty much wins takes care of all the rankings and all the questions."
The 33-year-old Scott is the 17th player -- and only the second Australian -- to wear the crown. Greg Norman lost his No. 1 ranking in 1998.
Scott has yet to win on Tour this year, his best finish coming at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he closed with a 76 to take third. He and the rest of the top five -- Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar -- all had chances to ascend to No. 1 with a strong finishes at the Players last week, but they all failed to crack the top 10 at TPC Sawgrass.
Woods has spent 683 weeks at No. 1 in his career, including the last 60, but he has been steadily losing points as he recovers from a March 31 surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his back. Woods has said he expects to make a "summer return," but has yet to announce when he will play in his next event.
When he does, Scott could find that keeping the No. 1 ranking might not be as easy as reaching it.
