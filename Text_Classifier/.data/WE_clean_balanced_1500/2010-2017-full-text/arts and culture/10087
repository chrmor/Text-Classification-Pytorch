New Che Guevara diary published
Diary of a Combatant covers revolutionary's arrival in Cuba in 1956 with Fidel and Raúl Castro through to late 1958
A previously unpublished diary kept by Ernesto "Che" Guevara during the guerilla campaign he fought alongside Fidel Castro has been released in Cuba.
Diary of a Combatant covers the period from 1956 until late 1958, beginning with Guevara's arrival in Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with Fidel and Raúl Castro and going on to cover his march from the east of the island to Havana.
The book was unveiled in the Cuban capital on Tuesday on what would have been the Argentine-born revolutionary's 83rd birthday. His widow, Aleida March, was on hand with one of his daughters to sign copies and said that the purpose of publishing the diary was "to acknowledge his thoughts, life and work".
The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies centre, which is directed by March, and published by Australian firm Ocean Press/Ocean Sur.
One reason why the publication of the diaries had been put off was that some of the hand-written notebooks in which they were kept were missing, a press conference was told.
"Where are the notebooks? We don't know, and there are a lot of different versions," said Maria del Carmen Ariet, a researcher from the Che Guevara Studies centre, according to CNN.
However, she added that much of the material was included in Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War, another account of Guevara's time in Cuba's Sierra Maestra mountains, which was published in 1963.
"We'd have to ask if he really wanted Diary of a Combatant published," she said.
Guevara was killed in Bolivia in 1967 after arriving there in 1966 as part of a plan to spark a revolution.
