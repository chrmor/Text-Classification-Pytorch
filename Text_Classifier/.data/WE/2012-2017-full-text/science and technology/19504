Season's first human case of West Nile virus confirmed in NYC
Officials have found the season’s first human case of West Nile virus in the city, the Health Department said Monday.
A Brooklyn man diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can be caused by the mosquito-borne virus, has tested positive for West Nile, officials said.
“This season’s first case of West Nile virus is a reminder to protect ourselves against mosquito bites,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett.
The man was over 40 and had other underlying medical conditions, officials said.
The city has done nine rounds of pesticide spraying and seven aerial larvicide treatments to go after mosquitos this season. While the focus has been on preventing the Zika virus, the anti-mosquito tactics also reduce the risk of West Nile.
Zika has not been found in any mosquitos in New York.
Some 318 New Yorkers have been diagnosed with West Nile virus since it was first found in the United States in 1999.
People over 60 are particularly at risk for the virus, which causes flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all in most people but can lead to a serious and sometimes fatal infection of the brain and spinal cord.

“Wearing mosquito repellent when you are outdoors, getting rid of standing water, and installing window screens will reduce your risk of getting bitten. New Yorkers age 60 and older or people with weakened immune systems should be especially careful as they are more likely to become seriously ill, and in rare cases die, if infected,” Bassett said.
