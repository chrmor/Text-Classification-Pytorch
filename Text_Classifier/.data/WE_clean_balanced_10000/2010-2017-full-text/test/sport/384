Spain learn fate in U21 qualifying draw
Austria, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania lie in wait for 2011 winners Spain following the 2013â€“15 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying draw in Nyon today.
Looking to retain their title in Israel this summer, Spain will not have an easy ride in Group 4 of qualifying for the next competition, which will conclude with a final tournament in the Czech Republic in June 2015. Winners in 2009, Germany also have a tough task ahead in Group 6, where they have been pitted against Romania, Montenegro, the Republic of Ireland and the Faroe Islands. Neighbours Greece and Turkey, meanwhile, will meet in Group 7, while Group 8 is the only section to feature two sides who will compete in this summer's finals: hosts Israel and Norway.
Group stage matches can get under way from 22 March, as the contestants bid to join hosts the Czech Republic in the finals. The ten group winners and the four best runners-up will advance to the play-offs to determine the seven sides destined for the showpiece event.
