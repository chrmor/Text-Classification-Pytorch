South Korea suspends North Korea flood aid
South Korea is suspending shipments of flood aid to North Korea as of Wednesday following the North's deadly shelling of a border island, Seoul's unification ministry says.
The South in September promised a 10 billion won ($A8.55 million) aid package including rice, instant noodles, cement and other emergency supplies, after its neighbour was hit by severe floods in August.
The aid was delivered in the name of the Red Cross and other private organisations but was partly financed by the Seoul government.
Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-Sung said 5000 tonnes of rice, three million packs of instant noodles and 3000 tonnes of cement have already been sent.
But 7000 tonnes of cement would be blocked along with medical supplies worth 580 million won, he said.
The rice shipment was the first government-financed rice aid to the North since a conservative South Korean government took office in early 2008.
Tuesday's attack, which killed two marines and injured 15 more along with three civilians, sparked outrage in the South.
