Israel: Rockets fired from Gaza violate cease-fire
Earlier, negotiators in Cairo had been scrambling to extend the Gaza cease-fire, which was set to expire at 8 a.m. Friday (1 a.m. ET). A Hamas official had told supporters in Gaza City that the group was ready to resume fighting if it didn't win key concessions in the talks.
"There is no decision to undermine the talks, there is no decision to go back to fight," he said. "But we have to evaluate what the Israelis are doing, what the Israelis are saying."
Hamas, meanwhile, says the blockade must end before a lasting peace deal can be reached. Israel must also stop activities in response to the kidnapping of three Israeli teens who were later found dead and facilitate reconstruction of the territory's devastated infrastructure, Hamdan told CNN.
"If you want cement for building homes or schools, you've got to make sure the cement goes there and not rebuilding attack tunnels that go into Israel," he said.
"We're of course concerned if something like that occurs, that the Iranians or others will bring missile boats into the Mediterranean and to that Gaza port," Gold said. "So it's not so simple as to say, 'Give them a port.' "
"We don't know the circumstances of this particular rocket launcher," he told CNN. "And if there has been incidents in which fighters from Palestinian factions fired at Israel from civilian populated centers, I think they were isolated centers. But to portray that this was the rule and not the exception is not a fair representation of what is happening in Gaza."
