EGYPT: Israeli president calls President Mubarak a peacemaker
“In spite of all the attacks against President Mubarak, I know him for many years, throughout his presidency, and I accredit him as one of the persons who saved many lives by preventing war in the Middle East, who saved lives of Egyptians, of Arabs, of Israelis, by not allowing to renew a war," Peres said at the EFI Policy Conference in Jerusalem.
He said Mubarak's contribution to peace would never be forgotten.
