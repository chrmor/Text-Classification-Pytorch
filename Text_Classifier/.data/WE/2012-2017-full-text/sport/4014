River Plate appoint Ramon Diaz coach
Argentine giants River Plate have confirmed Ramon Diaz will replace the sacked Matias Almeyda as manager.
Diaz was at the helm of the club during the 1990s, when he won five league titles, the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana. The 53-year-old is considered a River Plate great, having also played for the club from 1978-1981.
Almeyda was axed on the weekend after a poor run of form which included just one win in their past seven outings left them languishing in ninth position. Club chief Daniel Passarella then met with Diaz on Thursday and immediately offered him a deal which will see him take over for this Sunday's clash with Lanus.
It is reported in the Argentine press that Diaz will be officially unveiled to the media in his new position on Friday.
