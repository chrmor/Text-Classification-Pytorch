NHL Draft 2015: Live Results, Picks and Grades for Round 1
Hockey fans saw slam dunks and plenty of surprises during the first round of the 2015 NHL draft on Friday in Sunrise, Florida.
As expected, top centers Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel were the first two players chosen, with McDavid going to the Edmonton Oilers after they won the draft lottery. Eichel will join the Buffalo Sabres.
Moving further down the board, we saw a few surprises.
Most notably, the Boston Bruins stockpiled three consecutive mid-round selections thanks to the trades of Dougie Hamilton and Milan Lucic earlier in the day, then used those picks to choose Jakub Zboril, Jake DeBrusk and Zachary Senyshyn.
The New York Islanders' Garth Snow was a busy general managerâ€”coming into the day without a first-round pick but acquiring two picks through trades in order to choose centers Mathew Barzal and Travis Konecny.
Some well-regarded players were left sitting in the stands at the end of Friday's first-round action. We'll find out on Saturday where prospects like Jansen Harkins, Jeremy Roy and Oliver Kylington ultimately touch down.
Day 2 of the draft gets underway at 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, with television coverage on the NHL Network.
