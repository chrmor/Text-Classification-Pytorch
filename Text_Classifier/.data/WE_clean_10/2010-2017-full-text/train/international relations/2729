Israel admits abducting Gaza engineer
TEL AVIV (Ma'an) -- Israeli media released details on the abduction of Gaza engineer Dirar Abu Sisi on Sunday, after the country partially lifted its gag order on the plight of the power plant official who went missing in the Ukraine in February.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said only that "Sisi was arrested by Israel as part of an investigation. Much of the rest of the details remain under gag order."
Earlier in March, an Israeli court in Petah Tikva upheld a ban on publishing any information from Israel about the mysterious disappearance of Abu Sisi on February 19, when he boarded a train in the Ukraine during a visit to his wife's family. Relatives said he was seeking to establish Ukrainian citizenship during the trip.
Two weeks ago, the Ukrainian interior ministry said it had received a request from Abu Sisi's wife "to establish the whereabouts of her husband who disappeared in unknown circumstances," spokesman Sergiy Burlakov said.
Burlakov said Abu Sisi was reported to have disappeared on a train between Kiev and the northern city of Kharkiv and that his wife said he could be in Israel.
