Plane with 18 people missing in Nepal's mountains
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) â€” A Nepal Airlines plane with 18 people on board flying in bad weather is missing in Nepal's mountainous west.
Ram Hari Sharma of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the plane left Sunday from the resort town of Pokhara after making an unscheduled fuel stop, but that contact was lost a few minutes later.
The Twin Otter plane had 15 passengers and three crew members on board and was heading toward the town of Jumla.
It has been snowing this weekend in parts of the mountainous region, and visibility has been low due to fog.
A rescue helicopter was trying to reach the area where contact with the plane was lost, but the weather conditions were making it difficult.
