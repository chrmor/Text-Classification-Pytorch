Ukraine opposition leader injured in clash with police
Kiev has become a hub of protests since November, when Yanukovich declined to sign the integration agreement with the European Union, choosing a closer reintegration with Russia instead. At the end of December, Russian President granted a $15-billion loan to Ukraine and presided with Yanukovich over a deal cutting the price of Russian natural gas exported to Ukraine by more than one-third, a move that somewhat toned down the protests but failed to stop them.
