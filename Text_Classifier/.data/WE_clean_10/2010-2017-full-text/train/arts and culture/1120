At 9/11 Museum Dedication, Remembrance and Resilience
In a vast underground hall beside twisted and graffiti-adorned steel remnants of New York’s twin towers, President Obama and other dignitaries joined rescue workers and families of Sept. 11 victims Thursday to dedicate the new National September 11 Memorial Museum.
Flags outside were at half-staff on the World Trade Center memorial plaza, where bronze panels bear the engraved names of the nearly 3,000 people who were killed in New York, Northern Virginia and Pennsylvania in 2001, and in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
About 700 guests attended the somber ceremony held in the museum’s Foundation Hall, 70 feet beneath ground level at bedrock. As some audience members wiped tears from their faces, or held on to family members, elected officials, survivors and rescue workers rose one by one to talk about the victims and what was left behind.
“No act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country,” President Obama told the crowd during the one-hour dedication ceremony. “Like the great wall and bedrock that embrace us today,” he added, “nothing can ever break us.”
