Pirates Seize German Ship Beluga Nomination Off Somalia Coast
Pirates off the coast of Somalia captured a German vessel with 12 men on board belonging to the fleet of Bremen-based Beluga Shipping GmbH.
The Beluga Nomination was travelling from Malta to the port of Masan, South Korea, when it was seized on Jan. 22 some 800 nautical miles north of the Seychelles, Beluga Shipping said in an e-mailed statement today. The crew of the ship, a “multi-purpose heavy-lift project carrier,” comes from Poland, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, the company said.
Pirates hijacked a record 53 ships and 1,181 crew members in 2010, most of them off Somalia, according to the London-based International Maritime Bureau. Somalia has lacked an operating government since 1991, and parts of its coast have become home to the world’s most active pirate groups. While distress calls were made by the crew to the European anti-pirate mission Atalanta, no warships were in the area at the time, Beluga said.
The ship “is in severe distress and danger,” said Beluga, which offers services to the offshore oil and gas industry and to sea-based wind-energy projects.
The crew was able to flee to a security room within the ship when the pirates attacked. Their captors eventually managed to break into the room and take control of the ship, which is now sailing toward Somalia, Beluga said.
