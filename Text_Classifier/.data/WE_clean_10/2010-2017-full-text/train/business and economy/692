Espírito Santo International Files for Creditor Protection
LISBON—Portuguese conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA filed for creditor protection in a Luxembourg court, saying it is unable to meet its debt obligations.
The filing comes as prosecutors in Portugal disclosed Friday that they are investigating issues related to Espírito Santo and its entities, as the central bank moved to calm fears about one of the company's partly owned units, lender Banco Espírito Santo SA, Portugal's second-largest lender by assets.
