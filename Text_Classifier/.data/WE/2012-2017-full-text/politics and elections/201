SYDNEY—A media adviser to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard resigned Friday amid a controversy surrounding leaked information that led to a chaotic confrontation with Aboriginal activists and the premier's emergency rescue by police.
But while Ms. Gillard lost an aide, she recovered a shoe that had slipped off during the rescue—a dark blue wedge that became a rallying point for the protesters seeking to reawaken the issue of indigenous rights in the country.
