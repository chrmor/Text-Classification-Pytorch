Australian dollar hits fresh post-float high
SYDNEY (MarketWatch) -- The Australian dollar jumped to a fresh post-float high of $1.0316 on Wednesday before falling back to $1.0307. That was the highest level for the currency since it was allowed to float freely in 1983. The currency rose to a high of $1.0314 on Monday, which analysts attributed to companies shifting capital back to the country following devastating floods early in the year. On Wednesday, currency strategists at Forex.com said that they believe broad risk appetite is driving the Australian dollar higher and that if the S&P 500 index heads toward 1,335 then the Australian dollar may hit $1.0400.
