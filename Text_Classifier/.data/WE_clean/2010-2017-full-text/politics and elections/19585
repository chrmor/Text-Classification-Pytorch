Republicans Retain House Majority and Projected for Historic Gains
Republicans will retain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives for the final two years of President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration.
NBC News projects the GOP will hold a 250-185 seat advantage, with the probability of error plus or minus four seats.
Republicans rode a GOP wave into control of the House in the 2010 elections and have held the majority ever since. House Republicans have been the beneficiaries of redistricting gains made after 2010 and continue to retain control despite facing some headwinds. Early exit polls conducted Tuesday showed that 79 percent of voters disapprove of the job Congress is doing and they have clashed repeatedly with President Barack Obama over the past four years.
Republicans entered Tuesday with a chance to gain 13 seats, which would give them their largest advantage since 1928.
