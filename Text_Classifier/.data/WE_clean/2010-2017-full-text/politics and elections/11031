Protesters Defy Efforts to Muffle Anti-Putin Outcry
“It means that we were not afraid of the tough actions of the powers and the police,” said Dmitry G. Gudkov, a member of Parliament and a leader of the opposition, adding that the government could achieve more through negotiation. “We need dialogue with the authorities, and we need to pursue political reforms, constitutional reforms and the reform of the judicial system. It is the only way out of this political crisis in Russia — the only way out.”
Mr. Gudkov said it was silly for the authorities to issue summonses to prevent some opposition leaders from attending. “Everyone is a leader here, and we can change speakers,” he said. “It’s the people’s protest, and I think Putin and the government need to realize it.”
Among those forced to skip the rally and instead face questioning by the authorities was the blogger and anticorruption activist Aleksei Navalny. But far from being silenced, Mr. Navalny posted a series of messages on Twitter mocking his interrogators.
“I am still in questioning,” Mr. Navalny wrote at one point. “They are asking about the Anti-Corruption Fund, who works for it, what they do — surely they want to be employed by us.”
At another point, he wrote: “They just asked, ‘How have you been employed since Jan. 1 2005?’ It seems I have been planning unrest for a long time.”
Some in the crowd also mocked the authorities. “Do you want a ticket to the paddy wagon?” cried one young man, carrying a roll of fake bus tickets. “Step up for a ticket to the paddy wagon!”
The police tightly penned in the march and rally site, a roughly mile-and-a-half stretch using barricades, trucks and other heavy equipment. But the overall police presence, while still large, seemed lighter than at previous protests. Officers, some dressed in camouflage, for the most part did not engage with the crowd. Some demonstrators tried to spin this as a public relations victory. “The police are with the people!” they shouted.
While that seemed wishful thinking, there was none of the violence that marred the last big protest, which occurred on May 6, the day before Mr. Putin’s inauguration to a third term as president.
So far, the authorities have arrested more than a dozen people on various charges related to the May 6 unrest, and the criminal inquiry is still under way. It was that investigation that led to the searches of opposition leaders’ homes and their being summoned for questioning.
Most complied. Mr. Navalny, the television star Kseniya Sobchak and the liberal organizer Ilya Yashin all reported to the Investigative Committee for questioning at 11 a.m., waving cheerfully to photographers on their way in.
But the leftist Sergei Udaltsov defied the summons and went to the march. Instead, his lawyer delivered a statement explaining that as an official organizer of the demonstration, Mr. Udaltsov would have been irresponsible not to attend.
Mr. Yashin, who went to the rally straight from being questioned, said he had thanked his interrogators for promoting the march. “I told them that no one had done so much for the success of our demonstration,” he said, to cheers from the crowd. “We have no better helpers than these criminal people who are carrying out senseless, idiotic repressions.”
Once again, the huge crowd of antigovernment protesters represented a panoramic range of political views, and in some cases the demonstrators seemed barely united by their opposition to Mr. Putin.
The crowd, for instance, included many Russian nationalists dressed in black and flying black, yellow and white flags, and one column unfurled a huge banner reading, “We’ll take back Russia for the Russians.” Groups of liberals passed by wearing their own symbol — the white ribbon — with some murmuring, “How awful.”
Aleksei Kovalyov, one of the nationalists, expressed disdain for many of the liberal leaders of the demonstrations.
“The only reason we’re here is because we are going to unite the Russian people against the government,” Mr. Kovalyov said. “They won’t be able to put us down like in Libya or Syria because every Russian knows something about total war in his soul.”
Roman Habarov, a former police officer from Voronezh who spoke at the rally, got a warm reception from the crowd. “Police officers are ready to defend the law but not the crooks who are currently dictating how it should be carried out,” Mr. Habarov said. “All that remains for us is lawful but decisive protest.”
The protest coincided with a holiday, Russia Day, which commemorates Russia’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, and as a result city streets were largely empty except for the demonstrators.
Dark storm clouds gathered all morning, and shortly before the scheduled start, the skies opened with a tremendous downpour.
Meanwhile, the Web site of the Dozhd television station, which has given comprehensive coverage to the opposition marches, was paralyzed by a hacker attack, its editor in chief told the Interfax news agency.
In an interview with Dozhd, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, praised the work of the police who supervised Tuesday’s rally, calling it “civil, courteous, benevolent.” and the participants in the rally, saying they were “very disciplined.” Mr. Peskov added, “Political culture is strengthening.”
Ivan A. Mefenko, 25, the director of an Internet cafe, said he had not been sure whether to attend the rally until the raids that took place on Monday, which were documented virtually minute by minute via Twitter and Internet news sites. “We’re hoping they will start to listen, at last, to the opinions of the people,” he said.
Galina Petrenko, 49, who works in the cosmetics industry, said the government was miscalculating by taking punitive steps against the protesters. “They will simply speed up this wave coming toward them,” she said. “You should not take actions against your own people.”
But in many ways the huge, peaceful rally left more questions than answers. Where will the arrests, searches and other government pressure lead? Will protesters at the next rally face arrest and the stiff penalties included in the new law?
One demonstrator’s sign seemed to capture the moment. It asked, “And, what to do?”
