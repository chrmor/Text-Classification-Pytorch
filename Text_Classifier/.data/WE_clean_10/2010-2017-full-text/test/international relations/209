WTO rules against Australia on NZ apple imports
The World Trade Organisation has ordered Australia to change restrictions on New Zealand apple imports after it found they are illicit.
A ruling by WTO's panel of independent arbitrators says "the dispute settlement body request Australia to bring inconsistent measures... into conformity with its obligations."
Australia banned New Zealand apple imports in the 1920s, claiming there was a risk of spreading the fire blight apple tree disease.
The Australian government lifted the ban in 2006 but imposed strict conditions that New Zealand said made its exports uneconomic.
New Zealand claims the disease cannot be spread through clean mature apples, and in 2007 it asked the WTO to settle the dispute.
The WTO panel upheld New Zealand's arguments, challenging the validity of the scientific and risk assessments invoked by Australia.
Under the WTO's plant and human health rules, any restrictions on trade must be based on a proper assessment of the risks, using internationally recognised methods, as well as "relevant" scientific evidence.
New Zealand growers have estimated that exports of apples to Australia could be worth NZ$50 million (A$40 million) dollars a year.
