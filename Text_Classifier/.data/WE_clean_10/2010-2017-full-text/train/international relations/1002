HWACHEON, South Korea, July 7 (Yonhap) -- South Korea was to break ground Thursday for a new facility to accommodate a growing number of North Korean defectors seeking a new life in the South, officials said. The move underscores the continued stream of North Koreans who undergo the risky journey to South Korea to avoid chronic food shortages and harsh political oppression despite fierce crackdowns on North Korean refugees by Pyongyang and Beijing.
