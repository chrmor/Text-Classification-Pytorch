Anti-government protests in Yemen and Algiers broken up
Government supporters in Yemen have broken up a pro-democracy march inspired by the Egyptian uprising.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh has already promised to step down when his term ends in 2013.
As well as sporadic protests and chronic poverty, Yemen has a secessionist movement in the south, a shaky ceasefire with Shi'ite rebels in the north and a resurgent al Qaeda presence.
Riot police in Algiers dispersed thousands of people who had defied a government ban to demand that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika step down.
The BBC reports it is estimated that 30,000 riot police were deployed across the city on Saturday.
Armoured vehicles were placed at strategic points across the city, with water cannons on standby and a helicopter circling above the centre of Algiers.
Public demonstrations have been banned in Algeria under a state of emergency in place since 1992.
