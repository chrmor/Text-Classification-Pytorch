Adam Johnson arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with girl, 15
England and Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson has been arrested on suspicion of having sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.
Durham Police said the 27-year-old was questioned at a station close to his County Durham home and later bailed.
Sunderland AFC said the player had been suspended pending the outcome of the police investigation.
The arrest of a Premier League footballer was revealed earlier in The Sun newspaper.
The Sunderland-born winger joined Middlesbrough's youth academy and made his senior debut at the age of 17, in a 2005 Uefa Cup game.
He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, returned to Middlesbrough and then in 2010 made a £7m move to Manchester City.
In 2012 he signed for Sunderland on a £10m deal, and was handed the Barclays Player of the Month award in January 2014 after scoring a hat-trick in an away win against Fulham.
He has also represented England at under-19 and under-21 levels, and at senior level 12 times. His last England appearance was in a friendly win over Italy in August 2012.
His arrest came shortly before he was due to travel with Sunderland to Hull for Tuesday night's Premier League fixture.
Sunderland said it would make no further comment on the arrest.
