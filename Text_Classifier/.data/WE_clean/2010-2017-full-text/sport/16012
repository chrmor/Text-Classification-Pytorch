10. How many times are the hands of a clock at right angle from 5 A: M to 11 P: M?
In this section, we will provide you the solutions to the above questions along with their explanation.
The clock is placed such that west is at 3, north is at 6, east is at 9 and south is at 12. So, at 9:15 the minute hand will point to West direction.
The total angle made by the minute hand during an hour is 360. If it takes 360 for an hour, it will take (40/60) * 360 = 240. The angle between the hour hand the minute hand will therefore, be somewhere between 240 - 90 = 150, as the hour hand is between 1 and 2.  The angle made by the hour hand when it moves from say 1 to 2 will be 30. That is the hour hand makes 30 during the course of an hour.
The hour hand will therefore, move (40/60) * 30 = 20.
Therefore, the net angle between the hour hand and the minute hand will be 150 - 20 = 130.
The watch gains 5 seconds in 3 minutes = 100 seconds in 1 hour.
From 7 PM to 9 PM on the same day, time passed is 14 hours.
In 14 hours, the watch would have gained 1400 seconds or 23 minutes 20 seconds.
So, when the correct time is 9 AM, the watch would show 09: 23: 20 AM
Between 12 and 1, the minute hand and hour hand are at an angle of 30 to each at around 12:06 PM and the next time they will be at angle of 30 to each other will be at 1 PM.
