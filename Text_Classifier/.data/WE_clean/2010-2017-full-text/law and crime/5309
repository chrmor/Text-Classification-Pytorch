Lubbock grand jury indicts terror suspect
LUBBOCK, TX (KCBD) - A Lubbock federal grand jury indicts Khalid Aldawsari, 20, on a single charge of Attempted Use of a Weapon of Mass Destruction.  The indictment was filed late Wednesday afternoon in Lubbock federal court. The indictment reveals no new details on the case, but rather is a simple overview of the charge against Aldawsari. 
Also on Wednesday, Judge Sam Cummings issued an order to attorneys for both the defense and the prosecution to not communicate with the news media.  Such action is typically called a "gag order." 
The case has made national news, which is referred to in court records as "an extraordinary amount of media coverage."
"The court finds that there is a substantial likelihood that extrajudicial commentary could prejudice a fair trial..."  Cummings writes in his order the court has the authority to place restrictions on jurors, lawyers and others.
Aldawsari was arrested on February 23rd, amid allegations that he had collected in his Lubbock apartment the materials necessary to make an explosive device.  His writings indicated that he wanted to blow up nuclear facilities, hydro-electric dams, and the home for former President George W. Bush.
