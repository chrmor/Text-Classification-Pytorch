A11 Elveden crash: 52 injured in coach and car crash
Nine people have been taken to hospital and 43 described as "walking wounded" after a collision between a car and a coach on the A11 in Suffolk.
The crash happened near Elveden at 13:25 BST and led to the road being shut between the A1101 and B1106.
One person in the car was critically injured and another "seriously" hurt. Police said 48 people, mostly teenagers, were on the coach.
The road was re-opened just after 20:00 BST.
Suffolk Police said it was treating the crash as a major incident.
An ambulance spokeswoman said: "Nine patients have been taken to Addenbrooke's, West Suffolk and Norfolk and Norwich hospitals and 43 patients described as walking wounded."
Diversions have been put in place while the emergency services remain at the site.
Police said five people injured on the coach had been taken to hospital with minor injuries.
The occupants of the Mercedes car were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
BBC Look East cameraman John Fairhall, who filmed the aftermath of the crash, said: "There was a single decker coach on the verge about 200 metres (218 yards) south of the war memorial.
"It had come to rest at a slight angle. Next to it were a group of schoolchildren, aged around 14 or 15 I would say.
"On the other side of the road was a small car which had had its roof removed."
Mr Fairhall described the people at the scene as "calm".
"They all seemed ok," he said. "A lot of them were on their phones, presumably telling people what was going on."
A motorist caught up in tailbacks of traffic said: "It's taken us about two and a half hours to go five miles. It's very frustrating."
