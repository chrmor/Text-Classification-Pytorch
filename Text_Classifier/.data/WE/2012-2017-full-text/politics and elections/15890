Russia Reinforces Base In Armenia
The Russian Defense Ministry has announced that more military hardware has been deployed to reinforce its air base in Armenia.
The ministry said on December 21 that a total of six attack and transport helicopters had been sent to the base near the capital, Yerevan.
It said the Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters had been transferred from a military base in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar to the air base in Erebuni, Armenia.
It follows a similar move earlier in December when Russia deployed seven helicopters to Armenia, a key regional ally of Moscow.
