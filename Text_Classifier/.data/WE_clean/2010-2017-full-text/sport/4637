Packers' Aaron Rodgers named MVP of Super Bowl XLV
ARLINGTON, Texas -- Aaron Rodgers now has one achievement Brett Favre never got: A Super Bowl MVP award.
Rodgers was honored as the most outstanding player in the Green Bay Packers' 31-25 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV on Sunday.
He connected on 24-of-39 passes for 304 yards and three TD passes without committing a turnover.
Rodgers equaled Favre in Super Bowl titles (one), and brought the Lombardi Trophy back to its legendary home, Green Bay.
Rodgers drew thunderous roars form the Cowboys Stadium crowd when he hoisted the trophy and flashed his trademark mock-wrestling belt on the midfield dais.
"This is a great group of men we put together," Rodgers said of the sixth-seeded Packers who needed to win on the regular season's final day even to earn a playoff berth.
"It's great to be able to share it with them."
