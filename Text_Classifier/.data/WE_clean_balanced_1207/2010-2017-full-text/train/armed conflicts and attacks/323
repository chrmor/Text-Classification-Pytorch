Palestinian Dies as Undercover Israelis Raid a Hospital
JERUSALEM — About two dozen men wearing bulky jackets, woolen caps, hoodies and checkered kaffiyehs barged into a hospital in the West Bank city of Hebron before dawn on Thursday, pushing what appeared to be a very pregnant woman in a wheelchair.
But they were not headed to the delivery ward.
The people caught on the hospital surveillance cameras were, in fact, undercover Israeli security officers. About 10 minutes later, the Israelis were on their way out, leaving behind a Palestinian man whom they had fatally shot in the raid and wheeling out his cousin, a wounded patient whom they had come to arrest, according to hospital officials.
The raid at al-Ahli Hospital was the latest in a string of Israeli incursions into Palestinian hospitals during the recent upsurge of violence, and proof, according to Israeli officials, that there will be no safe haven for Palestinian suspects. Hospital officials were livid.
“Hospitals are supposed to be the safest places on earth,” Jihad Shawar, the hospital director, told the official Voice of Palestine Radio. He said the relatives of the two cousins were “very angry.”
