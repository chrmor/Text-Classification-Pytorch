14 killed, 40 injured in Karachi by-election violence
KARACHI: At least 14 people were killed and 40 others injured today as violence flared up in Pakistan's commercial capital in the run-up to a tense by-election in one of the most sensitive and ethnically divided areas of the city. The violence flared up after one of the contesting parties in the by-polls the Awami National Party announced it was boycotting the election as its demand for proper security and deployment of the army had not been met by the government. Police and rescue officials said that around 13 people had been killed in incidents of firing in different parts of the city but television channels put the figure at 14 at around after midnight. They were also reports of miscreants torching vehicles and forcing shopkeepers and restaurant owners to close down their businesses. The polls for the provincial assembly seat PS-94 (Orangi town) was seen as a direct contest between the Mutthaida-e-Qaumi Movement which represents the Urdu speaking population of the city and the ANP which represents the Pasthun speaking migrants. Police and rescue officials said six persons were killed in firing incidents in Orangi and Baldia towns while another three were killed in the Garden area. Tensions escalated today when the ANP which represents the Pasthun speaking migrants announced that it would boycott tomorrow's polls as it feared widespread rigging by the MQM, which has the support of Urdu speaking population of the city. The by-polls are being held for the seat left vacant by the assassination of MQM leader, Haider Reza who was gunned down with his guard outside a mosque two months back leading to large scale riots in the city. The MQM and ANP have constantly accused each other of killing workers and since Friday night police confirmed five target killings in the city. On Friday five persons were killed in targeting killings in parts of the city.
