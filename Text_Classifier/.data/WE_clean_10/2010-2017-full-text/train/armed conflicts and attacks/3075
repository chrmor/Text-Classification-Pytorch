Opposition: Dozens killed as Syrian warplanes hit gas station
As Syrian officials have for months, the president criticized Saudi Arabia and Qatar for "providing weapons and money to terrorists to repeat the Libyan scenario," which ended with Moammar Gadhafi's death and continuing issues about security and governance. And al-Assad insisted foreign intervention would not, and should not, shape Syria's future.
In one breath, he dismissed the armed opposition -- claiming "they have no support in society" -- and in another, he said that "dialogue with the opposition is the only way to address the crisis."
Haider said for any given area, the goal is "an immediate cease-fire where I can guarantee that if the Syrian army was not attacked, they would not fire back at all." But he said that every attack and every casualty makes peace even more elusive.
"The problem is, every time there is blood shed from either side, we get delayed weeks," he said. "That's why we are very careful that, in the areas we have stability, that we maintain those areas without armed groups."
"By imposing sanctions, we are sending an important message and helping to further isolate the regime. But sanctions will only have an impact if they are carried out effectively. That is how we can make a difference," Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal said.
