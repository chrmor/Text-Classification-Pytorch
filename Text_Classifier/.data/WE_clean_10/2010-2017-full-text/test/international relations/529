Israel to Open Diplomatic Office in United Arab Emirates
RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel will open a diplomatic office in the United Arab Emirates, officials said Friday, the first time in more than a decade that there will be an official Israeli presence in the Persian Gulf.
The diplomatic mission will represent Israel at the International Renewable Energy Agency, an international organization with its headquarters outside Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
“This is not an Israeli embassy or consulate in the U.A.E.,” said Dore Gold, the director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who led the effort to open the mission. “It is an office within Irena, which is an international organization.”
The office, first reported on the website of Haaretz, the Israeli daily, is scheduled to open “soon,” according to Emmanuel Nahshon, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. The mission will be led by Rani Hatan, a veteran Israeli diplomat, according to Haaretz.
