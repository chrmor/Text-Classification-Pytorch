Free George Michael 'wants to start again'
Pop star George Michael has said he "just wants to start again" following his release from prison in Suffolk after serving a sentence for drug driving.
The 47-year-old said it was "fantastic" to be free on "a beautiful day".
"I just want to say thank you for everybody who has supported me in there," the singer told reporters outside his north London home.
Michael served half of an eight-week sentence in jail for crashing his car while under the influence of cannabis.
He was arrested in July after being found slumped at the wheel of his Land Rover in Hampstead, north London.
The singer served the initial days of his sentence in Pentonville Prison before being transferred to Highpoint Prison in Suffolk.
While serving his time in jail, Michael - real name Georgios Panayiotou - issued a statement to say he had received "no special treatment of any kind".
The star, who had a previous conviction for a similar offence, was told there was no option apart from a custodial sentence when he appeared at Highbury Magistrates Court last month.
Following his release on Monday, Michael left his home to tell reporters he was "going to try to stop running away from you guys".
"I'm coming out here on my own so that you'll realise I just want to start again," he said, adding they would "see him about".
"By the way, I've just thought of a really good idea for a song," he added. "It's going to be nothing to do with prison."
Michael first shot to fame as half of pop duo Wham! before embarking on a successful career as a solo artist.
