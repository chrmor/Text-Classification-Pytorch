Turkey strikes suspected PKK targets
Turkish warplanes carried out air strikes on suspected Kurdish militant hideouts in northern Iraq overnight, Turkey's general staff said on Sunday.
It said the strikes were carried out in the Zab and Hakurk areas and targeted caves and hideouts belonging to the “separatist terror organisation”, a term used by the government to describe the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). - Reuters
