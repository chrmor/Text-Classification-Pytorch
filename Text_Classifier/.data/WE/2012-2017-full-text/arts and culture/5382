Morrissey diagnosed with severe pneumonia
Morrissey has been diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Having already cancelled numerous dates on his US tour, the singer hopes to be in full health by Thursday night.
Earlier this year, Morrisseysuffered a bleeding ulcer. Less than six weeks later, the 53-year-old is again under observation by American doctors: this time he is in San Francisco, receiving treatment for "double pneumonia" â€“ in which inflammation spreads to both lungs.
Despite his health problems, Morrissey doesn't plan to call off any future shows. He did skip Saturday's gig in San Francisco, but still plans to appear in Mexico City on 14 March. His US tour then resumes next Monday, in Lawrence, Kansas.
Illnesses have caused numerous disruptions to Morrissey's recent tour schedule. Last October, he cancelled a US tour so he could care for his mother. After the dates had been rescheduled, three shows were then once more struck off when band members fell sick. Morrissey then missed weeks of shows owing to his ulcer; he only resumed his performances at the end of February, promptlypicking a fight with chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel.
