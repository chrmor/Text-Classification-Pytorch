CA-36: Hahn leads Huey by 8
Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn leads Craig Huey by 8 percentage points on the eve of their Southern California special House election, according to a Public Policy Polling survey taken for Daily Kos & the SEIU.
Hahn, the Democrat, takes 52 percent of the vote to Huey's 44 percent, with just 4 percent undecided. 
Despite a barrage of attacks launched from both sides, Hahn's approval rating is just 6 percentage points higher than Huey's, 48 percent to 42 percent.
President Barack Obama's approval rating of 44 percent is just 2 percentage points higher than Huey's in the traditionally blue district.
The numbers appear to reflect the developments on the ground. While Huey has overperformed in a district former Rep. Jane Harman won with 60 percent of the vote, no Republican outside his camp has expressed confidence the tea partier could pull off the upset.
Democrats have a double-digit registration advantage, and while Huey has poured nearly $800,000 of his own money into the contest, Hahn enjoyed a financial edge throughout the runoff campaign.
Another promising aspect for Hahn: Of those polled who had already voted, Huey trails by just 5 percentage points.  But when broadened to those voting on Election Day,  Hahn extends her lead by 10 percentage points.
PPP surveyed 619 likely voters July 8-10.  The margin of error is 4 percentage points.
