Nigella Lawson Should Be Considered Drug User, Not Celebrity, Defense Claims in Fraud Case
Yesterday, during Francesca's testimony, Grillo insinuated that Nigella's alleged drug use was far more widespread than the celebrity chef chose to admit (Nigella confessed to using cocaine only once during her 10-year marriage to Saatchi).
"At the beginning of 2012 there were a few episodes where she [Nigella] came down and she had white powder inside her nostril. A few times I ignored it but other times I told her and she said 'it's just makeup'. It was too white to be makeup," Francesa said (according to the Telegraph). "When she was writing a new book she said she needed to work through the night because she found it easier and she needed help to stay up all night."
Grillo also said after she saw the now-infamous choking photos of Lawson and Saatchi at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair in June, she believed the couple was fighting over Lawson's purported drug use.
"The picture which stuck in my mind was Charles picking her nose. I thought maybe he had the same problem I had, he found some remains inside her nose relating to drugs and I thought maybe if he didn't know that maybe he didn't know that she authorised all the spending."
The jury of seven men and five women has been sent home today and will begin deliberations tomorrow after a short address from the judge.
