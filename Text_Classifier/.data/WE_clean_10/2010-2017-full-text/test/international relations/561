In pictures: Michelle Obama in Africa
The US First Lady Michelle Obama has begun a tour of southern Africa with her daughters Sasha and Malia, on her second solo trip abroad since her husband became president in 2009.
The six-day visit is intended to draw attention to health and education issues, and to youth leadership. It began in South Africa, where Mrs Obama met children at a day care centre in a township of Johannesburg.
Sasha and Malia also received a warm welcome from some of the children, after dancing with them and reading them stories.
White House officials say the visit will be part of the first lady's efforts to "engage young people, especially girls and young women, at home and abroad".
Later on Tuesday, the family were given a tour of the city's Apartheid Museum, documenting South Africa's struggle to break away from racial segregation.
The family were invited to make unscheduled visit to Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president. Mr Mandela, 92, is frail and rarely makes public appearances, but spent about 20 minutes talking to Mrs Obama and her daughters.
Michelle Obama, here with Mr Mandela's wife Graca Machel, will travel to Botswana on Friday for more official visits before going on a private safari with her daughters.
