Ferry sinks in Philippines; 29 people missing
At least 29 people are missing after a ferry sank in the waters off the central Philippines in bad weather Saturday, the government's civil defense office said.
A rescue operation is ongoing off the southeast coast following the sinking of the MV Maharlika, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
The boat departed Lipata Port for Liloan Port to the south, carrying 84 people, including 26 crew, when the vessel lost steering due to big waves and strong current, the agency said. Passengers and crew abandoned the vessel and 32 survivors were rescued by a responding ship less than two hours later. Meanwhile, 23 other people were also rescued by two additional vessels.
The Philippine Coast Guard and the Emergency Response Services of Surigao City are leading search and rescue operations, the NDRRMC said.
