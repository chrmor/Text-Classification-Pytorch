Thiago Silva retains the Samba Gold Trophy 2012
Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva has been voted the best Brazilian player in Europe for the second year in succession, winning the Samba Gold trophy 2012.
Thiago, who moved from AC Milan to PSG this summer, held off a strong challenge from Chelsea star Ramires to retain his crown, with Shakhtar Donetsk's Willian in a well-deserved third place.
It is the first time in the five year history of the title that an athlete has won for the second time and it is also the first time that a player based in France has won the award.
The defender recieved 17.70% of the overall vote, with Chelsea's Ramires just coming up short with 17.04% of the vote. Willian scored 10.19% overall.
Over 140,000 votes were cast, as well as those of 10 renowned journalists and 11 former Brazil internationals, with just over half of one percentage point eventually separating our winner from his nearest rival.
In February 2013, Thiago Silva will receive his award in a ceremony in Paris.
