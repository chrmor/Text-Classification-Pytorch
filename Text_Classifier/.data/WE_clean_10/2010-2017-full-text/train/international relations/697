Daily Positive (D+), an Australian online media organization encouraging positive news, has published a report listing the "top 10 most positive countries" this year.
It is an annual list compiled based on a "positivity index" comprising a global expert panel rating, a global web poll and the number of positive news entries in 2015 on the D+ website. Winners earned their places with a number of amazing positive initiatives and actions.
Switzerland, for the first time, took the crown, jumping from fourth place last year, mainly thanks to its consistent display of competitiveness in nurturing innovation and talent. It also ranks high for its democracy, peace, tourism-friendly policy and good education.
Another North European country, Sweden, comes second. It is strong in innovation and also in all the aforementioned fields. It maintains its leading position in media transparency.
China ranks third. It successfully attracted global interest to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The launching of new satellites also gave it extra marks. In addition, Tu Youyou won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the first time for an expert in Chinese traditional medicine gaining such recognition.
The following are the top 10 most positive countries in 2015.
