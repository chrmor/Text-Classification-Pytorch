Video: Alex Salmond: Scotland keeping the pound is in the UK's best interest
The SNP administration at Holyrood published its White Paper this morning, detailing how the country will be run if voters choose independence in a historic referendum to be held next September.
But the pro-independence campaign, led by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), faces an uphill battle in convincing voters to end the 300-year union.
Mr Salmond insists he has time to convince voters that an independent Scotland will be richer due to its North Sea oil reserves, but also more egalitarian and pro-European than Britain.
However, his economic case was undermined last week by a study from independent research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which predicted that even under its most optimistic assessment of independence, Scotland would have to find public spending cuts or tax rises equivalent to 1.9 percent of its GDP.
