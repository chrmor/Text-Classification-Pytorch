report praises bravery of rescuers
Customs and Border Protection personnel responded appropriately to the Christmas Island boat disaster in December, an internal review has found.
At least 30 people died when the asylum seeker boat known as SIEV 221 crashed on rocks and broke apart off Christmas Island on December 15.
Forty-two people survived but others were never found.
A Customs and Border Protection Command internal review, released today, found the organisation had no intelligence to indicate when the boat departed Indonesia or was likely to arrive at Christmas Island.
The review also found the organisation's personnel responded appropriately to the disaster.
The organisation's chief executive Michael Carmody said his personnel deserved recognition.
