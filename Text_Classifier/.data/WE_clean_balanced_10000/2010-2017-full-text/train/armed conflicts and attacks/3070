Gang shoots down police helicopter in Mexico, leaving four dead
Â A gang brought down a helicopter during a police operation in Mexico's troubled western state of Michoacan on Tuesday, killing the pilot and three officers, the governor said.
The aircraft was backing an operation to arrest leaders of criminal groups when the "official helicopter was downed" in an area with rough terrain, Governor Silvano Aureoles wrote on Twitter.
Another officer was injured in the crash.
Mr Aureoles did not say how the helicopter was shot down in the region of Apatzingan, a city located in Tierra Caliente (Hot Land), a region that has been beset by drug violence and vigilante justice for years.
"In accordance to the responsibility to protect citizens, the state and federation won't give up in the frontal fight against crime," the governor wrote.
