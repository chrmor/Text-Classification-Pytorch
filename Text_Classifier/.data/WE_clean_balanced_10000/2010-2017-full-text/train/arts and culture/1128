The Simpsons have plenty more adventures to go on.
Fox says it is renewing the subversive animated show about America's favourite TV family for a 23rd season.
The show is already the longest-running comedy on US television.
"Like many 22-year-olds, The Simpsons is extremely happy remaining at home, on Fox, and hopes it doesn't have to go out into the real world for many years to come," said executive producer Al Jean.
The outlandish tales of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have won a total of 27 Emmys since it all began in 1989.
Homer Simpson's annoyed grunt, D'oh!, has entered the Oxford English Dictionary and the family has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The renewal for another TV season will bring the total episodes for the series to 515, Fox says.
The Simpsons is broadcast in more than 100 countries and 50 languages.
