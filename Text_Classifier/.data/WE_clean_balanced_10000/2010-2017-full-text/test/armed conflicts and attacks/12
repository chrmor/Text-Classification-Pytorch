Five-year-old Syrian boy rushed to Israeli hospital
A five-year-old Syrian child was transferred Sunday to the Poriya Medical Center in Tiberias in order to undergo emergency treatment for shrapnel wounds in his hand.
The boy was injured during clashes in Syria, near the Israeli border, between rebels and forces loyal to Bashar Assad.
Forty-three Syrians have been treated at the Tiberias hospital since the beginning of the conflict, Walla reported.

Earlier this month, a 13-year-old boy moderately injured in clashes in Syria was admitted for treatment to Safed’s Ziv Hospital.
The Safed hospital has treated 238 wounded Syrians since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago. More than 130,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the bloody conflict between President Bashar Assad’s government and opposition fighters.
In Early February, Channel 2 News aired footage of a secret Israeli field hospital in the Golan Heights that has treated over 700 Syrians since the war began.
The army hospital, staffed by soldiers in uniform, includes an emergency room, an intensive care unit, an operating room, a mobile laboratory, a pharmacy and an x-ray facility. It treats Syrian patients who cross the border regardless of creed, ethnicity – or with which faction their loyalties lie.
The once-sporadic treatment of Syrian nationals in Israel has, by now, become routine, the report made clear: the wounded cross the border and IDF medical teams deployed in the Golan Heights give them preliminary treatment. Those who are well enough are sent back across the border, and those who require further treatment are evacuated to the military hospital, a field commander at the facility told Channel 2. In this way, the hospital treats about a hundred Syrians per month.
