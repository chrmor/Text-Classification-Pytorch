Dieter Hecking leaves Nurnberg to take Wolfsburg manager's job
Bundesliga strugglers Wolfsburg have named Dieter Hecking as their new head coach, with the former Germany Under-21 international leaving Nurnberg to take the reins.
Hecking, 48, replaces Lorenz-Gunther Kostner - who has been in caretaker charge of Wolfsburg since Felix Magath's resignation at the end of October.
"The new head coach of Wolfsburg is Dieter Hecking. Wolfsburg and the 48-year-old have today agreed a deal until 2016," Wolfsburg announced on their official website.
"The date for the official presentation of the new Wolves coach will be announced in the coming days.''
Wolfsburg are 15th in the Bundesliga standings on 19 points, seven above the bottom three and one behind 14th-placed Nurnberg.
Hecking took charge of Nurnberg in 2009 and helped them avoid relegation in his first season before finishing sixth and 10th respectively over the last two campaigns.
Nurnberg said on their website that they hoped to make a decision on Hecking's successor in the coming days.
