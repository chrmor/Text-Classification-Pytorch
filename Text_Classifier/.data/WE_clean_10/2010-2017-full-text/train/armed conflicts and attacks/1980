Roadside blast kills two cops in Quetta
QUETTA: A roadside bomb killed two policemen and injured eight other people on Tuesday, police and rescue officials said. 
“A bomb planted on Sariab Road went off just as a police van passed by,” Geo News quoted Superintendent Police Abdullah Afridi as saying. It was not immediately clear whether all the injured were policemen, Afridi said.
The injured were moved to Civil Hospital Quetta, where at least one of them is said to be in critical condition.
Rescue officials said two policemen were killed and five others injured in the attack that apparently targeted their van. Two passers by are said to have sustained injuries in the attack. The police suspect that the attack was carried out through a remote-controlled device.
Earlier in the day, at least three policemen were injured when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives while trying to enter Khanpur Imambargah in Shikarpur district of SIindh province as worshipers were offering Eid prayers.
Worshippers overpowered the second would-be suicide bomber as the police were reeling from their injuries inflicted in the first blast.
