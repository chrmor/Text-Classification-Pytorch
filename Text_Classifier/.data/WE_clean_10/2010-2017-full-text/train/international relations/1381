N. Korean leader Kim Jong-il visits China: source
SEOUL, May 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was visiting China Friday, a Seoul government source said, contradicting earlier reports that his heir-apparent son, Jong-un, traveled to the country.   The trip, if confirmed, will be the leader's third in slightly over one year. He had visited China in early May and late August last year.   It has yet to be confirmed whether the 69-year-old leader was accompanied on the trip by his heir-apparent son, the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.   The name of the junior Kim was not on an official list of about 70-member entourage, said the source.  (END)
