Karachi heat wave claims over 1,000 lives in Pakistan
A women sponges her husband at the emergency section of Karachi's Jinnah Post Medical Centre. There was chaos and commotion as medical personnel dealt with the patients, wiping their brows with cool, wet, slightly grimy towels. In the hospitals auditorium the chairman of the NDMA announced that the death toll of the #KarachiHeatWave has crossed 800. Dire, depressing. One waits for rain and other respites.
