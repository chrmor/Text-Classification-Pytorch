Dash Cam Captured Possible Meteor Blazing Over New Zealand
Dash cams all over New Zealand are proving to be useful after at least two cams captured an astrological incident of a lifetime.
YouTube user, Josh Sherborne from Tauranga, New Zealand was on his way to the gym when he captured a possible meteor zipping through the sky. Initially, he thought the bright light was lightning, however; the long trail of beaming light and quick zip downward towards earth might prove otherwise.
Meanwhile, in Auckland, New Zealand, another dash cam captured a similar flash of streaming light.
The Auckland Civil Defence and Emergency Management organization confirmed that the flash of light was not in fact lightning, and is most likely a meteor.
According to CDEM, there were several reports of a large flash and sonic booms across the North Island.
On the Auckland Weather Watch website, witnesses of the cosmic phenomenon were asked to share their eyewitness accounts.
"We were outside on the porch, facing west, having a break when the entire sky lit up. Like many others, apparently, we thought it was sheet lightning," read one comment.
Others describe the potential meteor has a ball of fire lighting up the sky with white and blue light as bright as daylight.
