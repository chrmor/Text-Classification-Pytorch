Gazan dies in Israeli shelling
A Palestinian man has been killed and two others injured following an Israeli tank shelling in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical sources have said.
An Israeli military spokesman told the AFP news agency that he had no reports of any Israeli army shooting in the area.
However, he added that a mortar shell had been fired from the Gaza Strip on Friday, without causing casualties or damage. Injured civilians
Medics said the injured civillians were sifting through rubble south of the Karni border crossing with Israel, looking for steel and other material to recycle.
Aged in their twenties, all three were taken to Shifa hospital in Gaza. Their identities were not immediately known.
Over the last few months, dozens of civilians have either been killed or injured by the Israeli army while collecting rubble near the border.
Israeli troops often patrol the area to prevent gunmen from infiltrating or planting explosives.
