Pedro Hernandez Gets 25 Years to Life in Murder of Etan Patz
Pedro Hernandez, a former store clerk who told the police that he murdered Etan Patz as the boy headed to school in 1979, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison on Tuesday, bringing to a close a missing-child case that bedeviled investigators for decades and forever changed the way American parents protected their children.
It took two trials, each of which lasted five months, for prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office to persuade a jury to convict Mr. Hernandez of kidnapping and murder. His first trial ended two years ago in a hung jury after one juror held out for acquittal.
On Tuesday, Etan’s parents, Stan and Julie Patz, stood and spoke inside a packed Manhattan courtroom before Mr. Hernandez was sentenced. Mr. Patz turned toward Mr. Hernandez and said: “Pedro Hernandez, after all these years, we finally know what dark secret you had locked in your heart. You took our precious child and threw him in the garbage. I will never forgive you. The God you pray to will never forgive you.”
Mr. Hernandez stared straight ahead, his face betraying no emotion. He declined to speak, but his lawyers, Harvey Fishbein and Alice L. Fontier, rose to proclaim his innocence and vowed to appeal.
