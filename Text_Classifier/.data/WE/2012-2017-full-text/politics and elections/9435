Abbott's plea to WA voters
PRIME Minister Tony Abbott has made a last-ditch plea to West Australian voters as they head to the polls for a Senate election re-run.
Before jetting out of the country to Asia on Saturday, Mr Abbott recorded a message saying Labor and the Australian Greens in the Senate were standing in the way of his government's plan to repeal the mining tax and carbon tax.
"If you want to get rid of these anti-West Australian taxes ... that means voting Liberal," Mr Abbott said.
He said coalition candidates are "absolutely committed" to scrapping the taxes and the government hoped to get the numbers in the upper house from July to pass the repeal legislation.
"Send a strong message to Canberra, send a strong message to the Labor Party," Mr Abbott said.
"You can't say one thing in Perth and do the opposite in Canberra.
The outcome of Saturday's election is important for Australia's future, the prime minister added.
