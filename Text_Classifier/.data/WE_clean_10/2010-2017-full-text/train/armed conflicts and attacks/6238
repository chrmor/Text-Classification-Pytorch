Istanbul (AFP) - Turkish warplanes struck Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq and eastern Turkey overnight, in a new air operation against the Kurdish militant group, the army said Sunday.
Turkish F-16 fighters hit 17 PKK positions in northern Iraq, destroying shelters used by the militant group, the army said on its website, listing three locations.
The army said in a separate statement that the jets had destroyed fuel and ammunition depots in Hakkari province on the border with Iraq as well as in eastern Kars province.
The strikes are the latest in an air campaign aimed at crippling the PKK, which has staged a string of attacks in Turkey since a two-year-old ceasefire fell apart in late July.
More than 150 soldiers and police have been killed in PKK bombings and shootings since the return to open conflict, compared with over 1,000 in the rebel camp, according to the government.
