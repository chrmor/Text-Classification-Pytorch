At least 3 killed in Iraq violence
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Violence in central Iraq on Sunday left at least three people dead, including two members of a group credited with helping fight the local arm of al Qaeda, officials said.
Two Sons of Iraq members were killed and two others wounded when a bomb left at their checkpoint in Samarra detonated, local police said. The group is made up of predominantly Sunni fighters who have turned on al Qaeda in Iraq and are said to be a major contributing factor in the drop in violence across the country over the past two years. Sons of Iraq has been a frequent target of bombings and assassinations.
Also in Samarra, at least four police officers were wounded when their checkpoint was also bombed, police said, and a booby-trapped bicycle wounded two civilians when it exploded along the main road between Samarra and Tikrit.
Elsewhere, gunmen shot dead the imam of a mosque in southern Baghdad's Dora district. Imam Ibrahim Mohammed was leaving evening prayers when he was killed, according to an Interior Ministry official.
Meanwhile, at least two rockets struck the International Zone formerly known as the Green Zone. There were no reports of casualties or damages in the heavily fortified area that houses the U.S. and other embassies, as well as the headquarters of the Iraqi government.
