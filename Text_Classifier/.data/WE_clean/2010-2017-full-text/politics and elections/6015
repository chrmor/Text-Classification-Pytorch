Deal to repay bank losses still splitting voters in Iceland
REYKJAVIK: Icelanders are heading to the polls today to approve or reject a renegotiated compensation deal with Britain and the Netherlands over the Icesave bank, which collapsed in 2008.
Last year 93 per cent of voters rejected a previous deal.
Negotiators have been struggling for more than two years to reach an accord on how to repay both countries the â‚¬3.9 billion ($5.3 billion) they spent compensating about 340,000 of their citizens who lost money when Icesave, an online bank, went under at the height of the global financial crisis.
The deal on offer today is considered much more favourable than a previous accord rejected in January last year.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed the two sides neck-and-neck, with 52 per cent of those who had made up their minds planning to vote ''no'' and 48 per cent set to vote ''yes''. The Gallup poll, for which 1900 people were interviewed, also indicated 15 per cent were still undecided.
Another poll published earlier on Thursday put the ''no'' voters in the lead, with 54.8 per cent of decided voters set to reject the deal, against 45.2 per cent in favour of the accord.
