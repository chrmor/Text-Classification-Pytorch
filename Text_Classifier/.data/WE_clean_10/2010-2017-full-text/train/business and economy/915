Greece on strike as bailout deal in limbo
Unions in Greece have launched a two-day general strike against planned austerity measures, a day after the country's crucial international bailout was put in limbo by its partners in the 17-nation eurozone.
Frustrated by days of dithering, bailout creditors have given Greece until the middle of next week to fully meet demands for new harsh cutbacks. Otherwise, the debt-crippled country will lose its rescue-loan lifeline, go bankrupt next month and likely leave the euro.
"We are experiencing tragic moments," Deputy Prime Minister Theodoros Pangalos told Parliament on Friday. "These days are the last acts of a drama that we all hope will lead to a happy conclusion with a voluntary reduction in our public debt and implementation of a framework by 2015 that will allow the economy to stabilise."
The Greek coalition government, led by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, had hoped some of the heat had been taken out of the crisis after leaders agreed to a raft of austerity measures they hoped would pave the way for the 130 billion euros ($A160 billion) bailout package.
However, finance ministers from the other 16 eurozone states threw a spanner in the works late on Thursday and insisted that Greece had to save an extra 325 million euros, pass the cuts through a restive parliament and guarantee in writing that they will be implemented even after planned elections in April.
The renewed hurdles in the way to the avoidance of a Greek default that could send shockwaves around the global economy dented sentiment in the markets on Friday. Stocks were down all over Europe, with the benchmark index in Athens 1.6 per cent lower by midday local time.
