Hollande beats Sarkozy in French vote, both in second round
In an outcome that could have serious implications for the eurozone crisis, Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande has won the first round of the French presidential elections.
It is the first time a serving president has been beaten in a first-round vote.
On May 6 he will face off against President Nicolas Sarkozy, who finished second among the 10 candidates, with 25.5 per cent of votes against Mr Hollande’s 28.4 per cent. Opinion polls suggest Mr Hollande could have a lead of up to 10 per cent in the final vote.
In a surprise result, exit polls announced after voting closed suggested far-right Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration National Front, had third place with 20 per cent. This was her party’s best ever showing and exceeds the historic 17 per cent her father won in a shock victory in the 2002 presidential race, when he won a place in the two-candidate second round. It appears that a drop in support for Mr Sarkozy late in the campaign benefited her.
