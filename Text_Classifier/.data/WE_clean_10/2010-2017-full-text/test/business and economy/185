Dollar jumps as China vows euro investments
The Australian dollar scaled multi-month peaks against the yen and rallied on the US dollar on Wednesday after China reiterated its support to euro zone government debt, lifting risk sentiment.
The Aussie responded by rallying to $US1.0746 in late trade, from a two-week low of $US1.0629 hit on Tuesday. It was still short of last week's six-month high of $US1.0845, but a move above Tuesday's top of $US1.0739 would suggest an end to corrective consolidation.
The dollar got a boost early on Wednesday morning, after Greek political leaders agreed to provide written commitments to stick with promised austerity measures.
Both of Greeceâ€™s major political parties have committed to implement austerity measures beyond the next election, expected in April, in order to secure a bailout package for the debt-stricken country.
The Australian currency made further gains after the Chinese central bank expressed confidence in the euro and pledged to continue buying European sovereign debt.
The Antipodean currency had already been up on the yen after the Bank of Japan surprised on Tuesday by launching another round of quantitative easing, boosting stocks there.
