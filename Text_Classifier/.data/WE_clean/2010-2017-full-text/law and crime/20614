Roman Polanski testifies at extradition hearing in Poland
If court approves extradition request, justice minister will decide whether to hand over film-maker to US authorities
The film director Roman Polanski has testified at a court hearing in Poland regarding a US request for his extradition over a 1977 child sex crime conviction.
Dariusz Mazur, the judge presiding over the case in Krakow, said the court could not make a ruling on Wednesday because it still had to consider extra documents submitted by Polanski’s lawyers.
“The proceeding will not be finished today,” Mazur said, adding that the film-maker’s lawyers had handed in preliminary documents in English and in German from his unsuccessful extradition proceedings in Switzerland in 2010.
Polanski’s hearing started at 9am local time and was closed to the media. Under Polish law, if the court rules in favour of the extradition request, it will then be passed on to the justice minister who will make the final decision on whether to hand over Polanski to the US authorities.
The Oscar-winning director pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl during a photoshoot in Los Angeles fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain. He fled the country the following year, believing that the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him in jail for years.
In 2009, Polanski was arrested in Zurich on a US warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him.
