And the winner of 'The Voice' is ...
Vocal power? Check. We were treated to that when Chin dueted with Celine Dion, apparently her longtime hero, on Dion's "Love Can Move Mountains" -- and more than held her own. And heart? Well, Chin is all heart, beaming warmth and kindness. Levine said singing "Let It Be" with her on Monday night was like singing "with an angel from heaven." The love was mutual. "A better coach for me I could not find," Chin told her coach before learning she'd won. "You are just a great, solid guy." But on Tuesday, moments after she'd been handed her trophy and hugged her mom, it was Chin's pure professionalism that was on display. Breathless and stunned, she nevertheless took her mark and sang the song OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, who also performed Tuesday night, had written for the winner. She kept at it, gaining strength as the confetti fluttered all around her and landing it like a pro, like a winner, like someone who was born to sing. "You deserve it," rival coach Aguilera, fresh from her performance with could be heard telling her. She does.
