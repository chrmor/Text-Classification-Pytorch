N. Korea confirms seizing S. Korean fishing boat
SEOUL, Aug. 19 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Thursday said it has seized a South Korean fishing boat, carrying four South Korean and three Chinese crewmembers, confirming the fate of the ship and its crew for first time since they were seized nearly two weeks ago.   In a short dispatch from Pyongyang, the North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed the boat, Daeseung, had violated the inter-Korean border. The 41-ton boat disappeared Aug. 8 while en route to a joint fishing area between the two Koreas off the east coat of the Korean Peninsula. It has been believed to have been abducted by the North, but Pyongyang has until now remained silent on several inquires by Seoul on the fate of the ship.   The communist nation, however, said the ship was seized Aug. 10.   "According to our initial investigation, the ship was carrying four South Korean and three Chinese crewmembers, and their testimonies have shown that their ship had violated our exclusive economic zone," the KCNA report said.   bdk@yna.co.kr (END)
