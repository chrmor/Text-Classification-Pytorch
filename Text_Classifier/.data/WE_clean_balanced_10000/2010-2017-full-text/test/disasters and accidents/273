U.S. Navy Relieves Admiral of Command After Collisions
WASHINGTON—The U.S. Navy removed the commander of the fleet that has suffered four recent collisions in Asia and the deaths of several sailors, the Pacific Fleet said in a statement.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Navy was planning to remove Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin—the three-star commander of U.S. Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan—though officials had declined to comment.
