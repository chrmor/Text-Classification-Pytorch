BigDog Robot Can Now Hurl Cinder Blocks
If you thought the military's BigDog robot was scary before, then get a load of what it can do now.
The four-legged robot, developed by Boston Dynamics with funding from the U.S. Army's Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, can now pick up and hurl cinder blocks. Boston Dynamics on Thursday posted a YouTube video (below) showcasing BigDog's new skill.
In the video, the 240-pound robot picks up a concrete cinder block, moves it to the left, then tosses it over its right shoulder before the block hits the ground and smashes into pieces.
"The goal is to use the strength of the legs and torso to help power motions of the arm," according to the video's description. "This sort of dynamic, whole-body approach is routinely used by human athletes and animals, and will enhance the performance of advanced robots."
Big Dog, dubbed "the most advanced rough-terrain robot on earth" can run at speeds up to 4 mph; climb 35-degree slopes; trek through muddy trails, rubble, snow, and water; and even carry a 340-pound load on its back, according to Boston Dynamics. The goal for BigDog is to eventually go anywhere people and animals can go.
Besides BigDog, Boston Dynamics is also working on several other animal-like robots. The company is developing a robotic pack mule, dubbed the Legged Squad Support System (L3), which can walk up to 20 miles carrying 400 pounds of gear, even up and down hills.
