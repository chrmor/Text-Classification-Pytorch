Police disperse fighting Northern Irish and French football fans as Euro 2016 violence spreads 
Fighting broke out between supporters of Northern Ireland and hard-core French hooligans in Nice on Saturday night.
Police were called in to disperse the “Ultras” who set upon the supporters who had gathered ahead of the team’s opening Euro 2016 clash with Poland.
According to L’Equipe, seven people were injured, with one supporter suffering a serious head injury.
The local paper, Nice Matin, reported that the trouble started when hooligans threw a bottle at the Northern Irish fans who had been drinking amicably with their Polish counterparts at a pedestrian precinct which had been turned into an open-air pub.
Singing the Marseillaise, the French hooligans appeared to be determined to provoke the visitors, the paper said.
The fighting escalated  and  ended with punches and dozens of bottles being thrown.
