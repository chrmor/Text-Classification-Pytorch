Six killed in Russian test flight
Six people are reported to have been killed in Russia after an Antonov-148 plane crashed during a test flight.
Reports say the crash took place in the Belgorod region about 350 miles south of Moscow.
The two pilots are understood to have been from Burma. The Interfax-AVN news agency said the Burmese air force has ordered two An-148s, though it was not immediately known if the plane that crashed was to be delivered to the country.
The An-148 is a regional high-wing jet with a maximum range of about 3,000 miles and passenger capacity of 99.
There was no information on the cause of the crash. State airline Rossiya criticised the An-148 last year for door lock and engine problems.
