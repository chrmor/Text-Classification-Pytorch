No culture of fear on UK streets
Prime Minister David Cameron has promised vigorous and wide-ranging measures to restore order and prevent riots erupting again on Britain's streets - including taking gang-fighting tips from American cities.
Cameron told MPs there would be no "culture of fear" on Britain's streets, as police raided houses to round up more suspects from four days of rioting and looting in London and other English cities.
He said the government was "acting decisively" to restore order after the riots, which shocked the country and the world.
"We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets," Cameron said.
"We will not let a violent few beat us."
MPs were summoned back from their summer holidays for an emergency session of parliament on the riots as government and police worked to regain control, both on the streets and in the court of public opinion.
