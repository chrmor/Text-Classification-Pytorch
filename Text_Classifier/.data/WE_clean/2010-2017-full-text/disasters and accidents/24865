South African gold mine collapse: Dozens rescued, three workers missing, after cave-in at Australian-operated Vantage Goldfields site
Dozens of people have been rescued after a cave-in at a South African gold mine, but its Australian-based operators say three workers are still missing.
The collapse at the mine's main entrance trapped 87 workers underground, all of whom were rescued, Vantage Goldfields confirmed in a statement.
The small gold producer said there were no fatalities, but said three others who had been working on the surface at the time could not be accounted for.
"The three missing are office workers, not miners. We are not going to rest until we find them," Mike Begg told reporters at the mine near the town of Barberton in Mpumalanga province.
Work at the mine, about 360 kilometres east of Johannesburg, has been suspended pending an investigation into the collapse.
Reporters were not allowed near the site where the cave-in occurred, and a crowd stood outside the perimeter fence awaiting word on the results of rescue attempts.
Vantage Goldfields is an Australia-based company mining gold at Barberton, a town that traces its origin to South Africa's 19th-century gold rush.
"At this point, it's unclear what caused the disaster," according to Manzini Zungu, a spokesman for the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union.
South Africa's mines are the deepest and among the most dangerous in the world. The number of deaths in the industry has fallen due to both improved safety practices and a reduction in the labour force as production declines.
Last year, 77 workers were killed in mining accidents, the lowest number on record, compared with 84 in 2014.
