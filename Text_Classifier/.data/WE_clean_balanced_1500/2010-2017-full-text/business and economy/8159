Hacker group plans BofA e-mail release Monday
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Anonymous, a hacker group sympathetic to WikiLeaks, plans to release e-mails obtained from Bank of America Corp early Monday morning, according to posts on the group’s Twitter feed.
The group, unrelated to the document leak website founded by Julian Assange, said it plans to release documents exposing “corruption and fraud” at the largest U.S. bank by assets.
A Bank of America spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
