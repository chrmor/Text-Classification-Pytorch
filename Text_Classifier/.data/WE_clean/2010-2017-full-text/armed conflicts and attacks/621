Lurgan bomb condemned by Sinn Fein and SDLP
Three children injured after being caught in the explosion
Sinn Fein and the SDLP have condemned those behind a bomb attack in Northern Ireland which injured three children.
The young victims suffered light injuries but were said to be deeply shocked after being caught in the explosion. A bomb went off in a wheelie bin close to the railway line in Lurgan, Co Armagh.
SDLP assembly member Dolores Kelly said the Lurgan bomb was a despicable act.
"This was a despicable attempt to draw police in and then set off a bomb precisely where they would have been trying to keep other people back out of danger, and that is why the children were injured by debris from the explosion.
"There are two other security alerts in the town, one in a builder's yard. People are absolutely furious and no wonder," she said.
Sinn Fein's John O'Dowd described it as senseless and said those responsible were oppressing the nationalist community.
The attack was one of three bomb alerts in Lurgan yesterday as well as two other suspected bombs in Greencastle, Co Antrim and Castlewellan in Co Down. The geographic spread of yesterday's security alerts is another indication that republican dissident terror groups opposed to the peace process are co-ordinating their attacks across Northern Ireland.
Earlier a huge security operation was mounted in Derry after 15,000 loyalist Apprentice Boys marched through the centre of the mainly nationalist-Catholic city. There were no reports of trouble although police did come under petrol bomb attacks in the early hours of Saturday morning.
