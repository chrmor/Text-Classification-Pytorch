Man featured on CNN's 'The Hunt' killed during arrest
A U.S. marshal was shot once in the leg. It's unclear whether the second marshal was shot in the arm or the injury resulted from shrapnel and flying glass, according to the source briefed on the investigation.
Muniz and the two U.S. marshals went to the store to see if he was there. The detective entered the shop, recognized Mozdir and then left, police said. The marshals and Muniz then went back into the store to arrest him, and that's when Mozdir opened fire, authorities said.
Mozdir was arrested in California in 2012 after the young son of two close friends told his parents that Mozdir had touched his private parts. Mozdir was at their house, helping care for the now 7-year-old boy, who was ill with a high fever. His parents, who requested that their names not be used, immediately went to police.
"He was on the run for almost two years. And this family was destroyed, terrified that he would come back and hurt them because they had the courage to come forward and file charges against him," Walsh said Monday.
On the run from authorities, Mozdir had apparently shared with others his plan to one day kill the young boy's father for turning him in, Walsh said. "And now they don't have to worry if this guy's coming back to hurt the family or hurt their little boy. So there's a big sigh of relief tonight that Charles Mozdir is off this planet."
"It really reaffirms my belief that people don't want to be vigilantes. They want to be involved and do the right thing," he said.
"This is our first capture. I'm very sorry that those police officers got wounded in the line of duty," Walsh said, "but this is one more lowlife that's off the streets."
