Wind postpones rocket launch at Wallops Flight Facility
Strong winds near the ground shook treetops within the Capital Beltway on Saturday, while in a far corner of the Washington region, strong winds aloft postponed a major rocket launch.
Saturday afternoon, NASA reported that “excessive wind levels” at high altitudes had delayed the launch of Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket at the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore.
The launch was rescheduled for Sunday at 5 p.m.
The unmanned launch has been described as a key step toward carrying out plans for private companies to send supplies to the international space station.
Sunday’s goal is to test both the rocket and a simulated cargo carrier that is to separate from the rocket.
Descriptions indicate that the launch will be visible from the District, low in the southeastern sky.
