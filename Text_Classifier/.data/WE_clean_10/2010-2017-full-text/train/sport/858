2014 Brazil World Cup: Construction worker dies while working on Amazonia Arena in Manaus
A construction worker has died in an accident while working outside the World Cup stadium where England will play their first group game.
Local authorities in the Brazilian city of Manaus said 55-year-old Antonio Jose Pita Martins died after an accident while he was dismantling a crane outside the Amazonia Arena.
Portuguese national Martins is the third person to die while working on or near the ground, and the sixth to perish while preparing the 12 stadiums for this year's tournament.
The Amazonia Arena should have been completed in December according to FIFA's original deadline, but is behind schedule and workers are said to be rushing to get the job finished.
Amazonas state governor Omar Aziz cancelled a planned visit to the stadium because of the accident, an official statement said.
The first fatal accident at the venue was in March last year and a second worker died in December when he fell from the roof after a cable snapped.
One worker has been killed in Brasilia, and two people died in Sao Paulo after a crane collapsed at the stadium which will to host the opening game on June 12.

Manaus, located at the heart of the Amazon rain forest, will host four games, including the high-profile encounter between England and Italy their first group game.
It will also stage the United States v Portugal, Cameroon v Croatia and Honduras v Switzerland games.
