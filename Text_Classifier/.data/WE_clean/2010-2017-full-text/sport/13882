Australian Open kicks off in Melbourne today
MELBOURNE: One of the most anticipated events of professional tennis – the Australian Open – starts today with Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Roger Federer among top contenders coveting the prestigious title.
US Open champion Murray, who lost to Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open final, confessed he has ‘no idea’ how he will feel when he steps on court at a major tournament for the first time as a grand slam winner.
“I have no idea how I’m going to play here and how I’m going to feel when I enter onto the court,” Murray told ESPN. “I said that I feel more relaxed, but I don’t know. The day when I play my first match, I could be unbelievably nervous — I don’t know what effect it will have on me until I’m put in that situation. But I also know how hard these events are to win.”
Meanwhile, a feisty Lleyton Hewitt warned his Australian Open first round opponent Janko Tipsarevic that he plans to ‘knock him off’ after showing vintage form to win the Kooyong Classic.
The tenacious veteran, 31, is bursting with confidence after demolishing Argentina’s Juan Martin Del Potro in the final of the warm-up tournament. And Hewitt has no fear of Tipsaveric, who won the ATP Chennai Open in his preparation for Melbourne.
“I don’t care, I’ll knock him off, try to take his spot in the draw,” said Hewitt, who made the fourth round of the Open last year. “I look forward to the challenge. The last couple of matches I’ve hit the ball as well as I can remember. I feel confident with where my game is at the moment.”
In the women’s singles event, Serena Williams goes into the Australian Open a red-hot favourite in her quest for a sixth title, while reigning French Open champion Maria Sharapova is also in contention for the title after losing out to world number one Victoria Azarenka last year.
Australian hopes rest with former US Open champion Samantha Stosur, who has yet to win a match this year.
