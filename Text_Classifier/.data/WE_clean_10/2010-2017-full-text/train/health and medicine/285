Colombia blames 3 deaths on Zika, nerve disorder
Colombia said Friday that three people had died after contracting the Zika virus and developing a rare nerve disorder called Guillain-Barre, the first time health officials have directly blamed the mosquito-borne disease for causing deaths. Ospina, an epidemiologist, said another six deaths were under investigation for a possible link to Zika. Colombia has been hit hardest by the Zika outbreak of any country except Brazil, with more than 20,000 cases, including more than 2,000 pregnant women.
