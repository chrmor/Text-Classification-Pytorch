Tong wins third term as Kiribati president
Kiribati President Anote Tong has been returned to power for a third term.
Mr Tong received just over 42 per cent of the vote in Friday’s presidential poll, more than seven per cent ahead of his nearest rival Dr Tetaua Taitai.
Rimeta Beniamina won just under 23 per cent of the vote.
Mr Tong’s winning margin has been reduced – he won the 2007 election by 64 per cent.
But voter turnout was up – more than 68 per cent of eligible voters took part in the election, up from just over 50 per cent in 2007.
