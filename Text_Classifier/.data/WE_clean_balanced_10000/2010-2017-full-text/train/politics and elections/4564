Jordanian King Asks PM Rifai to Form New Government
Jordan’s King Abdullah asked Prime Minister Samir Rifai to form a new cabinet following the resignation of the government, the state news agency Petra said.
The reshuffle comes after Jordan held parliamentary elections on Nov. 9.
The king also called on the new parliament to meet Nov. 28 for its inaugural session, according to a royal decree published today by Petra.
Pro-government and tribal candidates swept Jordan’s parliamentary elections as the Islamists who form the country’s largest opposition group boycotted the vote.
King Abdullah, who appoints the government in Jordan, can dissolve the legislature and rule by decree in its absence. He exercised that power a year ago after lawmakers stalled legislation backed by the cabinet aimed at spurring foreign investment, including a new corporate tax law.
