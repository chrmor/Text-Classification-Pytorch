Australia acknowledges participating in US alliance attack on Syrian Army position in Deir Ezzor – Syrian Arab News Agency
Sydney, SANA – Australia acknowledged that its aircrafts participated alongside the US alliance aircrafts in the aggression that targeted Syrian Arab Army positions in Deir Ezzor.
The Australian Department of Defense said in a statement on Sunday that it will cooperate fully with the review of the incident by the alliance, asserting that while Syria remains a dynamic and complex operating environment, Australia would never intentionally target a known Syrian military unit, nor would it provide support for ISIS, offering condolences to the families of the victims of the attack.
The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces had reported that US alliance aircrafts targeted at 5 PM on Saturday a Syrian Arab Army position in al-Tharda Mountain in the surroundings of Deir Ezzor Airport, causing losses in lives and equipment.
The Foreign and Expatriates Ministry sent two letters to the UN Secretary-General and the head of the Security Council in which it said that the US aggression was premeditated and paved the way for ISIS to seize the position.
