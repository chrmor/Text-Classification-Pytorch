Katy Perry Removes Islamic Symbol From 'Dark Horse' Clip After Protest
A pendant bearing the word "Allah" has been removed from Katy Perry's "Dark Horse" video, after a petition on Change.org met its signature goal. According to Shazad Iqbal, the U.K. resident who wrote the complaint, the clip was "highly controversial" due to its "portrayal of blasphemy."

Iqbal claimed that at the video's 1:15 mark, a man wearing the pendant is burned. "Such goes to show, that blasphemy is clearly conveyed in the video, since Katy Perry (who appears to be representing an opposition of God) engulfs the believer and the word God in flames," the petition said. "This is the reason for lodging the petition, so that people from different walks of life, different religions and from different parts of the world, agree that the video promotes blasphemy, using the name of God in an irrelevant and distasteful manner would be considered inappropriate by any religion."
Over 65,000 people endorsed the petition. Yesterday, Iqbal commented on the petition, "Guys I'm thrilled to let you all know the name of Allah has been removed from the 'Dark Horse' video. We couldn't have done it without everyone's support, so I thank each and every one of you deeply. Our voices have been heard! God bless you all. بارك الله فيكم"
