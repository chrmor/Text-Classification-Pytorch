Fighting resumes in South Sudan after president declines to sign peace deal
A military spokesman says fighting has resumed between South Sudanese troops and rebels two days after the president declined to sign a peace deal.
Col. Philip Aguer said Wednesday that there is fighting in Manyo County in the state of Upper Nile. He said the clashes are happening near the border with Sudan, with rebels trying to take areas controlled by government troops.
He said there was also fighting Tuesday in Eastern Equatoria state in an area where there previously had been no fighting, suggesting the rebels were opening up a new front.
Kiir on Monday declined to sign a peace agreement with his former deputy Riek Machar, saying he needed more time to consult.
