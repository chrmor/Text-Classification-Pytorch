Palestinian rocket attacks, Israeli airstrikes after collapse of Gaza cease-fire talks
Palestinian militants are firing rockets from Gaza and Israel is launching airstrikes following the end of a cease-fire and the collapse of talks aimed at a lasting truce.
Palestinian militants fired at least 7 rockets at Israel Wednesday, the military said. Some 30 airstrikes were carried out in Gaza overnight, it said.
Fighting resumed Tuesday after Gaza militants fired dozens of rockets at Israel hours before an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire was set to expire. Israel withdrew its delegation from Cairo and responded to the rocket fire with airstrikes, while Palestinian negotiators declared the cease-fire talks over.
The fighting dashed hopes for a lasting truce after a monthlong war that has already claimed over 2,000 lives, mostly Palestinians.
