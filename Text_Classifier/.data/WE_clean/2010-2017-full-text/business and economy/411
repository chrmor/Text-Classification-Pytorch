Honda Motor Co. said Monday it is recalling more than 380,000 of its vehicles to fix a problem with the ignition switch that can lead to a vehicle rolling away and causing a collision.
The problem is that the ignition interlock mechanism can be damaged or worn during use. After that occurs, it could allow the ignition key to be removed without the car being shifted into park, allowing the car to roll away. It is Honda’s third recall related to the problem since 2003.
The Japanese automaker said it will recall about 197,000 Accord and 117,000 Civic vehicles from the 2003 model year and roughly 69,000 Element vehicles from the 2003 and 2004 model years in the United States.
Honda said it received several complaints about such failures in the vehicles and is aware of a handful of related incidents, including one that resulted in a minor injury. 
The company said it will begin to notify customers that their vehicle requires repair in late September and encourages the owners of the affected vehicles to visit an authorized dealer as soon as they receive notification.
