Donald Tsang charged with misconduct in public office by ICAC
Former Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has been formally charged by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) with misconduct in public office.
Reports said that Tsang appeared at the ICAC headquarters on Monday morning and was charged with two instances of misconduct in public office, due to failing to make a declaration of interest in Executive Council meetings.
Tsang will appear in Eastern Magistrates’ Court in the afternoon.
RTHK reported that Tsang said he acted in strict accordance with the rules in his 45 years of public service and that he was happy to cooperate with the ICAC.
In 2012, allegations against Tsang receiving benefits from tycoons surfaced. It was reported that Tsang took several trips with business tycoons on jets and yachts, and rented a luxury apartment in Shenzhen.
The decision to prosecute came after a drawn-out investigation spanning three years. In September, Former Director of Public Prosecutions of Hong Kong Grenville Cross said the sluggish pace of the investigation could “make the Guinness World of Records.” In June, Keith Yeung Kar-hung, the current Director of Public Prosecutions, said that there will be a decision on whether to prosecute Tsang for corruption in three months.
