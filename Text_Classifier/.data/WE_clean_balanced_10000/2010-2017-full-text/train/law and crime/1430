Ugandan 'hang them' paper has no regrets after David Kato death
With a circulation of fewer than 3,000 copies Rolling Stone would have remained obscure were it not for the anti-gay campaign
The Ugandan newspaper that last year called for the hanging of gay activist David Kato who was murdered on Wednesday, said it had no regrets about its story.
Giles Muhame, managing editor of the weekly Rolling Stone, said in a statement that he condemned the murder and felt "sorry for the family of Kato". But he also repeated various unproved allegations against the activist, and suggested he lived in an area where murder is common. "This looks like any other crime," he told the Guardian in a telephone interview. "I have no regrets about the story. We were just exposing people who were doing wrong."
Muhame and other recent graduates of Makerere University in Kampala launched Rolling Stone late last year. With a circulation of fewer than 3,000 copies it would have remained obscure were it not for the anti-gay campaign.
For its 2 October issue, it pictured Kato and another man on the front page under the words "Hang them", and the sub-headlines "We Shall Recruit 100,000 Innocent Kids by 2012: Homos" and "Parents now face heart-breaks [sic] as homos raid schools". The paper promised to expose 100 gay people, and printed the photographs, names, and in some cases home areas, of people it claimed were gay. A few weeks later Rolling Stone carried another frontpage story with the headline "More homos' faces exposed", with the identities of 17 people inside.
Only after Sexual Minorities Uganda, the organisation for which Kato worked, took the matter to court was an interim order granted stopping Rolling Stone from publishing any more names and pictures. The injunction is now permanent.
