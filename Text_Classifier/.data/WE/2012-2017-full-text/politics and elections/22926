Trump Vows North Korea Threat Will Be Met With 'Fire and Fury'
Trump's remarks came just hours after reports that North Korea had developed a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on a missile â€” and the White House said Wednesday "the words were his own."
"General Kelly and others on the NSC team were well aware of the tone of" the president's statement before it was delivered," White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday, stating that both "the tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand."
The president and his chief of staff have been in "constant contact" with members of the National Security team while on a "working vacation" in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
Defense Secretary James Mattis, in a statement on Wednesday, urged North Korea to "stop isolating itself and stand down in pursuit of nuclear weapons."
"The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people," the statement continued.
"While our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth," Mattis said in the statement, warning that any North Korean action would be "grossly overmatched by ours."
U.S. officials believe North Korea now has the capability to put a nuclear weapon on a missile, NBC News reported on Tuesday, confirming a report in The Washington Post. According to a U.S. official briefed on the assessment, the advance does not mean North Korea has a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can survive reentry accurately.
Last month, North Korea proved its missile capabilities have reached a point where U.S. cities are within "target range."
