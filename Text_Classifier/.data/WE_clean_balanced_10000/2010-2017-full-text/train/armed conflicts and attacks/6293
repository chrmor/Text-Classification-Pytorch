Car bomb rocks eastern Turkey
A car bomb has wounded nine people in the eastern Turkish province of Tunceli, according to the security services.
The explosion on Monday happened in Ovacik district, about 800km east of the capital Ankara, near a housing block for civil servants working at a local courthouse.
Turkey has been frequently targeted over the past year by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group and Kurdish separatists.
It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack. A splinter group of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),Â the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), claimed a car bombing last week in Istanbul, which killed 11 people including several police officers. The PKK claimed another deadly blast last week in Midyat town in the Kurdish-majority southeast, which killed six people, including a pregnant policewoman.
