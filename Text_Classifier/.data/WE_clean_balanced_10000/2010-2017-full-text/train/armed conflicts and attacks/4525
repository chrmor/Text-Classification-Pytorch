Attacks, and Accusations, Escalate in Eastern Ukraine
MOSCOW â€” Fighting between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply in recent days, with each side blaming the other for the violence.
At least nine people were killed in artillery strikes on Monday in villages and towns on both sides of a cease-fire line, and United States officials have said that one three-day period of fighting along the front last week was the most intense since a February cease-fire.
Neither side has openly renounced the cease-fire, but European monitors of the accord say both have been pulling heavy weapons out of storage sites and putting them to use.
The United States State Department blamed Russia and pro-Russian rebels for the uptick in violence. American officials have characterized the fighting as possibly a new attempt by Russia to destabilize the Ukrainian government.
