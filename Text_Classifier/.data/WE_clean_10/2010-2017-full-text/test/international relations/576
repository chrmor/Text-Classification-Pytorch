Envoy's pat-down unacceptable, India to take it up with US
The Ministry of External Affairs will shoot a very strong mail to the US State Department to protest the manner in which Indian ambassador to the US Meera Shankar was pulled out of an airport security line and patted down by an American security agent.
This, despite the Americans being told of her status and the fact that she enjoys complete diplomatic immunity.
Reacting to the incident, External Affairs Minister S M Krishna said on Thursday afternoon that Shankar's body-search was "unacceptable".
"There are certain well-established conventions, well established practices as to how diplomats representing other countries should be treated in a particular country. I am rather surprised in the manner Shankar has been treated. That too, for the second time in the last three months. This is unacceptable to India. We shall take it up with the US," he said.
He said this can be resolved so that such "unpleasant incidents" do not recur. "We have cordial relations with the US and we want to take it further," Krishna said.
"There are various procedures by which the matter can be taken up with the US," he added.
Krishna has also asked for a report on what had happened.
South Block, sources said, is bristling with anger that Shankar should be patted down the second time so far in American airports. Last time too, the Indian government had lodged a strong protest.
It is learnt the Indian mission in US has protested too.
Ministry sources said they had taken lightly the recent pat-down of Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel at a Chicago airport because he was on a private trip and not escorted by any Indian diplomat.
But this incident has rattled the External Affairs Ministry. More so, because American diplomats to India, ministry sources said, are accorded total immunity from any search.
