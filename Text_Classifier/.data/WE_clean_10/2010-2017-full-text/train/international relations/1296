Petition to Ban Trump's State Visit to UK Reaches 1M Signatures
LONDON â€” A petition to cancel President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom topped 1 million signatures Monday.
However, the British government said it would be going ahead with the event as planned.
The petition, which was launched Sunday, said that Trump should be allowed to enter the U.K. "in his capacity as head of the U.S. government," but suggested that the official state visit should be canceled "because it would cause embarrassment" to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
"Donald Trump's well-documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales," it added, referring to the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, who is second in line to the throne. "Therefore, during the term of his presidency, Donald Trump should not be invited to the United Kingdom for an official state visit."
The British Parliament must consider debating any petition that reaches more than 100,000 signatures.
However, a spokesman for the British government told NBC News on Monday that the state visit would be going ahead as planned. "The invitation for the state visit has been extended and accepted," he said.
A government sourcetold the BBCthat canceling the state visit would be a "populist gesture" and would "undo everything."
