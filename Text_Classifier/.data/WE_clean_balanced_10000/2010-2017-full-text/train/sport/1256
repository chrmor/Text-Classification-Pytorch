Berlin to host 2015 Champions League final
The German FA (DFB) is very hopeful that the country will win the race to host the 2015 Champions League final, Bild has reported.
Earlier this year, the DFB lodged an application to stage the event in Berlin, and the organisation's president, Wolfgang Niersbach, told the paper: "We can have high and justified hopes that the Champions League final will come to Berlin."
Bild reported that a deal has already been done but will not be officially announced before March, while Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel said the chances of the 2015 final being in Berlin "are very good".
According to Bild, the 2014 final will be played in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz and Milan's San Siro will host the 2016 final.
If Germany is successful, the Olympiastadion will be the venue for the final. Speaking in April, Niersbach compared the venue to Wembley and said: "Berlin is a great place for a final. I could almost say that a Berlin final would have more atmosphere than Wembley."
