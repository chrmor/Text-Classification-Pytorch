Nigeria charges Cheney in Halliburton bribery scandal
Nigerian authorities filed charges Tuesday against ex-US vice president Dick Cheney and several others over a bribery scandal allegedly involving energy firm Halliburton, the prosecutor said.
"It includes Dick Cheney," said prosecutor Godwin Obla of the 16-count charge filed at a court in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
"There are conspiracy charges and giving gratification to public officers. There is also a charge for obstruction of justice."
A spokesman for the country's anti-graft agency confirmed the charges had been filed against nine suspects, including Cheney, who was head of Halliburton before becoming vice president after the US elections in 2000.
The case involves an alleged $US182 million ($184.2 million) cash-for-contract scandal over 10 years until 2005 over construction of a liquified natural gas plant in southern Nigeria.
