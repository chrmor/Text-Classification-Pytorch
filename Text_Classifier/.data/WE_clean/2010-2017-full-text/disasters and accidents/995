DR Congo plane crash in Bandundu 'kills 20'
A plane has crashed in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 20 people, officials say.
One person was also critically injured as it came into land in Bandundu, about 200km (125 miles) west of the capital.
A BBC reporter in Kinshasa says it hit a house, but no-one is thought to have been hurt on the ground.
DR Congo, the size of western Europe, has few roads after decades of civil war, and has one of the world's worst air safety records.
The BBC's Thomas Hubert says the plane crashed 2km from the airstrip as it attempted to land just after midday.
Colonel Joli Limengo, the local chief of police, told our correspondent that most of those on board had died in the accident, including the two pilots - who were believed to be Belgian nationals.
He said that 19 bodies were pulled from the wreckage along with two survivors, one of whom later died.
The aircraft was operated by Filair, an airline based in Kinshasa, and was due to stop over in Bandundu town before continuing its journey to the capital.
Our reporter says Filair, just like all airlines registered in DR Congo, is on the European Union's no-fly list because of the country's poor air safety record.
Transport Minister Laure-Marie Kawanda said a team had arrived in Bandundu to investigate the crash.
