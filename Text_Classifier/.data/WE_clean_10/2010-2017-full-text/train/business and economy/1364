BP Slapped With Record Fine
BP said it has reached an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve all criminal charges and claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with 2010's deadly Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill. Angel Gonzalez has details on Lunch Break.
BP PLC agreed to accept criminal responsibility for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 workers and to pay $4.5 billion in fines and restitution, the biggest penalty ever levied by the U.S. Justice Department.
But the oil producer still faces an even costlier battle with the government over civil penalties for the pollution unleashed when the drilling rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.
