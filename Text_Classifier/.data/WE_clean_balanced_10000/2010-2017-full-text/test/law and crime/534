Mexican police investigate abduction of 22 people in resort town
(CNN) -- Mexican police have identified 22 people who were kidnapped by gunmen in the Pacific resort town of Acapulco and have found four cars they were riding in, state media reported.
But investigators are looking for more leads in the case, the state-run Notimex news agency said Saturday night.
Police said the 22 people -- who were abducted in Guerrero state on Thursday -- were from the neighboring state of Michoacan.
"We are trying to find the whereabouts of the people who filed the complaint, but we have no more details," said state police investigator Fernando Monreal Leyva, according to Notimex.
He said authorities combing the cars for clues had found clothing and shoes but no weapons.
