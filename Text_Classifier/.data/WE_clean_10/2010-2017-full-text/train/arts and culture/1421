Sting cancels Kazakhstan concert over 'repression' of striking workers
Sting has thrown his support behind striking Kazakh oil and gas workers, cancelling a gig that was to take place on Monday night in the country's capital of Astana. At the last minute, the singer announced he would not cross a "virtual picket line" to perform at the government's Astana Day festival.
"The Kazakh gas and oil workers and their families need our support and the spotlight of the international media on their situation in the hope of bringing about positive change," Sting said on Sunday. These were the singer's first comments on a labour action that began on 26 May; Sting said he had been provoked by Kazakhstan's "hunger strikes, imprisoned workers and tens of thousands on strike".
Sting is in the second year of his Symphonicity world tour, which came to the UK in October 2010. The Astana concert had been on his calendar for months, alongside dates in Russia, Hungary and Ukraine. But Amnesty International drew the singer's attention to events in Kazakhstan, particularly the "repression and crackdown against oil workers, their union leaders, their legal representatives and of the human rights NGOs". "Amnesty International feel [Sting's] presence in Astana will be interpreted as an endorsement of the president's administration and surely will go against everything he has stood for," they said.
Kazakh oil workers began protesting against their poor treatment almost six weeks ago, saying their salaries have been cut and their lawyer imprisoned on false charges. Estimates of the number of workers on strike vary from 2,500 to 16,000, and the country's second-largest oil producer, KazMunaiGas EP, has claimed 3,000 barrels per day in lost production. "Their demands are groundless and illegal," a KazMunaiGas spokesperson told Reuters.
The economy of Kazakhstan is the largest in central Asia. It has been ruled by president Nursultan Nazarbayev since its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.
