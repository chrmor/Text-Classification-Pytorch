The Euro zone tells Greece that it must stay with its reform package or risk being forced out of the euro zone by cash-flow problems. (Reuters)Unlike the first round of the Haitian parliamentary elections when balloting was cancelled in 22 constituencies, voting appeared orderly, and largely peaceful, with a large turnout in Sunday's presidential and parliamentary second round elections. Electoral officials said there might be partial results in 10 days but final results would not be ready until late November. Haitians faced lengthy ballots featuring 54 presidential hopefuls and significant numbers of legislative and municipal candidates. An expected runoff between the top two presidential candidates is scheduled for December 27. (Miami Herald) (AP via Washington Post) (AFP via Capital Broadcasting Network)
