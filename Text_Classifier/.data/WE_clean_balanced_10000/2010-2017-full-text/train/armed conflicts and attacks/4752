Daraya surrenders to Assad regime after four years of siege and starvation
For four long years the Damascus suburb of Daraya endured siege, bombardment and starvation at the hands of the Syrian regime. 
The city was one of the first to rise up in peaceful protest against Bashar al-Assad during the early days of the Arab Spring and it stood strong in face of his violent oppression. 
But on Friday Daraya’s long defiance came to an end and the city finally surrendered to the regime troops who have besieged it since 2012. 
Its loss is a blow to the Syrian rebels as Daraya, which is just 15 minutes from central Damascus, was an icon of resistance. Its capture is both a symbolic victory for Mr Assad and a battlefield success that will free up his troops to fight elsewhere around the Syrian capital.
