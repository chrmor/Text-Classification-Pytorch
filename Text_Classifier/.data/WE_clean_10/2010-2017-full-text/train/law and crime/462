Gunmen Kill 15 in Mexico; Gang Link Seen
MEXICO CITY — At least 15 young people, several of them in treatment for drug addiction, were shot and killed Wednesday at a car wash in western Mexico, the third mass shooting with apparent connections to organized crime in less than a week.
The latest killings were in Tepic, a city in Nayarit State about 400 miles west of Mexico City, and bore the hallmarks of a drug-related crime. Drug treatment centers have frequently been the site of shootings, often by groups of men firing high-powered weapons, because members of drug gangs seek help or hide out in them.
In this case, 10 of the 15 people were clients of a treatment center in the city, the director of the clinic told reporters, and they were killed by automatic weapon fire. Some victims appeared to be innocent bystanders, the police said.
The shooting followed the killing of 13 people at a drug rehabilitation clinic in Tijuana on Sunday and the shooting deaths on Friday of 14 young people, several of whom the authorities said had no association with the drug trade, at a birthday party in Ciudad Juárez.
The Tijuana shooting may have been connected to Mexico’s record seizure of 134 metric tons of marijuana last week; the authorities said that the police had received threats of additional violence.
