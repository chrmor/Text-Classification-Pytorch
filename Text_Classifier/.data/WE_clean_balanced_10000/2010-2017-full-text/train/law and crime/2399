Criminal Case on Costa Concordia Wreck Opens
Hundreds of lawyers, victims’ families and survivors of the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, which capsized off the Tuscan coast in January, converged on Grosseto, Italy, on Saturday for the first evidence hearing in the criminal investigation against the ship’s captain and others.
So many people had the right to attend that prosecutors had to move the hearing from the courthouse to a 1,000-seat theater. More than 4,230 people are considered parties in the case, and there were more than 50 lawyers at the hearing on Saturday.
The giant cruise ship with about 4,200 passengers aboard hit a rock off the Tuscan island of Giglio, tearing a gash in the hull and partly sinking the ship, killing 32 people.
The main order of business on Saturday was to appoint experts to analyze data from the ship’s recording devices, including the black box.
Prosecutors hope the recordings will help pinpoint the actions of the ship’s captain between the time of the impact and the evacuation order, which was given more than an hour later. Prosecutors have argued in preliminary documents that the crew delayed the evacuation.
The ship’s captain, Cmdr. Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest near Naples on preliminary charges of manslaughter, neglecting to report the accident to port authorities, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship before passengers were taken to safety. Captain Schettino did not attend the hearing because he was not required to, one of his lawyers said.
