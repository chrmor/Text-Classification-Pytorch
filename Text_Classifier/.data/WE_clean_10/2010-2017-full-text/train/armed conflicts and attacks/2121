Oman forces crack down on protesters
SOHAR, Oman, March 29 (UPI) -- Security forces in Oman cleared blockades throughout the city of Sohar in a pre-dawn raid Tuesday and arrested a number of protesters, officials said.
The forces raided the Globe Roundabout, rousting and arresting encamped protesters before dismantling the impromptu camp site, witnesses told Gulf News. "Everything is normal and army has taken charge of the city," said Ali al Badi, who lives in the industrial port city.
Protesters have demanded political reform in the government of Sultan Qaboos Bin Saeed.
Residents and social media postings indicated government forces also raided several houses and arrested suspected vandals accused of attacking government offices this week.
The Public Prosecution office, in a statement Tuesday, said complaints filed by citizens concerned rioting, vandalism and breach of public order. The office said it authorized the raids based on the complaints.
"Sohar residents have complained that the normal life was affected under the circumstances," the statement said. "We have asked competent authorities to arrest those disturbing the public order with their acts and bring them to justice."
