Five policemen killed by Russian 'Black Widow' suicide bomber
Police said the woman was the wife of a militant who was killed last month in the republic, which is the most violent in Russia’s North Caucasus. Islamist insurgents have been fighting state security forces in the region for more than a decade.
The woman blew herself up on Tuesday near Karabudakhkent, a village about 25 miles south of Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan on the coast of the Caspian.
Investigators said the bomber had approached officers at the checkpoint and detonated a device packed with metal shards equivalent to two kilos of TNT.
Insurgents supporting her then rushed forward to execute policeman wounded in the blast.
Militants in the region are mostly part of a coalition of fundamentalists called the Caucasus Emirate, which aims to carve out an Islamic state ruled by Sharia law. The movement grew out of Chechnya’s failed bid for independence.
The militants have carried out many high profile suicide bombings including at Moscow’s Domodedovo airport last year, killing 37 people, and at two Moscow metro stations in 2010, killing 40. Women who have lost their husbands in fighting are frequently the perpetrators, earning them the name Black Widows.
The bomber at Karabudakhkent was identified from her remains as Aminat Ibragimova, 25, the wife of a fighter called Zaur Zagirov whom security forces killed last month. The leader of the insurgency in Dagestan, Ibragim Daudov, and his son also died in that clash.
The North Caucasus insurgency remains Russia’s most serious internal security threat and there are concerns it may spread west in the run-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Rebel websites, which sometimes exaggerate casualty figures, claimed 10 “police puppet terrorists” had been killed in the blast at Karabudakhkent.
