Former Brazil coach Dunga appointed Internacional boss
Former Brazil manager Dunga has been appointed as Internacional's new boss, returning to the club where he began and ended his career.
Dunga replaces Fernandao, who lasted less than six months in charge at the club, and the 49-year-old will take charge with his coaching team in time for the beginning of the 2013 season.
The ex-midfielder, who captained Brazil's 1994 World Cup-winning side, has been out of work since standing down as coach following Brazil's loss to Netherlands in the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup.
His reign as coach of the national side was a largely successful one, which saw Dunga lead his team to the 2007 Copa America and 2009 Confederations Cup titles, and an Olympic bronze medal in Beijing in 2008.
