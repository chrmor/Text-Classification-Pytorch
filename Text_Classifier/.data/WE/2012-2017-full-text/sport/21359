Kurt Busch survived a rough and tumble race to capture the Daytona 500 Sunday. It was Busch’s first career Daytona 500 victory and his first win in 32 races at Daytona International Speedway. He twice finished as runner-up. it was his 29th career victory.  It was also the 36th victory by a Ford — the fifth time in the last nine years that Ford has won the Daytona 500. Joey Logano was the last Ford driver to win the race in 2015.  Ryan Blaney was second with AJ Allmendinger third, Aric Almirola fourth and Paul Menard in fifth.  The victory was the first for Tony Stewart as an co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing at Daytona.   The race featured nine cautions and 37 lead changes included several in the final laps with Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson both running out of gas towards the end.   Much like the earlier races this week including Saturday’s Xfinity Series race — aggressive driving led to multiple crashes which wound up taking out some of the biggest names in NASCAR including Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jimmie Johnson and Danica Patrick. Twenty-five of the 40 cars that qualified finished the race with the rest forced to watch from the garages and less than half of the field was on the lead lap. Busch leads the points standings by 12 points over Ryan Blaney.  Kyle Larson survives rash of wrecks to lead after 400 miles It was too good to last.  After a relatively uneventful first half of the Daytona 500, the second half turned into a demolition derby with three different multi-car crashes involving half of the field that ended up knocking out drivers like Jimmie Johnson and Danica Patrick.  Kyle Larson took the lead after 400 miles.  The second wreck of the afternoon brought out the fifth caution of the day after Trevor Bayne nudged the right back side of Jimmie Johnson, sending his No. 48 Chevrolet spinning into the wall in Turn 4 while also taking out at least 17 cars in the process including Clint Boyer, Chris Buescher, Denny Hamlin, Kurt Busch, Martin Truex and Danica Patrick. The crash took out several drivers including Buescher, Johnson and Patrick.  “They started running into the back of me off of Turn 2 and didn’t stop until I crashed and took out the field,” said Johnson. “That could have been avoided and it wasn’t called for. From the minute, I got off of Turn 2 on the entire back straightaway, I kept getting hit and the rear tires are off the ground.” The sixth caution flag of the day came out a few laps later following another crash. This one involving Trevor Bayne who was looking to head to the pits but spun out, taking Elliott Sadler and Ricky Stenhouse Jr.  A few laps later another multi-car wreck took out a handful of drivers including Jamie McMurray and Brad Keselowski.  Only half of the 40 car field was on the lead lap.  Kevin Harvick won the second segment of the Daytona 500 Sunday after a 17-minute stoppage following the first crash of the day which took out Dale Earnhardt Jr.  The wreck happened on Lap No. 104 when Kyle Busch went sideways after losing a tire on Turn 3 taking out a handful of cars including Earnhardt Jr. and teammates Erik Jones, Matt Kenseth and Ty Dillon.   The wreck brought out the third caution of the day and eventually, NASCAR officials brought out the red flag to stop the race.  “It was just a weird day because of the segments and how everybody would pit off cycle,” said Kenseth.  The back side of Busch’s No. 18 Toyota was smashed up badly forcing him into the garages, ending his day under new NASCAR policy. Earnhardt Jr. made it back to pit row and back onto the track before the red flag but his crew wasn’t able to get the No. 88 Chevrolet repaired in time and his day was over. “I thought we could get the car fixed … but there was too much damage,” Earnhardt Jr. said on television. “We just couldn’t drive it like that. “I really enjoyed the whole week,” he added. “At least we went out leading the race.” This is the second straight year in which Earnhardt failed to finish the Daytona 500 and the fourth time a crash ended his chances in this race.  There have been six different leaders and 19 lead changes in a somewhat uneventful race.

Kevin Harvick regained the lead in the Daytona 500 after 200 miles. Ryan Blaney was second followed by Jimmie Johnson in third.  Kyle Busch captured the first stage after leading the race after 60 laps. Under NASCAR’s new championship points system this season, races are divided into three stages — with a playoff point awarded to the winner of the first two stages, and the race winner receiving five points. Busch has one career victory at Daytona International Speedway, back in 2008. He finished third in last year’s race.  There have been six different leaders and 17 lead changes in a somewhat uneventful race. Jamie McMurray has led the race 13 laps so far.  Kevin Harvick grabbed the lead after the first 100 miles of the Daytona 500 Sunday. Harvick is looking for his third career victory in this race and his first since 2010. Unlike the Duels and the Xfinity Series race this week, the drivers have been very patient in their handling of the Daytona International Speedway. Harvick, Jamie McMurray and Chase Elliott all held the lead at one time or another early on. In a somewhat surprising move, all six Toyotas chose to head to the pits on Lap 17; a strategy the group hoped would allow them to remain among the leaders heading into the green-checkered finish for the first segment. The first caution of the day came out on Lap 26 when rookie Corey LaJoie misjudged his exit to pit row and while trying to abort his entry, spun out hitting the wall instead. LaJoie was able to avoid the five minute penalty and make his way back into the field.   It must seem like déjà vu as Elliott, who was on the pole last year as a rookie but an early wreck forced him to finish the race in the back of the pack. Dale Earnhardt Jr. began the race next to Elliott in the front row. It was his first race back after sitting out 18 races last season with a concussion. Earnhardt has four career wins at Daytona, the last coming in 2015, and 13 top five finishes at the track during his career. Dale Junior: Has anyone mentioned Dale Earnhardt Jr.? NASCAR’s favorite son is back after missing 18 races last season with concussion-related symptoms. The NASCAR Nation rejoices.  … “Am I nervous at all about it?” he said. “ I’m nervous about it until I get in the car. I can think about it while I’m out of the car all day long. Of course I’m human, I’m going to be concerned and worry … but to be able to win the qualifying race and to be able to win the Daytona 500, you’ve got to race with no fear.” Changes: Industry leaders -- including a handful of drivers—came together during the off-season and blew up the Chase format model. Races in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series will now consist of three stages, with championship implications in each stage. The new format will award a playoff point to the winner of the first two stages, and the race winner will receive five points. This year's Daytona 500 will consist of two 60-lap stages, followed by a final 80-lap stage to make up the 200 scheduled laps in the annual season-opening race. Crashes: Given the chase for pints during the race, expect a handful of “Big Ones” as drivers will get more aggressive toward the end of each stage. Look for the action to rev up with about two laps to go during each segment.

NASCAR dramatically altered its racing format in the off-season, with drivers now able to earn points during different stages of races, which will also have planned caution periods. It will sort of be like having three races within one. OK, there’s a lot to take in. Let’s try to break it all down: What’s hasn’t changed: Points will continue to be accrued through the first 26 Cup series races and will carry over for the 16 drivers who qualify for the playoffs that consist of the last 10 races of the season. The operative number remains at four in a winner-take-all-finale in Homestead in November. What are the stages? For today’s Daytona 500, Stage 1 ends on Lap 60, Stage 2 ends on Lap 120 and the race ends on Lap 200. There are different levels of importance and points associated with each stage in the race. What about Stage 1? Drivers who are running first through 10th at the conclusion of Stage 1 will receive stage bonus points, starting with 10 points for first place, nine points for second place, and so on, down to one point for 10th place. Plus, the driver who finishes Stage 1 first will receive one playoff point to carry into the postseason, should that driver qualify. At the end of Stage 1, there will be a planned caution period for drivers to come down pit road. What about Stage 2? This stage of the race begins when the green flag drops for the restart. The same point system is in place as it was for Stage 1. Drivers who are running first through 10th at the conclusion of Stage 2 will receive stage bonus points, starting with 10 points for first place, nine points for second place and so on. Also, the driver who finishes Stage 2 first will receive one playoff point to carry into the postseason. Just as at the end of Stage 1, there will be another planned caution period at the end of Stage 2. The final stage starts when the green flag drops. What about the Final Stage? There are 80 laps left in the race, and the goal here is to win. Race points are then awarded to the entire field based on the order of their finish. The race winner receives 40 points, second-place finisher receives 35 points, third-place receives 34 points, fourth-place receives 33 points, and so on until you get to the drivers who finish 36th through 40th, who get one point each. The race winner will also get five bonus points to carry into the postseason. What are the maximum points a driver can earn? So, what’s a perfect day at the track – winning the first two stages as well as the race – mean for points? The maximum points a driver can earn in a race is 60 (40 for the race win plus 20 points for winning both stages), plus a maximum of seven points (one each for winning the first two stages and five for winning the race) to carry into the postseason.  What else do I need to know about points? There will no longer be a bonus points given for leading a lap, or a bonus points for leading the most laps. Who came up with this system? Industry leaders — including a handful of drivers — came together during the off-season and blew up the old Chase format. Races in the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series will also use the new stage point system.
Should I keep a calculator next to the TV during races? Wouldn’t be a bad idea. Now, let’s go racing.

Sparks will sing the National Anthem before the race while Tomlinson served as an honorary starter. Sparks, who competed on and won American Idol in 2007, also performed the National Anthem at Super Bowl XLII. But for Sunday’s race, she also had to make sure that she matched with the USAF Thunderbirds flyover. “When I sing that big note at the end, you know, you want them to be flying over right on time,” she said. “There’s always a little bit more pressure when it’s live.” Tomlinson, a former NFL MVP and part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame 2017 class, is excited to be the honorary starter and got some important advice before the race. “Having that flag, Jimmie Johnson told me ‘just don’t drop it,’” he said. “I wasn’t a guy that fumbled a lot so I’m not really worried.” This image released by Lionsgate shows Keanu Reeves in a scene from, "John Wick: Chapter 2."

It was announced that he will star as a NASCAR driver in a new movie, “Rally Car.” Former Daytona 500 champion Mario Andretti is back at the track where he won  50 years ago. Andretti addressed the NASCAR media before Sunday’s race. “I’m looking for a ride,” he joked. Andretti says times have changed from when he took laps around the Daytona International Speedway. “Driving was different,” he said. “Now you’re just [accelerator] down to the floor.” Andretti said his car was very loose during the 1967 race, and some suggested that drivers were afraid to pass him — allowing him to stay at the front of the pack. But there was a reason for that. “I had to [race up front] because that’s where the car felt the most comfortable. Owen Wilson may need more Daytona rehearsal Owen Wilson, grand marshal for today’s race, has the responsibility of commanding the drivers to start the Daytona 500. Though, he might need a little practice. “It shouldn’t be too tricky. It’s just ‘Racers, start you engines,' right?” he said. Well, that’s not it exactly. It’s “Drivers, start you engines,” a NASCAR official corrected. “I’m just going to try to put some bass into it and hope for the best,” he said. His “Wedding Crashers" co-star Vince Vaughn, who was previously a Daytona 500 grand marshal, texted Wilson advice: Don’t watch Vaughn’s YouTube clip of his driver command, because he said it was perfection. As for who is his favorite driver, Wilson — who stars in the upcoming “Cars 3” animated movie, picked an unusual one. “Lightning McQueen would be my favorite, because I am contractually obligated to say that,” Wilson said.

Sparks will be singing the song, while the pilots will be doing a fly over of Daytona International Speedway. The goal, the Thunderbirds said, is to soar over the speedway when Sparks sings “… and the home of the brave.” But it will be tricky. Sparks says she thinks it will take her 1 minute, 36 seconds to complete the anthem. Meanwhile, the Thunderbirds will be trying to hit their mark while flying their jets just 3 feet apart from each other. SEE MORE VIDEOS For the second consecutive year, the Daytona 500 is a sellout. And there were a lot of pro sports athletes among the big crowd. They included Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots, Brandon Marshall of the N.Y. Jets, as well as the Magic’s Nikola Vucevic and Jeff Green. Gronk was introduced at the drivers’ meeting. He met with media before the green flag dropped, and was greeted with calls of “Gronk!” by fans as he went to pit row to greet drivers.
