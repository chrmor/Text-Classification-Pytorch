Dotcom extradition papers filed
The United States Government has filed its application to have Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom and three associates extradited to face charges of breaching copyright.
Crown Law is handling the case on behalf of the US Government.
A spokeswoman from Crown Law confirmed today that the papers had been filed in the North Shore District Court.
Crown Law had 45 days to file the papers following raids on the internet millionaire's rented $30 million Coatesville mansion and other sites across Auckland in January.
The 38-year-old and his associates, Mathias Ortmann, Bran van der Kolk and Finn Batato, are accused of breaching international copyright laws to the value of US$500 million.
The US alleges that the group used the file-sharing site Megaupload in what US prosecutors allege was a "mega conspiracy".
They face charges of conspiring to commit racketeering, conspiring to commit money-laundering, copyright infringement and aiding and abetting copyright infringement.
A date for the extradition hearing has been set down in August.
