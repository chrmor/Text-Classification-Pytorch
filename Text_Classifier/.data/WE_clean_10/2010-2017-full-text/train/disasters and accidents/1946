Rain piles misery on China flood region
Overnight thunderstorms have brought new misery to a remote area of northwestern China as the death toll from weekend flooding and massive landslides rose to 1117.
The rains on Thursday triggered new mudslides, leaving five more missing, and another swollen river threatened to overflow.
The National Weather Centre forecast heavy rains in the coming days - up to nine centimetres of precipitation was expected in the already saturated region on Friday - and said the threat of additional landslides along the Bailong River was "relatively large".
An overnight deluge triggered more mudslides that swept away six houses in Xizangba village, blocked a river near Libazi village, and obstructed a key road used to ferry relief goods, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing local authorities in Gansu province.
Another mudslide in nearby Tianshui city buried seven people, though two were quickly rescued, Xinhua said. In another part of Gansu, 250,000 residents of Chengxian county faced the threat of flooding as waters rose in the Donghe River, local officials said.
Tents set up as emergency shelters were flooded, and traumatised victims said the storms were a frightening reminder of the deluge that brought on Sunday's disaster in which three villages in Gansu's Zhouqu district were swallowed in waves of mud and rubble-strewn water. Hundreds of homes were completely buried.
