Israel Renews Bid to Free Soldier Held by Hamas
JERUSALEM —Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel had recently renewed contacts with a German mediator to negotiate the release of a captured Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, who is being held by Hamas.
“We are working all the time and in various ways to try to bring Gilad back,” Mr. Netanyahu told Israel’s Army Radio. “One of those ways, even the main way, is through negotiations, which indeed resumed a few weeks ago.”
Hamas officials had stated over the weekend that in recent weeks, the German mediator had visited Gaza, which is governed by the Islamic militant group. Ayman Taha, a Hamas spokesman, said the visit was “exploratory,” according to The Associated Press.
Sergeant Shalit was seized in a crossborder raid by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in June 2006, and was taken into Gaza. He was 19 at the time, and efforts to end his prolonged incarceration in Gaza have become an emotional cause in Israel.
The latest contacts that could lead to an agreement to release Sergeant Shalit in exchange for Palestinian prisoners come at a time of uncertainty surrounding the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Hamas opposes Israel’s existence and the peace talks with the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank, but is nonetheless interested in a prisoner exchange.
