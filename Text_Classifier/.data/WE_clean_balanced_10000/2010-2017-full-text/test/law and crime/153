Three dead in Michigan after inmate overtook officers
At least three people were reportedly killed at the Berrien County Courthouse in Michigan following a shooting Monday afternoon.
Larry Darnell Gordon, 45, had been at the courthouse for a hearing on multiple felony charges when he overpowered the two bailiffs escorting him. Gordon disarmed one man and fatally shot both the two bailiffs, Berrien County Sheriff Paul Bailey said in a press conference Monday evening.
The deceased bailiffs have been identified as 61-year-old Joseph Zangaro and 63-year-old Ronald Kienzle, longtime law enforcement officers who became court officers following their retirements.
Deputy James Atterberry and a civilian were also injured and remain at a local hospital.
Gordon took hostages for a short period of time during the incident, but was killed by other officers who responded to the scene.
Police are still investigating the incident. The courthouse is in St. Joseph, Mich., in the southwestern part of the state.
