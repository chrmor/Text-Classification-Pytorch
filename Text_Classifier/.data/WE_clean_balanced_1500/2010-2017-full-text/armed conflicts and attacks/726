Paramount tells theaters no ‘Team America
First “The Interview” and now this.
Paramount Pictures has ordered theaters in Cleveland and Atlanta to not show “Team America: World Police” instead of Sony Pictures’ “The Interview,” according to The Daily Beast.
The theaters were going to show the 2004 film because Sony cancelled “The Interview” due to alleged North Korean terrorist threats.
If you don’t remember, “Team America: World Police” is the original film making fun of the hermit kingdom and is by the creators of “South Park,” where an actor joins a counter-terrorism task force whose mission is to kill Kim Jong Il — current leader Kim Jong Uns’ father — and stop an imminent terrorists attack.
