Burundi crisis poses 'catastrophic' risk for region: AU
The African Union warned Sunday of potential "catastrophic consequences" for troubled Burundi and the wider region if rivals do not resolve political differences peacefully. One day after the former head of Burundi's army during its 13-year civil war was assassinated, further fueling fears of a new conflict, AU Commission chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma called for "utmost restraint" by all sides. Bikomagu was a major figure in the army during the civil war which raged between 1993 and 2006 and left at least 300,000 people dead.
