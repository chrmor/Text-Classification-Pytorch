25 killed in northern Nigeria attacks
Nigeria ABUJA: At least 25 people have been killed in coordinated attacks by unidentified men armed with machine guns, bombs and rocket-propelled grenades in northern Nigeria , police said.
They said that targets of the attacks were a tavern, a bank, a police station and a prison at Ganye town in Adamawa state. During the attacks on late Friday, an unspecified number of prisoners were freed and unspecified amount of money looted. Thirteen people were shot dead at the tavern while others were killed at different places, state police chief Mohammed Ibrahim said. Elsewhere in another northern city of Kano where suicide bombers killed scores of people last week, two bombs went off and killed two suspected suicide bombers pushing a cart. The attack in Ganye and Kano bore the signature of radical Islamic outfit - Boko Haram - though no group has claimed responsibility. Boko Haram, which has killed thousands of people, has promised to fight the government until it concedes to its demand of allowing it to carve out an Islamic caliphate out of northern Nigeria.
