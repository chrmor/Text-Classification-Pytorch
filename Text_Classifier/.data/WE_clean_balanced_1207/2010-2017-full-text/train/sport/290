Michael Phelps has added another triumph to his list of accomplishments: the Associated Press male athlete of the year.
The retired swimmer edged the Miami Heat's LeBron James in voting announced Thursday, a fitting payoff for winning four gold medals and two silver medals at the London Games, as well as recognition for becoming the most decorated Olympian ever.
Phelps finished with 40 votes in the media balloting, winning the award for the second time. James had 37, followed by track star Usain Bolt with 23. Carl Lewis is the only other Olympic-related star to capture AP male athlete of the year more than once, taking the award in 1983 and '84 for track and field. The only men honored more than twice are golf's Tiger Woods, cyclist Lance Armstrong and basketball's Michael Jordan.
Andersen took the Wisconsin job Thursday, taking over for Bret Bielema. Bielema left to take the Arkansas job.
Utah State President Stan Albrecht and Athletic Director Scott Barnes said hiring the 39-year-old Wells allows the football program to continue to build on the tremendous progress made by Andersen over the last four years.
