Orwell's resignation letter, sent to LF Rushbrook Williams, the Eastern Service Director, outlines the reasons behind his decision to leave the BBC in 1943. He makes it clear that he has no disagreement with the Corporation and has been well treated. He does, however, feel that the task of broadcasting propaganda to India is completely pointless, stating that he prefers to concentrate his efforts on journalism and may be travelling to North Africa on behalf of 'The Observer'.
