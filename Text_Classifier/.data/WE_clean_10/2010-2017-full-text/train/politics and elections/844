South Carolina Democratic presidential primary: Poll open, close times, delegates, rules, things to know
South Carolina Republicans went to the polls last Saturday, giving their state's 50 GOP delegates to businessman-turned-politician Donald Trump. Now, it's the Democrats turn.
South Carolina Democrats will hold their primary Saturday, Feb. 27 to choose between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Polls show Clinton with a sizeable lead in South Carolinagoing into Saturday's vote but nationally, the race is much closer.Clinton, the long-time Democratic front-runner, edged out Sanders in Iowa and Nevada but he won New Hampshire earlier this month.
Clinton's campaign is expecting a boost from African-Americans in the Southern state, a sizable constituency that have been among her more reliable supporters.
South Carolina has an open primary, meaning you do not have to be a registered Democrat to vote in the election. However, Republicans who voted in the GOP primary can't also vote in the Democratic one.
There are 53 Democratic delegates up for grabs in South Carolina, with an additional six unpledged "Super Delegates," party leaders that can support whatever candidate they want no matter how their state votes. Sanders can capture a portion of the South Carolina's pledged delegates since primaries held before Super Tuesday apportion delegates based on percentage of votes received. However, Clinton holds a massive lead in Super Delegates with 451 compared to Sanders' 19, giving her 502 total delegates to Sanders' 70. A candidate needs 2,382 delegates to win the nomination. Polls will be open from 7 a.m.-7 p.m. ET.
The South Carolina primary is the final one before Super Tuesday on March 1, a day when voters in 11 states will go the polls to pick their nominees.
