Thousands of Toyota workers are striking for a fifth day this month over a pay claim.
More than 3,000 workers at the company's Altona plant in Victoria and at parts centres in Sydney and Melbourne are involved in the action.
The workers are seeking a 12 per cent pay rise over three years.
But Toyota Australia's Glenn Campbell says the company's offer of an 11 per cent rise is reasonable and the industrial action will only harm the workers themselves.
"The costs are mounting. More than $50 million in lost sales, 3,300 cars not produced, and the employees' hip pockets being hit again this week," he said.
"This type of action is unnecessary and it's undermining Australia's reputation as a car maker, and it does undermine job security for our work force."
Dave Smith from the vehicle division of the Australia Manufacturing Workers Union will not rule out further action despite it costing the company $10 million a day.
He says says higher living costs have left members with no choice but to strike.
"The state of the industry is an issue, there's no two ways about that," he said.
"The high Australian dollar is really causing problems, but also utility costs, cost-of-living costs, those sorts of things. Members tend to think about their own private budgets and at the moment they are quite under strain."
