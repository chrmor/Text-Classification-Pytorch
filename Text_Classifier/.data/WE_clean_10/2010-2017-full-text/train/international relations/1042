Tree maintenance has come into sharper focus recently following the government’s controversial decision to cut down four giant century-old banyans in August, and the collapse of a number of trees in recent months that have caused injuries. With experts expressing concern over the health and maintenance of trees citywide, the South China Morning Post has put together an interactive guide to the condition of more than 3,000 trees across Hong Kong, based on the latest data contained in a register originally created by the Development Bureau in 2010. Our map contains information on the health of more than 900 trees included in the register along with 2,700 others deemed "failed" or which were removed and not found on the register.
