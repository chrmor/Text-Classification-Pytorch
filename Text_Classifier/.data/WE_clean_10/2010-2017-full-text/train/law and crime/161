Jason Van Dyke, Chicago Officer Who Shot Laquan McDonald, Pleads Not Guilty
CHICAGO — Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer charged with murder for the 2014 shooting death of Laquan McDonald, pleaded not guilty during a brief court appearance Tuesday morning, setting a case that has stirred emotions here and across the country on a course toward trial.
Officer Van Dyke, who is free on bond, stood silently before Judge Vincent Gaughan as his lawyer, Dan Herbert, entered the not-guilty plea. Officer Van Dyke was charged last monthwith murder just hours before a dashboard camera video of him shooting Mr. McDonald 16 times was released, setting off protests and calls for changes to policing here.
After court, Mr. Herbert said that Officer Van Dyke was eager for his side to be made public and that his client believed he was innocent of the first-degree murder and official misconduct charges he faces.
Mr. Herbert had previously said he might seek a change of venue for the trial, citing intense news media scrutiny and Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s critiques of Officer Van Dyke. Mr. Herbert said Tuesday that he was continuing to consider such a request, but for now was satisfied with the selection of Judge Gaughan, of the Circuit Court of Cook County, to hear the case.
