The Capitals have turned to another alumnus to serve as the team's head coach.
Adam Oates, the New Jersey Devils assistant coach who spent a portion of his long playing career in with the Capitals, has been named the team's new head coach, according to a report from TSN's Darren Dreger.
"He has been an assistant coach in our conference for the past three seasons and is prepared to lead our club as head coach," Capitals General Manager George McPhee said in a statement.
The team will introduce Oates as their new head coach at a press conference at Verizon Center on Tuesday afternoon.
Oates replaces Dale Hunter, who left the franchise after less than one season to return to lead the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League, who he left to take the Capitals coaching job last season.
The 22-year NHL veteran went into coaching after he retired in 2004. He had spent the last two years as an assistant with the Devils, helping them to the Stanley Cup Finals last season. He also spent one year as an assistant with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
Oates played for the Capitals from 1996 to 2002 and was a member of the 1997-98 team that won the franchise's only Eastern Conference championship. He also went to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2003 as a member of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
In addition to being named the new head coach of the Capitals, Oates was also elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame on Tuesday.
In 22 seasons in the league with Detroit, St. Louis, Boston, Washington, Philadelphia, Anaheim and Edmonton, Oates scored 341 goals and 1,079 assists, ranking him 6th all-time on the NHL's assist list. In 387 games with Washington, Oates tallied 363 points.
