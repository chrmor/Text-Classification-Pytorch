President Wade's son named Senegal's energy minister
Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade has replaced the minister of energy with his son Karim, who is already in charge of several government portfolios.
The dismissal of the minister, Samuel Sarr, comes after a week of street protests against frequent power cuts.
Correspondents say the move has added to speculation the 84-year-old leader is grooming his son as his successor.
The president has said he plans to seek re-election in 2012 despite a dispute over him running for a third term.
Some parts of the country suffer power cuts often lasting most of the day.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund warned that insufficient electricity supply threatened Senegal's economic recovery.
Mr Wade, a longtime opposition leader, came to power in elections in March 2000.
