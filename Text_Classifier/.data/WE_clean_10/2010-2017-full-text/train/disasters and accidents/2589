Small plane crashes in Colombia capital; 5 dead, 7 injured
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A small plane crashed into a residential area of Bogota shortly after taking off from the capital's airport Sunday, setting a bakery on fire and killing five people and injuring seven, including two in critical condition, authorities said.
Civil aviation officials said the plane had taken off from Bogota's El Dorado airport three minutes before it went down in the Engativa neighborhood. It was headed to the town of Guaymaral, 20 kilometers (12½ miles) from Bogota.
The city's police chief, Maj. Gen. Humberto Gatibonza Carreno, told The Associated Press that the pilot and his three passengers died.
One person also was killed in the bakery and seven others inside the business suffered burns, including a 12-year-old girl, officials said. Two of those taken to hospitals were reported in critical condition.
It was the third crash of a small plane in Bogota in three months. Three people were killed in August when an aircraft crashed in the Cajica area, and three more died in October when a plane smashed onto a highway.
