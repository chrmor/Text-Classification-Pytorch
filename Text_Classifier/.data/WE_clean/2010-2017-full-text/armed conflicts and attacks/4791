Protests in Gaza ask Egypt to open Rafah border
GAZA CITY (Ma’an) -- Two days after Egypt's leader Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign, a youth movement in Gaza gathered in the capital city's Square of the Unknown Soldier calling for Egypt to open its border with the coastal enclave.
The General Union of Youth Organizations gathered more than 100 in the central square, saying that they stood in solidarity with the people of Egypt, and asked for the new leadership cancel its agreements with Israel and open the Rafah crossing. “Israel is the enemy,” protesters yelled, urging Egypt to break out of the agreements it has with the country as it goes forward with its process of renewal. Protest organizer Hafeth Sharab said the initiative was one of the young people in Gaza, an outpouring of support for the success of the Egyptian revolution, and a call to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza. Young people in the Gaza square invited the protesters from Cairo's Tahrir Square to visit the coastal enclave, and to see for themselves what and end to the siege would mean.
