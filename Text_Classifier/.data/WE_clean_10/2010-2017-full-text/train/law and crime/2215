George Zimmerman murder trial
After more than 15 hours of deliberating, the six-woman jury in the trial of George Zimmerman has found the neighborhood watchman not guilty. Zimmerman was accused of profiling, pursuing, and fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen, in February 2012. Zimmerman, 29, could have faced life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The jury also had the option to consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, which could have meant up to 30 years in prison.
