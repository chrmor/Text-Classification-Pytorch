St. Patrick's Day celebratons abound in U.S.
(CBS) Parades, parties and pub crawls are will be the order of the day everywhere Thursday to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.
Originally an Irish holiday to salute the saint who, legend has it, drove the snakes from Ireland, St. Patrick's Day is marked the world over, including in London, which jumped the gun this year with a weekend parade.
Parades are scheduled in cities across the U.S. , including New York, where a green stripe is painted up Fifth Avenue, and Chicago, where the river is dyed green.
While pub crawling may the rule of the day - there's a big one scheduled on Las Vegas' Fremont Street - Irish entertainers are on the program at a lot of venues including New York's Radio City Music Â Hall, which will be host to Celtic Woman, and Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto, which is featuring the Chieftains.
