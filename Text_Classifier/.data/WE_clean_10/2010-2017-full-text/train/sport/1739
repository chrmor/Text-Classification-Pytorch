Oldham Athletic's Filipe Morais 'heavily concussed'
A professional footballer remains "heavily concussed" in hospital after being involved in a car crash in Greater Manchester.
Oldham Athletic's Filipe Morais was involved in the crash on Sheepfoot Lane while travelling to the club's ground ahead of their game with local rivals Rochdale on Saturday.
Greater Manchester Police said two other cars had been involved.
A club spokesman said he did not know when Morais would be leaving hospital.
"He is in hospital and is heavily concussed," he said.
The club's manager Paul Dickov said after the game with Rochdale, which Oldham lost, that the Portuguese forward had also suffered "quite severe whiplash".
Morais had been due to start for Oldham in the game.
An elderly man who was also involved in the crash was treated for minor injuries at the scene.
