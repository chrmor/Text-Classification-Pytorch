Paris terror attack: France mobilises 10,000 troops at home as Hayat Boumeddiene thought to be in Syria
France will have more than 10,000 soldiers mobilised on home soil in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks in Paris last week.
Seventeen people, including journalists and police, and three gunmen died in three days of violence that began with the shooting attack on the political weekly Charlie Hebdo.
The bloodshed ended with a hostage-taking at a Jewish deli in which four hostages were killed.
Police said the three gunmen involved in the attacks were part of the same Paris-based militant Islamist cell.
In response, defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said 10,000 soldiers would be mobilised to protect the country.
"We have decided ... to mobilise 10,000 men to protect sensitive sites in the whole country from [Tuesday] evening," he said.
"It is an internal operation that will mobilise almost as many men as we have in our overseas operations.
"The threats remain and we have to protect ourselves from them.
"This is the first time that our troops have been mobilised to such an extent on our own soil."
Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 4,700 police officers would also be deployed at all 717 Jewish schools across the country.
Prime minister Manuel Valls said an estimated 1,400 people living in France had either joined the jihadist cause in Syria and Iraq or were planning to do so.
"There are 1,400 individuals who are involved in the departures for jihad, for terrorism, in Syria and in Iraq," he told BFMTV.
"There are close to 70 French citizens or residents in France who have died in Syria and Iraq in the ranks of the terrorists."
The latest government figures were a big jump from data in mid-December, when 1,200 people were said to have left or were seeking to leave to fight alongside jihadists.
Meanwhile, Turkey has confirmed that Hayat Boumeddiene, the wanted partner of supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly, travelled through Turkey last week on her way to Syria.
Boumeddiene is suspected of having had a role in Coulibaly's attacks, which culminated in the bloody hostage-taking in a kosher supermarket after he had shot dead a policewoman close to a synagogue the day before.
Turkey did not arrest her because of a lack of timely intelligence from France, one Turkish security source said.
But comments from several Turkish security sources confirmed Boumeddiene was outside France when the killing spree began.
Foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told Anatolia news agency that Boumeddiene entered Turkey on January 2 from Madrid.
Mr Cavusoglu said the 26-year-old, who married gunman Coulibaly in an Islamic ceremony, then stayed at a hotel in Kadikoy on the Asian side of Istanbul and was accompanied by another person.
The Turkish security source said after arriving in Turkey, Boumeddiene was believed to have moved on to the south-eastern Turkish city of Sanliurfa and then to Syria.
Boumeddiene crossed into Syria on January 8, according to her phone records, Mr Cavusoglu said, without making clear if she travelled to Syria on her own.
Western countries have long accused Turkey of not doing enough to stem the flow of jihadists seeking to join Islamic State (IS) group fighters in neighbouring Syria.
But Ankara insists it has now stepped up frontier security and has repeatedly said the West also has a responsibility to share intelligence.
In any case, Mr Valls said Coulibaly likely received help from others and the hunt for those accomplices would continue.
US secretary of state John Kerry said he would travel to Paris this week to express solidarity with the victims of the attack.
In a security initiative, Mr Cazeneuve said European interior ministers had agreed to boost cooperation to thwart further militant attacks.
He called for the creation of a European database of airplane passenger names and said Europe should fight against abusive use of the internet to spread hate speech.
Pope Francis also responded to the attacks, slamming "deviant forms of religion" and blamed "a culture of rejection" for the breakdown of society and spawning of violence and death.
"People become enslaved, whether to the latest fads, or to power, money, or even deviant forms of religion," he said.
"We see painful evidence of this in the events reported daily in the news, not least the tragic slayings which took place in Paris a few days ago."
He pointed to "chilling repercussions" from conflicts in the Middle East and "the spread of fundamentalist terrorism in Syria and Iraq".
"This phenomenon is a consequence of the throwaway culture being applied to God," he said.
"Religious fundamentalism, even before it eliminates human beings by perpetrating horrendous killings, eliminates God himself, turning him into a mere ideological pretext."
Francis also touched on some of the possible social and cultural issues which may be driving the continent's disillusioned young to jihadism.
He pointed to "a model of globalisation which levels out differences and even discards cultures, cutting them off from those factors which shape each people's identity and constitute a legacy essential to their sound social development".
