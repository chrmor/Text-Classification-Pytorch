Kurdish leader: SDF will counter Iraq’s PMU if it enters its areas in Syria
The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will counter Iraq’s mostly Iran-backed Shiite paramilitary forces if the latter enters areas under its control, a Kurdish leader told the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat in an interview.
The Syrian Democratic Forces, which groups Kurdish and Arab fighters, said they will never accept the presence of Iran and they will never under any circumstances act as a bridge between PMU and the Syrian regime.
On Tuesday, a US official said the United States has started sending arms to Kurdish forces to help them regain Al-Raqqa in Syria from ISIS.
