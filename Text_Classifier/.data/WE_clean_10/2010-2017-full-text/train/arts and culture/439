Solemn prayers mark Good Friday in city
LUCKNOW: Daylong prayer services were held at various churches as Christian community in the state capital observed Good Friday , which marks the day of crucification of Jesus Christ. "It is a day of silence, penance and prayer, and certain ceremonies are held to mark peace," said Rev Dr Donald HR De Souza, spokesperson, Catholic Diocese of Lucknow. "Also, no church bells, which are a sign of joy and celebration, were rung on Friday as this is a day of mourning and sorrow," he added. The flowers in churches were removed and all statues were covered with a cloth. There was no sign of joy and celebration in the churches so that people could feel the absence of Jesus Christ during two days - Friday and Saturday, until the glorious Easter, which is celebrated in a most solemn way at the Easter Vigil on Saturday night, a tradition following the Jewish custom of beginning the Sabbath and days of the week on the eve of the feast. Among the religious ceremonies that took place at Cathedral Church were reading of long, passion narrative, prayers for various intentions and the holy communion service where communion consecrated on Holy Thursday was distributed to the people and the veneration of the Holy Cross. In Lucknow, two additional ceremonies, the 'Way of the Cross' and the ceremony of 'Passion of Lord Jesus' took place. "It is a pious recollection of the final journey of Jesus Christ from his arrest in the garden of Gethsemane till his crucifixion together with a religious procession with a huge Cross in the campus," said De Souza.
