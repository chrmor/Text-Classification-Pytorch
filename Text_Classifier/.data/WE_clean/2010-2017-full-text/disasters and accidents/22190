Taiwan evacuates hundreds as Typhoon Soudelor churns towards island
Taipei/Yilan, Taiwan: Taiwan evacuated hundreds of people from their homes on Friday as the strongest typhoon to threaten the island in two years churned towards it and was expected to make landfall early on Saturday.
Authorities said 611 people had been moved, most from east coast areas, as Typhoon Soudelor approached. The storm has already claimed its first victims, with two people dead and one missing in choppy waters off the coast of Taiwan's northeastern Yilan county, the coastguard said.
Flights were cancelled, offices shuttered and schools suspended across the island. The island's high-speed rail service, operating normally on Friday, will be suspended as of Saturday morning.
Wind and rain whipped trees in the capital, Taipei, and media showed waves along the coast as high as five metres.
