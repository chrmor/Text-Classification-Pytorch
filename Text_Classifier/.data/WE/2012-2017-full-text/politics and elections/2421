East Timor PM's party to win most seats in 'peaceful' poll
The United Nations says Saturday's parliamentary election in East Timor was peaceful and well-run.
Holding successful elections is one of the criteria for the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor by the end of this year.
The head of the mission, Finn Reske-Nielsen, said Saturday's vote followed a successful Presidential election earlier this year.
"The parliamentary elections were from what we can see technically done extremely well by the national electoral authorities and on the security side we were delighted to note there was hardly a single security incident recorded," he said.
A provisional count shows Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao's National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) party has won the most votes, with the Fretilin party coming in second.
Electoral officials say Mr Gusmao's party is expected to take 31 of the 65 seats in parliament, two short of the absolute majority needed to govern alone.
But most parties have failed to win the three per cent of votes required to gain a seat.
Official results are not expected until July 17.
Professor Michael Leach from Australia's Swinburne University says the results show a consolidation of East Timor's party system.
"We're seeing people aligning very strongly behind these two leading parties and then we're seeing a third party with a reasonable vote," he said.
"I think when people reflect on this election, they'll see this as a positive sign for the development of national politics and democratic consolidation, that voters are cohering around a fewer number of more clearly defined positions."
