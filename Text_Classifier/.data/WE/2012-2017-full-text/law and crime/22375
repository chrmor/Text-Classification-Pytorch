Attorneys general to sue Trump for Constitution violation
Two attorneys general plan on suing President Trump, alleging he violated the U.S. Constitution by accepting payouts from foreign governments through his hotel empire, according to a report Sunday.
Brian Frosh of Maryland and Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said the two will lodge a joint-lawsuit against the President centered on the emoluments clause, which prohibits federal office holders from accepting payments from foreign states, the Washington Post reported.
“We’re getting in here to be the check and balance that it appears Congress is unwilling to be,” Racine told the Post, describing the case. “We’re bringing suit because the President has not taken adequate steps to separate himself from his business interests.”
Frosh and Racine, both Democrats, will also claim that Trump failed to distance himself from his Trump Organization assets — despite putting sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. in charge through a trust — and he continues to benefit from the White House
Trump’s business portfolio boasts of hotels in NYC, Las Vegas, Chicago and Miami. One of his hotels is located in the heart of the nation’s capital. The entrance to the Trump International Hotel in D.C. was splashed with guerilla art in May, suggesting that foreign guest could drop off bribes inside.
The Trump Organization also owns more than a dozen more golf clubs globally, including properties in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Jersey.
Multiple spokespersons for the prosecutors declined to comment on the case, pending a press conference scheduled for Monday at noon. 
If the case proceeds, the attorneys will demand Republican Trump’s elusive tax returns through discovery, the Post reported.
