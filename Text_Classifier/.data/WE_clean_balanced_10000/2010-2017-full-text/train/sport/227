Juventus win fifth straight Serie A title as Napoli lose to Roma
Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a fifth season in a row after Napoli's 1-0 defeat at Roma.
Sunday's 2-1 victory at Fiorentina put them on the brink of glory, and Napoli's failure to win on Monday meant Juve can no longer be caught.
It completes a stunning rise for the Turin side, who were in 12th place and 11 points off the top on 28 October.
However, they have won 24 of their 25 league games since, drawing the other, to take them clear.
Napoli's defeat denies Juventus the chance to win the title at their own ground. They host Carpi on Sunday at 11:30 BST.
Juve captain Gianluigi Buffon has now won seven Serie A titles with the club, who had another two stripped from them for a match-fixing scandal more than a decade ago.
"The moment we really turned a corner was scoring in the 95th minute against Torino," said the 38-year-old goalkeeper, referring to the 2-1 victory on 31 October that started their long winning run.
"That gave us a confidence boost and we began to see even the most unthinkable targets were within our reach.
"My first and this season's have been the greatest of all my Scudetto victories. This season has been crazy and unbelievable. This victory showed our strength both in terms of technique and character."
Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who has won the Serie A title in both of his two seasons in charge, said: "It has been a memorable season.
"Everybody thought we had no chance after our bad start, when many thought the club should have sacked me. We did very well to react after that poor start, winning 24 games out of 25 is almost impossible, but we did it."
