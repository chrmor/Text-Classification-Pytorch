A senior German official responsible for monitoring tsunamis off the coast of Indonesia says concern about the large number of sensor buoys not working in the system is misplaced.
Of the 23 sensor buoys installed in the ocean off Indonesia's coast, just nine are working.
Riduan Jamaluddin, an Indonesian official responsible for the Indonesian buoys in that array, says the gaps will hamper efforts to warn other nations in the region about the strength of a tsunami.
However, the coordinator of the German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System project, Joern Lauterjung, says the system has back up sensors built in.
He concedes validation of a tsunami could be delayed because of gaps in the chain of sensor buoys, but he says that data is quickly available from other sensors in the region.
In the wake of the tsunami which struck the Mentawai Islands this week, Riduan Jamaluddin revealed that only three or four have survived technical problems and vandalism.
An official tsunami warning was issued after Monday's 7.7-magnitude quake, but it either came too late or did not reach the communities in most danger.
Meanwhile, on the island of Java, a volcano, which this week killed 32 people, again spewed ash and deadly heat clouds.
