Karl-Anthony Towns, D'Angelo Russell go No. 1 and No. 2 at NBA draft
Harrell is well known for his thunderous dunks and the electrifying screams that inevitably follow. But where he is most likely to make his mark in the NBA is on the defensive end, especially in the paint. He averaged 9.2 rebounds last season, one-third on the offensive end. Relatively undersized for a power forward, Harrell makes up for it with ferocious intensity and enthusiasm, refusing to let bigger players back him down or post up. He collected more than a steal and a block per 40 minutes in college. But he lacks some polish and complete mastery of the fundamentals. He gets most of his scoring (15.7 points last season) in the paint.
