2015 Pulitzer Winners: South Carolina Paper Wins Public Service Prize; New York Times Wins 3
The Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C., with a staff of about 80 and a daily circulation of 85,000, won the most prestigious of the Pulitzer Prizes for journalism awarded on Monday, for a series on the high number of deaths resulting from domestic abuse in the state.
The series, titled “Till Death Do Us Part,” was awarded the gold medal for public service, the first Pulitzer the paper has won since 1925. It is the first time in five years that the prize has gone to such a small newspaper.
The New York Times won in the international reporting category for “courageous front-line reporting and vivid human stories” on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The newspaper’s coverage was the result of an expansive and dangerous effort. It included foreign correspondents, science writers and a video journalist (the paper’s winning entry included two online videos). The photographer Daniel Berehulak won the award for feature photography for a series of poignant portraits, shot across months, documenting Ebola’s deadly spread in West Africa.
