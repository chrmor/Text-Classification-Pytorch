Anniversary of Writer's Murder Draws Mass Protest in Turkey
ISTANBULâ€”Tens of thousands of Turks marched through central Istanbul on Thursday, mounting the country's biggest demonstration for democracy and human rights in years.
The protest marked the day five years ago when Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian writer and newspaper editor, was gunned down in broad daylight by a 17-year-old ultranationalist.
