Residents flee Perth bushfire
More than 100 people have fled their homes in Perth's east where a bushfire is burning out of control.
The blaze broke out around 9.15pm (WST) on Saturday and had burnt through about 750 hectares by mid Sunday morning.
An emergency warning remains in place for four bush-edge communities in the city of Swan.
Around 150 firefighters assisted by five helicopters are battling the blaze threatening homes in Brigadoon, Baskerville, Millendon, Red Hill and Herne Hill.
Many residents evacuated overnight with 158 registering at a relocation centre at nearby Midvale.
Denise and Lorry Cole were among those watching the fire's progress down a bushclad ridge from a police roadblock on Sunday morning, unable to return until given the the all-clear.
