Cyclone Nathan preparations under way
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says preparations are well under way as the state's far north braces for the arrival of Cyclone Nathan.
Ms Palaszczuk says the cyclone, which on Thursday morning was about 300km north northeast of Cooktown, was expected to hit the coast between Cooktown and Cape Melville as a category four system about 2am on Friday.
"Can I please stress to everyone this is a serious situation, but we do have the rest of the day to prepare," Ms Palaszczuk said from the state's emergency services headquarters in Brisbane on Thursday.
"The other good news is that we do not expect it to coincide with high tide."
