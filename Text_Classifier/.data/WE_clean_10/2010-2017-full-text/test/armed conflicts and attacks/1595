Fresh diplomatic efforts target Syria
"I think the message is clear: that the killing and the violence must stop," said Kofi Annan, the joint special envoy on Syria, to reporters here. "Humanitarian agencies must be given access to do their work, and it is regrettable that that doesn't seem to be happening. That is not happening."
He did not specify with whom he would meet or when the meetings would take place. "As you can imagine," he said, "in this type of situation, every move is sensitive and highly political, even the itinerary. But we are working it out, and I would expect to get to Syria fairly soon."
He said that if his mission is to succeed, "it is extremely important that we all accept that there should be one process of mediation -- the one both the United Nations and the Arab League have asked me to lead. When you have more than one, and people take their own initiatives, the parties play with the mediators."
Annan said he had not been in contact with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "for a couple of years," but said he would "plead with him that he should engage -- not only with me but with the process we are launching today."
The intense shelling made it difficult for the citizen journalists among Syria's opposition to take videos and post them on YouTube documenting the day's events, they said. With electricity to the city cut, activists said they were using generators to power the computers they were using to upload the few videos they were able to shoot.
"I think people have been putting forth the argument, but I also think from long experience that could complicate a resolution of a difficult, complex situation because it limits options to persuade leaders, perhaps, to step down from power," Clinton said Tuesday.
