TV ratings - 19 May: Ken Clarke detains 3 million on Question Time
A Question Time special featuring the embattled justice secretary, Ken Clarke, and filmed at Wormwood Scrubs prison proved a minor breakout hit for BBC1 with 3 million viewers.
The show, which for the first time included prisoners among the members of the Question Time audience, drew a 23.4% share of the audience between 10.35pm and 11.35pm, according to overnight figures.
The show, which saw Clarke attempt to further explain his controversial remarks on rape sentencing, won its slot between 10.35pm and 11.35pm and was ahead of the 2.8 million who watched last week's edition of the show.
Question Time, which also featured panellists including columnist Melanie Phillips, Liberty director Shami Chakrabati and former justice secretary Jack Straw, beat a repeat of Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV1.
The Morgan show featuring the former deputy prime minister John Prescott, drew 1 million viewers from 10.35pm.
Question Time beat another high-profile edition of the show in January this year which pitted former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell against maverick politician George Galloway. That show attracted 2.8 million viewers and a 21.3% share.
