Who's Googling WikiLeaks The Most? (PICTURES)
Our attention has been riveted on everything and anything WikiLeaks.
And why not? It's been one compelling, drama-filled event after another: first the contents of the cables themselves--littered with colorful diplomatic name calling, among other revelations--followed by the manhunt for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over acondom mishap, then a slew of cyber attacks targeted a big name brands like MasterCard, Visa, and Amazon.
It seems, based on the number of Google searches, that there is one part of the United States that's been watching particularly closely.
According to to Google Insights, which shows search patterns, Virginia has been Googling "WikiLeaks" more than any other state in the U.S.
Interestingly, those searches appear to be emanating from a very specific part of Virginia: an area that includes Herndon, Sterling, Ashburn, and Washington, which are home to a cluster of intelligence and defense agencies, including theCentral Intelligence Agency.
