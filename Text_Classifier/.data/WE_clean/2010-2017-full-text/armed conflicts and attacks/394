Benjamin Netanyahu to testify at Gaza flotilla raid inquiry
He will be the first of three top officials to give sworn testimony about the May 31 incident in which naval commandos stormed six aid ships trying to run the blockade on Gaza, killing the activists and wounding scores of others.
The bloody raid caused a diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey and sparked global calls for an inquiry - prompting Mr Netanyahu's government to set up the Tirkel Commission to look into the legality of the operation.
But Mr Netanyahu is not likely to face any awkward questions when he takes to the stand to testify before the five panel members, two foreign observers and hundreds of members of the press and public.
When the committee was created in June, Mr Netanyahu's office said its mandate was to examine the international legality of Israel's naval blockade and of actions taken to enforce it, as well as the actions of those who organised and took part in the flotilla.
Panel members are not authorised probe the decision-making process which led up to the operation, nor do they have the authority to question troops involved in storming the boats.
And some of the premier's testimony is expected to be delivered behind closed doors, a spokesman for the commission said on Sunday.
Defence Minister Ehud Barak will take the stand on Tuesday, followed by Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi on Wednesday, with both likely to be questioned over the operational aspects of boarding the ships.
The five-man panel, headed by retired judge Yaakov Tirkel, began investigating the raid at the end of June, and its deliberations are being monitored by two international observers.
The creation of the panel, its members and its mandate were all backed by Israel's cabinet. Its findings will be presented to the government, which has already blamed the bloodshed on the activists.
