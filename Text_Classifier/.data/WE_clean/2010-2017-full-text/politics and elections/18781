SMC Wins. Miro Cerar Probably New PM
The newcomer party of jurist Miro Cerar emerged as the landslide winner of Sunday's snap parliamentary election in Slovenia, capitalising on a desire for change in politics after the collapse of the third government in less than three years.
Seven parties have made it to parliament, including a coalition of radical left parties, while the People's Party (SLS) has failed to make it after 24 years in parliament.
With around 99.94 of the ballots counted by the National Electoral Commission, the SMC has 34.61% of the vote and 36 seats, ahead of the second-placed Democratic Party (SDS) with 20.69% and 21 seats in the 90-strong National Assembly.
The Pensioners' Party (DeSUS) has come in third with 10.21% (10 seats), while the United Left, a coalition of several leftist parties and movements, has secured 5.97% of the vote and six seats as the biggest surprise of the election.
The Social Democrats (SD) follow in fifth place with SD 5.95% and six seats in what is its worst-ever result.
Rounding out the parliament are New Slovenia (NSi) with 5.54% (5 seats) and the Alliance of Alenka Bratu≈°ek (ZaAB) with 4.34% (4 seats).
The People's Party (SLS), however, has managed to garner only 3.98%, not enough to make it to parliament.
Since the oldest Slovenian parliamentary party misses just 0.02% to get to parliament, votes arriving by mail from around Slovenia and abroad could still change the final outcome.
The other of a total of 17 parties vying for seats in parliament are far below the parliament threshold.
Aside from the SLS, the currently ruling Positive Slovenia (PS; 2.96%) and the Citizens' List (DL; 0.63%) have failed to get re-elected.
