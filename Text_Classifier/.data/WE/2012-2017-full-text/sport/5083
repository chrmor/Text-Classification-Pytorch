ICC Women’s World Cup 2013: Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs in final to win tournament
Australia registered their sixth championship victory after beating West Indies by 114 runs in the final match of the 2013 ICC Women’s World Cup in Mumbai on Sunday.
Needing 260 to win, West Indies began slowly scoring only 32 runs in their first 10 overs. They soon struggled against the pace bowling of Ellyse Perry who struck thrice in her first three overs.
The West Indians also found it tough to score runs off all-rounder Lisa Sthalekar off-spin as she gave away just 20 runs off her 10 overs picking up two crucial wickets.
West Indies, the surprise finalists of the tournament, defeated Australia in their previous encounter in the Super Six stage to qualify for the final. However, they were undone against the quality performance of the tournament favourites.
None of the West Indian players could put up a fight with the bat against some discpline bowling of the Australians. Skipper Merissa Aguilleira was the top-scorer for West Indies scoring 23 runs.
Earlier, Rachel Haynes (52) and Jessica Cameron (75) scored half-centuries up the order, before the West Indies triggered a middle-order collapse. But captain Jodie Fields (36 not out) and Ellyse Perry (25 not out) came to the rescue lower down the order and put on 50 runs in the last six overs to give their bowlers a defendable total. For the West Indies, leggie Shaquana Quintyne (three for 27) was the pick of the bowlers. Brief Scores: Australia 259 for 7 in 50 overs (Jessica Cameron 75, Rachel Haynes 52; Shaquana Quintyne 3 for 27) beatWest Indies145 all-out in 43.1 overs (Merissa Aguilleira 23; Ellyse Perry 3 for 19, Lisa Sthalekar 2 for 20) by 114 runs.
