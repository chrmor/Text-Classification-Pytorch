Senate passes resolution calling on Hosni Mubarak to begin transfer of power in Egypt
The Senate on Thursday passed a resolution supporting democracy in Egypt and calling on President Hosni Mubarak to begin the process of transferring power and creating a caretaker government as attacks on anti-government protesters entered their second day.
The resolution, sponsored by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), passed Thursday evening by unanimous voice vote. It calls on Mubarak "to immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system, including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government, in coordination with leaders from Egypt's opposition, civil society, and military, to enact the necessary reforms to hold free, fair, and internationally credible elections this year."
The resolution also "strongly condemns the intimidation, targeting or detention of journalists," calls on all parties to "refrain from all violent and criminal acts," and "expresses deep concern over any organization that espouses an extremist ideology, including the Muslim Brotherhood."
In a statement Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said, "The Egyptian people have sent a clear message that it is time for change. The Senate heard that message, and we will continue support the people of Egypt as they determine their future."
Earlier Thursday, Kerry emphasized that the resolution does not specify whether or not Mubarak should be part of a caretaker government and noted that the choice remains up to the Egyptian people.
"We want them to make that kind of choice and not narrow the options here," Kerry said. "But the key here is to respect people's rights, to end the violence, to provide an opportunity for this transfer, and to begin to pull Egypt out of this chaotic confrontation and begin to embrace the aspirations of the people."
