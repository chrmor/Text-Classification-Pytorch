Sierra Leone Declared Free of Ebola Transmissions
DAKAR, Senegal — After a nerve-racking countdown, Sierra Leone celebrated a national milestone on Saturday that government officials hoped would help the country finally leave behind a grim chapter in its history: It was officially declared free of Ebola transmissions.
The World Health Organization made the announcement at an official ceremony in Freetown, the capital, after the nation had passed 42 days, or two incubation periods for the virus, without an Ebola case.
The news marks a joyous but tense moment in Sierra Leone, where Ebola has crippled the nation’s economy and officials worry the virus could re-emerge at any moment. Saturday’s ceremony was broadcast on radio and television stations across the country and included an emotional story from an Ebola response worker who survived being infected with the virus.
“It’s kind of like a mixed emotion,” said Tunis Yahya, director of communications for the country’s National Ebola Response Center, speaking by phone from the official ceremony, attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma. “People are happy, but also many are depressed because they lost their families.”
