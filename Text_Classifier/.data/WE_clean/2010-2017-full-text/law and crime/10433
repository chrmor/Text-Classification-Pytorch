Gilani held guilty of contempt but will not be arrested
Ahead of that important judgement, PM Gilani's lawyer Mr Aitzaz Ahsan said, "This is an important day. Today the court will decide and whatever decision it takes, PM Gilani will accept that happily even if the court awards punishment. Court can acquit, it can punish also. If there is a punishment, some people will consider this a historical verdict. PM to remain in office even after adverse verdict".
