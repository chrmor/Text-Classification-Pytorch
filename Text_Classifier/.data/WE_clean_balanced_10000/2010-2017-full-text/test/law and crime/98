Video: Bangladeshi blogger who criticised Islam hacked to death
Police say assailants entered an apartment building posing as potential tenants and killed a secular blogger in Bangladesh's capital, in thefourth such deadly attack this year.
Police official Mustafizur Rahman said 40-year-old Niloy Chowdhury was killed in his apartment on Friday. The motive was not immediately clear and no one claimed responsibility for the death.
Mr Chowdhury's friends said he was a secular blogger and had a Facebook account with the name "Niloy Neel" in which he criticised radical Islamists at home and abroad.
The killing is the fourth of a secular blogger since February, when a Bangladeshi-American who was also critical of Islam was hacked to death on a street in Dhaka.
