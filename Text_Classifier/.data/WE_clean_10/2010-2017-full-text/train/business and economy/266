Global Shares Drop as Traders Watch ‘Brexit’ Vote
“I would say your real money investors, someone wanting to get hold of pounds for business reasons, would not be participating in the markets today because of the volatility,” said Kymberly Martin, a senior market strategist at BNZ Markets. “The volumes trading are quite small and contributing to the large moves that are happening.”
But Ms. Martin said the pound could fall even further than it already has.
The Vix index of volatility shot up early on Friday in Asia, and is up about 15.5 percent.
FTSE 100 index futures have plunged again and are down more than 5 percent, indicating that London blue-chip stocks will open much lower on Friday. Gold, a haven asset, is up almost 2 percent.
