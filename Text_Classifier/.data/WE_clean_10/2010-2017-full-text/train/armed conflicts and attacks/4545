Spain rejects ETA ceasefire offer
Spanish officials have rejected the latest statement by the Basque separatist group ETA that it is ready to observe a permanent ceasefire in its battle for an independent homeland.
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero made no mention of the ETA statement at a rally in Zaragoza on Sunday, but a government source quoted by the website of the daily El Mundo dismissed it as a "waste of time".
"The only thing we're waiting for is a final end to violence," the source added.
Basque regional president Patxi Lopez, who belongs to Zapatero's ruling socialists, said he saw "nothing new" in the latest ETA statement, made by two members of the group in an interview published on Sunday in Basque daily Gara.
"The development we are all waiting for and which we have repeated time and again to ETA is the announcement of its disappearance," he told Spanish media on his arrival in China where he was to visit the World Expo in Shanghai.
Asked if ETA would be willing to commit to a "permanent and verifiable ceasefire", the two members of the outfit told Gara: "ETA is willing to take that step and also to go further if the conditions for it are created."
