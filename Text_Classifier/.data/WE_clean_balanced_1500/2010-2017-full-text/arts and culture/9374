Eight Egyptian mummies unearthed in tomb
Eight mummies, colourful coffins and more than 1000 funerary statues have been found at a tomb near the Valley of the Kings in Luxor in Egypt.
The artefacts, thought to be at least 3000 years old, were discovered in the tomb in the Draa Abul Nagaa necropolis nearby.
It belonged to a nobleman who worked as a judge.
"It was a surprise how much was being displayed inside", Egypt's antiquities minister Khaled el-Enany said.
Spokeswoman Nevine el-Aref said there was "evidence and traces that new mummies could be discovered in the future".
The coffins were well-preserved, painted in red, blue, black, green, and yellow.
The statues found among the relics were traditionally placed alongside the dead to help them in the afterlife.
A statement released by the ministry said the tomb was T-shaped, with "an open court leading into a rectangular hall, a corridor and an inner chamber".
The statues were found inside a 9m shaft. Another room that was found has not been excavated yet.
