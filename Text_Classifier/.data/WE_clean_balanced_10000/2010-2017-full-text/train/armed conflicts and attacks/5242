U.N. helicopters fire on Gbagbo army camp -witnesses
ABIDJAN, April 4 (Reuters) - United Nations helicopters fired four missiles at a pro-Gbagbo military camp in Ivory Coast’s main city of Abidjan on Monday, witnesses said.
“We saw two UNOCI (U.N. mission in Ivory Coast) MI-24 helicopters fire missiles on the Akouedo military camp. There was a massive explosion and we can still see the smoke,” one of the witnesses said.
The camp is home to three battalions of the Ivorian army.
Calls to the U.N. forces commander in Ivory Coast went unanswered. (Reporting by Ange Aboa; Writing Bate Felix; Editing by Louise Ireland)
