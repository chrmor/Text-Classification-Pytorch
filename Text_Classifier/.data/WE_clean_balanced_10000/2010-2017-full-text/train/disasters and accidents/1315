Firefighters battle 10-alarm blaze in Cambridge, Massachusetts
The fire was initially reported as a 9-alarm blaze, but a 10th alarm went out on Saturday afternoon, the Cambridge Police tweeted. 
According to CBS Boston, two police officers and one firefighter were injured in the fire. 
Cambridge police spokesman Jeremy Warnick says there have been some injuries reported but none of them are serious. He says the city has opened up a nearby youth center for families displaced from their homes. 
A plume of smoke could be seen for miles. Fire crews were called in from surrounding cities and towns. 
Flames have extended to as many as seven buildings in the area. The building where the fire is believed to have started has collapsed. According to the fire chief, there was construction happening near that building. One of the buildings engulfed in flames is an old church that has been converted to apartment buildings.
Fire was shooting through the roofs of multiple structures.
The fire was reported just before 3 p.m. and reached nine alarms about 30 minutes later. It is not clear exactly where the fire began, but smoke could be seen throughout Boston billowing from the Cambridge buildings.
Firefighters have been called in from Newton, Waltham, Wakefield, and multiple other towns. Eversource said 782 customers are without power due to the fire.
