Some passengers on MH17 may have been conscious as plane plummeted to ground
Some passengers aboard Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 may have been conscious as the plane plummeted to earth after being hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, the final report into the aviation disaster has confirmed.
The Dutch Safety Board has released its final report into the July 17, 2014 crash, which killed all 298 people on board, including 38 Australians.
The BUK missile approached the aircraft just above the left-hand side of the cockpit, before its detonation sent shrapnel tearing through the front section of the plane.
All three crew members were killed instantly and the cockpit separated from the rear of the plane, exposing the surviving passengers to "extreme conditions".
"The forward section of the aircraft was penetrated by hundreds of high-energy objects coming from the warhead," the report said.
"As a result of the impact and the subsequent blast, the three crew members in the cockpit were killed immediately and the aeroplane broke up in the air."
The report found most of the remaining passengers would have lost consciousness as the plane plunged from 33,000 feet, but some may have been alert during the horrific 90 second descent to the ground.
"It cannot be ruled out that some occupants remained conscious for some time during the one to one-and-a-half minutes for which the crash lasted," the report said.
Overnight, around 200 journalists were shown into a large temporary hall at the air base where part of the plane's cockpit and business class section had been reconstructed from wreckage retrieved from Ukraine.
Torn and pitted pieces of the outer skin of the fuselage in the red, white and blue colours of the airline were pinned to a metal frame in the shape of the plane, with some windows and part of the airline logo intact.
The safety board, which is the Dutch transport watchdog, has made it clear it is not concerned with blame or liability as those are matters for the separate criminal investigation, which is due to issue its report in several months' time.
Dutch Safety Board chairman Tjibbe Joustra criticised Ukraine and other authorities for a failure to recognise the risk of flying in airspace above a warzone.
Pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian authorities were in the midst of intense fighting on the ground when MH17 was hit by the missile.
Although nobody thought that civil aviation was at risk, there was sufficient reason for Ukraine authorities to close the airspace, Mr Joustra said.
Kiev and the West have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane with a surface-to air missile supplied by Russia, but Moscow and the rebels deny any responsibility and point the finger at Ukraine's military.
Both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries have BUK missiles in their arsenals.
In July, Russia vetoed a bid at the United Nations Security Council to set up an international tribunal to try those behind the downing of the aircraft.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia remained committed to finding justice for the victims by holding those responsible for the disaster to account.
