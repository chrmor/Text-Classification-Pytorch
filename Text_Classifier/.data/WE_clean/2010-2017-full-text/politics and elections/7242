Brazil's Rousseff accepts aide resignation -source
BRASILIA, June 7 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has accepted the resignation of her chief of staff Antonio Palocci, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday.
Palocci offered his resignation as one of Rousseffâ€™s most influential aides after a leading newspaper reported last month that he increased his personal wealth 20-fold as a corporate consultant while serving in Congress.
