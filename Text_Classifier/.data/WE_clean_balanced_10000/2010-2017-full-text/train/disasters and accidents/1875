Europe death toll now 400 from icy weather
Icebreakers have battled Europe's big chill as the Danube river froze over more than 170km, and dozens died of cold on a continent gripped by some of the lowest temperatures in decades.
The overall death toll from the cold snap that began 11 days ago topped 400 while forecasters warned there would be no early let-up to the freezing weather.
In Serbia, icebreakers were summoned from Hungary in an attempt to keep the Danube flowing, while army demolition experts sought to dynamite ice barriers that threatened to provoke flooding on tributary rivers.
The Danube, one of Europe's main rivers, was barely navigable around Belgrade and the port authority in Veliko Gradiste, near the Romanian and Bulgarian border, said river traffic was blocked along a 170km stretch.
"I have some 30 vessels blocked in Veliko Gradiste," an official said.
In Bulgaria the Danube exploration agency said icing was at 20 per cent near the Serbian border and up to 80 per cent along a 220km stretch between the ports of Nikopol and Silistra further down river.
