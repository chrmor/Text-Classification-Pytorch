Cate Blanchett wins lead actress
"You already decide when Woody calls that you're going to do it, but I went through the charade and said, 'Absolutely. I'd love to read it,'" Blanchett, 44, told The Times last year. "So he sent it, and I was just gob-smacked. He asked me to call him as soon as I read it, which I did the next day, and then it was a really short call. You could count the seconds. 'See you in San Francisco. Thank you.'"
