Lubbock man killed in Israel stabbing rampage
A West Point graduate from Lubbock died after he was stabbed while on a trip to Israel in an attack that wounded at least 10 others.
Taylor Force, a graduate student at Vanderbilt University, was killed on Tuesday near the port of Jaffa.
"This horrific act of violence has robbed our Vanderbilt family of a young hopeful life and all of the bright promise that he held for bettering our greater world," Vanderbilt University chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos said in a statement.
The school said Force was on a university business school trip to study global entrepreneurship and learn about start-ups in Israel.
"All other Vanderbilt students, faculty and staff on the trip are safe," Zeppos said.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, tweeted a message of support about Force: "May his memory be a blessing," he wrote.
The attack happened near the time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived at the Peres Center for Peace, about a mile away.
The Jerusalem Post said the assailant was a 22-year-old Palestinian. He escaped on foot after the attack, running between cars stopped on the road and stabbing motorists. He wounded a number of people before he was shot and subdued by Israeli police, the Jerusalem Post reported.
According to his LinkedIn page, Force graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2009 with a degree in engineering and industrial management. He was commissioned into the field artillery and served more than five years in the Army, with deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.
