Health union chief refuses to step down as union quits ALP
A civil war has broken out in the Health Services Union after president Michael Williamson refused to step down after a union meeting today in the wake of a police probe into alleged "inappropriate practices".
There are deep divisions within the union following a meeting, via telephone, of delegates of the HSU East branch today, which resolved to disaffiliate from the ALP in NSW and Victoria.
NSW Labor Party general secretary Sam Dastyari said on Twitter that he had been notified of the development.
"I have just been notified that the HSU have just disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Party," Mr Dastyari tweeted.
But Mr Williamson did not show at a union press conference after the decision was made.
