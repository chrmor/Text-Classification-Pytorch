Flooding Rain Still a Risk as Barry Diminishes
Barry will continue to bring torrential rain, the risk of flooding and the potential for mudslides as it drifts inland and weakens over Mexico Thursday night and Friday.
States in Mexico that could receive flooding downpours include Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, and southern Tamaulipas.
The system drifted over the warm waters of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Bay of Campeche) Tuesday night into early Wednesday. The warm water provided enough fuel for the depression to become Tropical Storm Barry prior to landfall.
Earlier this week, Belize City had received nearly 9.5 inches of rain from the system. Since Wednesday evening, approximately 5 inches of rain has fallen on the city of Veracruz the same name as the Mexican state.
A general 4 to 8 inches of rain is forecast in the vicinity with local amounts of a foot.
Indications continue to suggest that the bulk of the rain will stay south of much of Texas. There is a chance that some leftover moisture will be funneled up toward the Big Bend area and into part of western Texas toward the weekend.
"Interestingly, the same parent tropical wave that produced the Atlantic tropical depression could spin up a much stronger system over the Eastern Pacific Basin by next week," Kottlowski said.
That feature could bring torrential rainfall and gusty thunderstorms along part of Mexico's southern coast, perhaps in the vicinity of Acapulco for a day or two, before moving westward into the open Pacific.
Another strong tropical wave is moving westward through the Caribbean this week. Drenching showers and locally gusty thunderstorms will affect Hispaniola Thursday night and Friday, then parts of the Bahamas, Cuba and South Florida this weekend.
"Strong upper-level winds and a weak circulation will inhibit development with this system," Kottlowski said.
