Dalai Lama quits politics, focus now on successor
DHARAMSHALA: In a historic decision that sent ripples from Dharamshala to Beijing through Delhi, the 14th Dalai Lama on Thursday decided to give up his political role and shift all temporal power to the prime minister elected by the Tibetan community in exile. The announcement, made at the Tsgulakhang temple here, marks a dramatic shift in Tibetan politics as the Dalai Lamas have served as both the spiritual and the political head of the Tibetan people — god-king, in short — since the mid-17th century. For long, the Dalai Lama has talked about handing over political power to the exile government. But this time the 76-year-old leader has laid down a timeline. The Dalai Lama's proposal will be discussed by the Tibetan parliament on March 14. If approved, the Kalon Tripa (prime minister of the government-in-exile) will inherit the Dalai Lama's political powers. The Dalai Lama's stepping down is likely to trigger an electoral contest for the prime minister's post between three front-runners, all based abroad. They are Lobsang Sangay, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School, Tenzing Namgyal Tethong, an academic at Stanford University, and Tashi Wangdi, a Brussels-based civil servant. The election is scheduled for March 20. Thursday's development also brought attention on the awkward relationship between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities. Not surprisingly, the announcement was met with derision in Beijing. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said that the Dalai Lama had often talked about retirement in the past few years. "I think these are his tricks to deceive the international community. The government-in-exile is an illegal political organization and no country in the world recognizes it,'' she told reporters. In his speech on the 52nd anniversary of the failed 1959 Lhasa uprising, the Dalai Lama said, ''As early as the 1960s, I have repeatedly stressed that Tibetans need a leader, elected freely by the Tibetan people, to whom I can devolve power. Now, we have clearly reached the time to put this into effect. During the forthcoming 11th session of the 14th Tibetan Parliament in exile, which begins on 14th March, I will formally propose that the necessary amendments be made to the Charter for Tibetans in exile, reflecting my decision to devolve my formal authority to the elected leader.'' Nobel Peace Prize winner, the Dalai Lama currently presides over Parliament-in-exile meetings. During Thursday's ceremony, attended by many foreign journalists, he also said that many of his supporters had asked him not to retire. "My desire to devolve authority has nothing to do with a wish to shirk responsibility. It is to benefit Tibetans in the long run," he said. Speaking to reporters immediately after the announcement, Samdhong Rinpoche, the current Prime Minister, entreated the Dalai Lama to stay on. "Despite His Holiness' request, the people and the government do not feel competent to lead ourselves. We beseech His Holiness to continue to lead us until we attain liberation," an emotional Rinpoche said. The feelings on the ground were mixed. Lopsang Thupten, a Tibetan in his early 20s said, "The Dalai Lama's retirement might discourage a lot of Tibetans. We can elect a Kalon Tripa. But the Dalai Lama's place is very special." However, Dorje Chuki, a 24-year-old nursing student said, "It's ok if His Holiness wants to retire. He is old now, and has a lot of work. He needs rest too." The current Dalai Lama has indicated his successor would come from the exile community. Beijing, though, insists the reincarnation must be found in China's Tibetan areas giving the communist authorities immense power over who is chosen. The Dalai Lama's decision to call it a day has an important lesson for Indian politicians — retirement. At 76, the Tibetan leader, with a global following well beyond the Buddhists, is at an age when most netas would be hanging on to power using every trick in the book. Seniority isn't a disability. But those ruling for decades should think of stepping aside to allow the younger generation to take up public office and bring — hopefully — greater idealism and higher energy.
