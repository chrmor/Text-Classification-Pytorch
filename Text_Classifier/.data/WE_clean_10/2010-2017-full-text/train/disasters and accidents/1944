Nation put under year's first heat wave advisory
SEOUL, June 20 (Yonhap) -- The state weather agency on Monday issued a heat wave advisory for the first time this year with the nation exhausted by sweltering heat over the past week.   Seoul's daytime high is expected to top 33 C on Monday, following the previous day's high of 32.9 C, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The mercury of other inland cities, including Suwon and Chuncheon, is also forecast to surge to over 33 C, said the KMA.   The KMA predicted the sweltering heat would continue across the country on Tuesday with the central part of the country experiencing especially high temperatures.   Heat wave advisories are issued when the temperature goes over 33 C and continues for at least two days. When the afternoon high goes up to 35 C and lasts for two days, the KMA issues a heat wave warning.   Following the KMA's alert, the government announced a set of guidelines to prevent heat-related illnesses and damage, officials said.   The state disaster management agency should be equipped with ice packs and ice vests and the health ministry will visit or call the elderly who live alone or have physical challenges.   The labor ministry should instruct firms and companies to pay attention to their workers who are vulnerable to hot weather and to urge their workers in construction sites to take a break in the afternoon.   Schools are required to limit students from outdoor activities and are recommended to close when a heat wave warning is issued, they said.   The KMA said that rain is expected in the central region on Wednesday and the whole nation from Thursday as a seasonal rainy front is moving northward.   "The rainy front will travel northward on Wednesday to affect Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, and then the rain will hit the country between June 23 and 26," said a KMA official.   brk@yna.co.kr (END)
