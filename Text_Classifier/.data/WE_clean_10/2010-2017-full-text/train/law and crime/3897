Situation calm in Darwin protest
Four Afghan asylum seekers have been hospitalised with dehydration after pushing down a fence at the Darwin detention centre to stage a protest.
Immigration Minister Chris Evans said 92 Afghan males escaped the centre early on Wednesday morning and pushed over a fence.
"All the persons involved are asylum seekers and many of them have actually had their initial claim for asylum refused, and there's is a protest activity," Senator Evans told reporters in Canberra.
The protest was peaceful and the "situation is calm" but the asylum seekers could face criminal charges.
"I want to make it clear that escaping from detention and damaging detention property is a criminal offence," Senator Evans said.
"People may well be charged."
