Africa Cup of Nations 2012: Ivory Coast on Verge of a Perfect Tournament
The Ivory Coast will easily handle Zambia and cap off an impressive and thoroughly dominant Africa Cup of Nations.
They started off this tournament as the favorites, and they will end as champions. And despite not quite achieving their ultimate goal, this has still been a successful run. 
Unlike their upcoming opponents, Zambia was not expected to contend for this title. They have paved an upset path to reach the finals, but they simply don't have the talent to seal the deal. 
The elephants are a perfect 5-0 in this tournament, but that is not their only perfect number. They have yet to allow a goal while netting nine of their own. 
They have a talented front line and an impressive defense. Drogba has been leading the goal scoring charge, and he is joined by fellow Premier League players Gervinho, Yaya and Kolo Toure. 
The fact that they are pitching a tournament shutout puts them in rare company. Only two other sides have won this tournament without yielding a goal. 
Cameroon accomplished the feat in 2002, and the Ivory Coast did so in 1992, which is their only Africa's Cup winning run.
This talented team is going to overwhelm Zambia. They will be able to control possession, keep the ball on Zambia's side of the field and dictate the tempo.
