TOKYO—Sony Corp. reported quarterly earnings that exceeded market expectations, suggesting the company’s recovery is on track after years of losses with the help of its strong-performing videogame business.
For the quarter ending Sept. 30, the entertainment and electronics company recorded a net profit of ¥33.6 billion ($278.2 million), beating market expectations for a ¥26.4 billion net profit. In the same period a year earlier, it marked a loss of ¥136 billion as it wrote down the value of its loss-making smartphone arm.
