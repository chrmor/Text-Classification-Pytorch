Bubba Watson wins US Masters
American Bubba Watson has captured his second US Masters title in three years with victory at Augusta National on Sunday.
The 2012 champion carded a final round of 69 to finish at eight-under - three shots clear of debutants Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt.
Spieth had a two-stroke lead heading to the eighth hole, but Watson turned things around with back-to-back birdies while Spieth slipped with two straight bogeys.
The 35-year-old stretched his lead at the 13th with a booming drive to set up a two-putt birdie, taking his score to eight-under.
