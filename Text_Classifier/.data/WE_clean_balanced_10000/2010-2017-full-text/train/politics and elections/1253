Serra and his supporters then closed the rally singing the national anthem.This Sunday, Serra will vote in Sao Paulo, where he will then await the election results, while Rousseff will cast her ballot in the southern city of Porto Alegre.After voting, Rousseff will fly to Brasilia to follow election results with Lula at the Alvorada Palace, the official presidential residence, as she did during the first round of voting on Oct. 3.In that first contest, the PT candidate came out on top with 46.9 percent of the vote, but did not get the majority required and was forced to dispute this Sunday�s runoff against Serra, who in the first round got 32.6 percent.The authorities finished Saturday installing the close to 400,000 electronic voting machines that will be available to Brazil�s 135.8 million eligible voters, while the army has sent a total of 4,000 troops to the 149 cities that asked for help in beefing up security for the electoral process.Also on Sunday, coinciding with the presidential election, will be the second round of gubernatorial elections in the states of Alagoas, Rondonia, Goias, Para, Paraiba, Piaui, Amapa, Roraima and the Brasilia Federal District, where last Oct. 3 none of the candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote.
