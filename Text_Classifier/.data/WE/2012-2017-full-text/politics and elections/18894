Obama, Biden endorse Kamala Harris for U.S. Senate
A San Diego-area businessman who filed papers seeking referenda to overturn six gun control laws said Saturday that he is part of a group of up to 100 activists who feel the measures were rushed through without considering public opinion.
Barry Bahrami said he realizes it will be difficult to collect 365,000 signatures on each of the six referendum petitions in the next two and a half months, but said opponents of the laws are serious about trying.
"The only certainty is that it's an impossible challenge if we don't at least try," Bahrami wrote in an email to reporters. "By my math we can do it if we hustle.  We have more than two thousand gun stores in this state.  We will be leveraging these gun stores and numerous volunteers from the communities to get the petitions signed."
