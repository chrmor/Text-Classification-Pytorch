Cannes film festival suffers $1m jewellery theft
More than $1m (Â£650,000) worth of jewels have been stolen from a hotel in the French town of Cannes, police say.
The jewels were to be loaned to celebrities who have arrived on the French Riviera for the famous annual film festival.
They were stolen from a safe in the Novotel Hotel room of an employee of exclusive Swiss jeweller Chopard.
Chopard is one of the official sponsors of the festival, which opened on Wednesday.
Hugh Schofield in Paris reports on what he said appears to have been a classic Riviera heist.
