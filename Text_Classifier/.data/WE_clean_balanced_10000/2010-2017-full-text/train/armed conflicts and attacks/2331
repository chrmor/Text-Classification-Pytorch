Intelligence officials say suspected US missile strike kills 4 militants in northwest Pakistan
PARACHINAR, Pakistan (AP) â€” Suspected U.S. missiles struck two vehicles carrying militants in northwest Pakistan, killing four of them, intelligence officials said Saturday.
The overnight attack happened in the Kurram tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The slain men were from Taliban's Haqqani network, which is blamed for launching attacks across the border against the American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, one of the three intelligence officials said.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
Although the CIA has repeatedly targeted militant positions in Pakistan's tribal regions, such strikes in Kurram are rare.
