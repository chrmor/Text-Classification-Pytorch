Household Worker Trips Up Britain’s Immigration Minister
LONDON — The British immigration minister has resigned after revealing that his house cleaner of six years was living in the country illegally.
Apologizing for the “embarrassment,” the minister, Mark Harper, stepped down on Saturday after submitting a resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron.
Mr. Harper, who had been leading a crackdown on illegal immigration in Britain, was an important part of a “go home” campaign, which included posters pasted on vans across the country encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country. One commentator in The Telegraph suggested that Mr. Harper, as the public face of the campaign, should have “gone home and checked that his cleaner was squeaky clean and eligible to work in the U.K.”
Immigration is an increasingly fractious issue in Britain. In 2010, Mr. Cameron pledged to reduce the number of new immigrants “by tens of thousands” by 2015, from the 200,000 a year expected under current trends. He is facing pressure from his Conservative Party as well as from the U.K. Independence Party, which is anti-immigrant and anti-European Union. The Independence Party is expected to gain traction in European parliamentary elections this year.
