Tymoshenko criticizes monetary emission policy - Oct. 20, 2010
"The economy is not just philosophy, it is strict mathematics. If the issue is more than Hr 80 billion, at the end of the day, we’ll get inflation that will effectively be uncontrollable. This is the rule – By switching on the [money] printing press, the country could get into such an uncontrollable condition, that it won’t be able to get out of it," she said at a press conference in Chernihiv on Wednesday.
Tymoshenko said that as a result of the monetary emission and inflationary growth, the problem of national currency stability will become acute.
"The next thing could be the hryvnia… it will depreciate, I believe, after the election. Most likely they [the government] will lose all levers, both for tariffs and control over the hryvnia’s stability – and there will be a lot of bolts from the blue after the election," she said.
"Economic collapse means an ignorant financial and economic policy, and this [results from] the deep, systematic unprofessionalism of the current team that has come to power. A professional from a government financial and economic team would perhaps have shed bitter tears because of a lack of money, but would have never touched the printing press – as a professional is well aware that this is an atomic bomb," she said.
As reported earlier, in 2009, the members of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko suggested permitting a limited emission of money to combat the crisis, such as done by the leading nations’ central banks. Moreover, Tymoshenko, who headed the government then, criticized the National Bank of Ukraine for the refusal to finance preparations for the Euro 2012 through advanced financing by the central bank of budget expenditures.
