Enfant terrible of French literature finally wins country's top literary prize
Houellebecq, the enfant terrible of French contemporary literature accepted the Prix Goncourt at Le Drouant, the small Paris restaurant where the jury always make their final judgement over lunch.
The jury had voted seven to two in favour of his widely-acclaimed novel "La Carte et le Territoire" (The Map and the Territory) after three failed attempts over a decade.
He wins a symbolic prize of 10 euros (£8.60), but the prize is said to boost sales to around 400,000 copies in general - the book has already sold almost 200,000 copies in France.
The win comes despite accusations of plagiarism – one critic noticed at least three chunks of text were apparently the same as passages from the French-language edition of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.
"It's a bizarre sensation but I'm deeply happy", the controversial 54-year-old said of the prize previously awarded to Marcel Proust, Simone de Beauvoir and Marguerite Duras. "There are people that only know contemporary literature thanks to the Goncourt, and literature at the centre of French people's concerns, so it's significant."
Houellebecq has previously criticised the award after missing out.
When Atomised, his sexually explicit novel about two half brothers' relationships that shot him to fame in 1998, lost the Goncourt he claimed the jury were "bought off".
He complained when his next work, Platform about third-world sex tourism and terrorism, was knocked out in 2001, while in 2005, his book, The Possibility of an Island, featuring a standup comic cloned by the Rael sect, failed to make the grade, he said: "The prize system is so opaque that it is better to expect nothing from it."
Yesterday [Monday], he said however: "I'm someone who forgets bad things, the wounds have healed."
Detractors of the Goncourt have accused the jury of awarding prizes to make sure publishers share the spoils. Houellbecq's publisher, Flammarion, however, has not won the award for 30 years.
Pierre Assouline, a critic for Le Monde newspaper, wrote in his literary blog: "If the Goncourt jury had not crowned him this time, they would have looked ridiculous."
Houellebecq's latest novel, set largely in Paris, centres on a lonely misanthropic artist who wins critical and commercial success by photographing Michelin maps and then painting business tycoons.
The character befriends a grumpy writer who "stinks a little less than a corpse" and resembles "an old, sick tortoise", named Michel Houellebecq.
The writer's works have consistently sparked controversy and claims of misogyny, racism and sexism.
His description of Islam as "the most stupid religion" landed him in court in 2002 on a charge of inciting racial hatred, of which he was acquitted.
He also hit the headlines over a savage public row with his estranged mother Lucie Ceccaldi, whom he portrays in a deeply unflattering light in his novel Plateforme. She responded by writing a book in which she called him a liar, an impostor and a parasite.
Houellebecq dismissed the allegations of plagiarism, arguing that the passages were part of a "patchwork" approach that was ironic.
"If people really think that, then they haven't the first notion of what literature is. That is part of my method", he said, saying other great writers versed in the arts of mixing "real" texts into fiction.
