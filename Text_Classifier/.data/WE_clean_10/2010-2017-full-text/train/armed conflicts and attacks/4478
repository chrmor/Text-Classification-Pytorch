Soldier kills 7 comrades at Tunis barracks - ministry
Tunis - A Tunisian corporal shot dead seven of his comrades on Monday before himself being killed, the defence ministry said, adding that he had family and psychological problems.
The rampage "caused the deaths of seven soldiers and also of the shooter. Ten soldiers were wounded, and one is in a serious condition," ministry spokesperson Belhassen Oueslati said at a news conference.
"He attacked one man with a knife and took his gun before shooting at his comrades who were saluting the flag.
"He had family and psychological problems" and because of this had been "forbidden from carrying arms" and given "non-sensitive duties", Oueslati said.
He called the shooting an "isolated" incident.
"Investigations will show whether this was a terrorist act or not," Oueslati added, despite the interior ministry earlier ruling this out.
