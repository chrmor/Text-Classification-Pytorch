Sofia Coppola wins Venice Golden Lion for Somewhere
Film director Sofia Coppola has taken the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, the Golden Lion, for her film Somewhere.
The film tells the story of an actor whose aimless life is transformed when his young daughter comes to stay.
The prize for best director went to Spain's Alex de la Iglesia for his horror film, The Last Circus.
Vincent Gallo was named best actor for his role as an American Taliban in the film Essential Killing.
Coppola, 39, based Somewhere on her own upbringing as the daughter of film director Francis Ford Coppola.
"Thanks to my dad for teaching me," she said in her acceptance speech.
"This film enchanted us from its first screening," said Quentin Tarantino, chairman of the jury which unanimously chose Copppola's film as the festival's best.
Coppola's last film, Marie Antoinette, was booed at its premiere during the Cannes Film Festival four years ago.
She is best known for her 2003 film, Lost in Translation, which starred Bill Murray and made her one of only a handful of women directors to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.
Vincent Gallo, who won the prize for best actor, spent much of the Venice festival in a balaclava to escape the paparazzi. He did not appear on stage to accept his award.
The film Essential Killing, in which he plays an American Taliban captured in Afghanistan, was directed by Jerzy Skolimowski.
