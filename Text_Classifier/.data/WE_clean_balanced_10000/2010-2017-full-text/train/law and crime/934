New judges for Dutch MP hate speech trial
The judges trying Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders for hate speech were ordered to step down at his request on Friday by an independent panel of their colleagues.
Wilders' "request is granted," the president of a specially compiled panel of different judges ruled in the Amsterdam district court on Tuesday.
They said other judges would hear the rest of the case.
Wilders, 47, went on trial on October 4 for inciting hatred by calling Islam "fascist" and likening the Koran to Hitler's Mein Kampf.
His defence lawyer had earlier asked that the trial judges be removed, saying his client feared they were biased against him.
The bench had created "an impression of partiality" by putting off a decision on the defence's request to recall a witness, Wilders' lawyer Bram Moszkowicz told court.
