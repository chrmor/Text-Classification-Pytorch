Myanmar: Fire at Mosque Kills 13 Children
The police in Myanmar said 13 children died Tuesday when an electrical fire broke out at a mosque in Yangon, the country’s largest city. The fire was set off by an overheated inverter, and was not the result of any “criminal activity,” a police officer, Thet Lwin, said. Myanmar has been on edge since violence between Buddhists and Muslims erupted in Meiktila last month, killing dozens of people. The mosque in Yangon sheltered about 75 orphans, and most escaped unharmed by running out after the police forced a door open.
