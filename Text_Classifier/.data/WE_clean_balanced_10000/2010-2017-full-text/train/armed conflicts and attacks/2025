The Damascus Documents
Al Jazeera has gained access to confidential documents prepared for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by his intelligence and security chiefs on the conflict raging across the nation.
The files - passed to the network by Abdel Majid Barakat, a former member of Assad's government - provide an insight into the regime's strategy to suppress anti-government protests, including the lengths it went to protect its strongholds.
The documents, which run hundreds of pages long, reveal the establishment of what has been referred to as the Crisis Management Cell, formed to deal with the security situation.
The following are several of the documents in their original Arabic form, alongside our own English translation.
Document 1: The plan to deal with Aleppo
