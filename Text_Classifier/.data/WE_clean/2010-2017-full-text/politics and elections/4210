Tasmania's Labor caucus has elected Lara Giddings as its leader.
The 38-year-old replaces David Bartlett who quit the top job yesterday to spend more time with his young family.
Ms Giddings will continue to govern in an alliance with the Greens, who have two members in the minority government cabinet.
Former Deputy Premier Bryan Green regains the position five years after he was sent to the backbench in disgrace over the 'deals for mates' scandal involving the Tasmanian Compliance Corporation.
The jury in two Supreme Court trials could not reach a verdict and the case was dropped.
Arriving at today's meeting he acknowledged it had been a tough couple of years and said he would be happy to step back into the job.
He says he is looking forward to supporting Ms Giddings.
"She's going to be a great Premier for Tasmania and I'm looking forward to continuing the great work that David's done," Mr Green said.
Ms Giddings will speak to the media this afternoon and is expected to announce she will retain her Treasury portfolio.
She will be sworn in as Tasmania's first female Premier this afternoon.
The Speaker of the House of Assembly Michael Polley says it is a momentous day.
"Isn't it exciting to see the first woman Premier of Tasmania? I can assure you she'll do a grand job," he said.
Tasmania's peak business lobby group has endorsed the new Premier and has called on her to stay on as Treasurer to ensure continuity.
Robert Wallace from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry says Ms Giddings has been a competent and capable Treasurer.
He says she has shown an ability to get across a complex brief.
"We would certainly hope that she does retain it, certainly in the interim to make sure there is a very careful transition across," he said.
"What this state needs is strong fiscal leadership and direction and that can only come from someone extremely senior and that is certainly the position of Premier."
Health professionals are urging the new Premier to make hospital reform a major priority.
The Australian Medical Association says Ms Giddings needs to move quickly on plans to divide the state's health system into three local hospital networks.
The Association's Michael Aizen says Ms Giddings should also retain Michelle O'Byrne as Health Minister to ensure stability.
"Certainly the local hospital network is the most important and the most time urgent," he said.
"If there's a change in ministry that involves a new health minister it may in fact create some setbacks in the timetable."
