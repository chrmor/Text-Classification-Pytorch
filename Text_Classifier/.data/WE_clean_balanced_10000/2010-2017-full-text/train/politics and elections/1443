Kyrgyz Prime Minister To Resign
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Temir Sariev has announced he will resign.
The announcement on April 11 at a government meeting in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek comes after several parliament members accused his cabinet of corruption.
"Squabbles, rumors and gossip have upset the balance within the government," Sariev said.
"The government's work has stalled at such a difficult time."
The Kyrgyz presidential press service said President Almazbek Atambaev had accepted Sariev's resignation.
