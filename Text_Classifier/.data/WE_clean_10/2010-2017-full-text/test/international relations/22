(LEAD) Lee stresses alliance, N.K. denuclearization in rare Congress address
By Chang Jae-soon WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (Yonhap) -- South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Thursday highlighted the significance of the country's free-trade agreement with the United States and his commitment to end North Korea's nuclear programs as he delivered a rare address to a joint session of Congress. The speech, which came hours after Lee's summit with U.S. President Barack Obama, was organized to mark the trade deal's passage in Congress a day earlier. Lee was the first South Korean leader to speak at a joint Congressional session in 13 years after a 1998 speech by late former President Kim Dae-jung.
