Leni on ‘Poe-Robredo’ tandem: Roxas remains my partner
NAGA CITY, Philippines—Liberal Party vice presidential candidate Camarines Sur Rep. Ma. Leonor “Leni” Robredo on Thursday thanked supporters for pairing her with Senator Grace Poe but maintained that she would remain loyal to her “partner” in the race, LP standard-bearer Manuel “Mar” Roxas II.
(I would like to thank those who support my candidacy, we all know that Secretary Roxas is my partner in this race.)
“Magkasama naming sinimulan ang labang ito at magkasama rin namin itong tatapusin,” she said.
(He [Roxas] and I started this fight and we we will end this together.)
Campaign ads of “Poe-Robredo” recently surfaced on social media. On Facebook, a post in the “Poe Robredo kami” fan page said its supporters believe that only the two female candidates can beat the tandem of Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.
Robredo is currently leading the vice presidential preference surveys, rising from 1 percent at the start of the campaign to 30 percent.
