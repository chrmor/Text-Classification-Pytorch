ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government is seeking an extension of the state of emergency it declared following a failed coup in 2016.
The government submitted to parliament a motion to prolong it three more months following a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday. It would be its seventh extension.
The move comes despite widespread calls for Turkey to end the state of emergency.
A U.N. report last month said Turkey's state of emergency had led to human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and dismissals, torture and ill-treatment.
The main opposition party accuses the government of misusing its emergency powers to erode democracy and arrest government critics. Its supporters staged sit-in demonstrations Monday across Turkey to demand an end to the emergency declaration.
