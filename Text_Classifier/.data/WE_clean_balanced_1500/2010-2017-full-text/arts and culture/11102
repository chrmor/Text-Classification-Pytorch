Taiwan's oldest human fossil: mother and baby from 4,800 years ago
Archaeologists uncover extraordinary remains of mother looking down at infant in her arms
Archaeologists in Taiwan have found a 4,800-year-old human fossil of a mother holding an infant child in her arms.
The 48 sets of remains unearthed in graves in the Taichung area are the earliest trace of human activity found in central Taiwan. 
The most striking discovery among them was the skeleton of a young mother looking down at a child cradled in her arms.
“When it was unearthed, all of the archaeologists and staff members were shocked. Why? Because the mother was looking down at the baby in her hands,” said Chu Whei-lee, a curator in the Anthropology Department at Taiwan’s National Museum of Natural Science.
The excavation of the site began in May 2014 and took a year to complete. Carbon dating was used to determine the ages of the fossils, which included five children.
