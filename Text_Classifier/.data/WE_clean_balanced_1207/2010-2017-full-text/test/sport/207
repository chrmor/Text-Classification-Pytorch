MONTREAL â€” Troy Terry scored the lone shootout goal, Tyler Parsons stopped all five shots he faced in the tiebreaker, and the United States outlasted Canada, 5-4, on Thursday night to win the world junior hockey title.
The game was decided in the five-round shootout after a scoreless 20-minute overtime period.
