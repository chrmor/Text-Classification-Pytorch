Tuvalu withdraws recognition of breakaway Georgia regions
The Polynesian island-state of Tuvalu has turned back on its decision to recognize Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2011 after the Foreign Ministers of Tuvalu and Georgia signed an agreement on March 31 to establish diplomatic relations.
Tuvaluan Foreign Minister Taukelina said his country would support Georgia's territorial integrity in a meeting with Georgian counterpart Maia Panjikidze on Monday. Tuvalu now joins the South Pacific island-state of Vanuatu in its pull-out of support for Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The two regions broke off from Georgia after a short war with Russia in 2008. They were immediately recognized by Russia and a few other countries, but failed to achieve widespread recognition.
Alongside Russia, the two breakaway states are also recognized by Nicaragua, Venezuela, and the Pacific island of Nauru.
