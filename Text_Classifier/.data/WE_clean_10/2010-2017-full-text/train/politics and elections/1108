Three days of mourning have been declared in Argentina after former president Nestor Kirchner died of a heart attack.
Mr Kirchner, 60, was credited with returning Argentina to financial health after a severe financial crisis in 2001-2002.
He stepped aside in favour of his wife, Cristina Kirchner, before the 2007 election, from which she emerged victorious.
Afterwards Mr Kirchner became a powerful force as head of the Peronist Party, which has controlled Argentine politics for the past 20 years.
Mr Kirchner had suffered cardiac problems in the past but doctors gave him a clean bill of health just three months ago.
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has paid tribute to Mr Kirchner, saying he was someone who fought for international justice.
"We have already announced three days of national mourning. I think the bells should chime in Venezuela - in all of Latin America, and in all the places where they struggle for a world of equals, for a world of peace. A great man has died; a patriot has died... a great patriot," he said.
All soccer matches in Argentina have been suspended until next week.
