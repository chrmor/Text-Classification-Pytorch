Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for Karachi attack
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, saying they attacked an anti-terrorism police headquarters in revenge for offensives against militants in the north-west of the country Eyewitnesses said the Crime Investigation Department (CID) building was demolished by a blast that left a 10ft wide crater.
The attackers struck in the heavily protected heart of Karachi, close to five-star hotels frequented by Westerners, the US consulate and government offices.
The police compound is used regularly to hold Taliban suspects detained in the city.
Police said five gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and hand grenades to penetrate a security corden.
"There was an exchange of fire between police and militants. Then it was followed by a truck loaded with explosives," said Salahuddin Babar Khattak, police chief of Sindh province.
"We don't know how many people were there, but the exchange of fire lasted for some time." Karachi, a sprawling port city of 18m people, had so far been spared the worst of this year's terror attacks.
Members of the Quetta Shura, comprising the leadership of the Afghan Taliban, are believed to regularly travel in and out of the city, a crucial hub for fund-raising and money laundering.
Karachi has huge strategic importance, representing the heart of Pakistan's fragile economy and a key link in the supply chain serving Nato-led forces in Afghanistan.
"We will continue such attacks as long as military operations continue against us," he said.
