File-sharing site The Pirate Bay back online with reports of 'staff' rifts
A collective sigh of relief could be heard among pirates across the seas as the world's most notorious file-sharing site, The Pirate Bay, began functioning again on Saturday after nearly two months of down-time.
Swedish authorities shut down the site, which allows users to search for torrent files to access content such as movies and music through peer-to-peer platform BitTorrent, on December 9 during a raid on its servers on the outskirts of Stockholm.
After the longest absence in its 11-year history, thepiratebay.se is now operational and displaying the image of a phoenix, just as it had after a three-day outage following a previous raid back in 2006.
Fresh torrents, including those that point to newly released content, were actively being uploaded to the site at the time of writing.
