Sylvester Turner wins Houston mayoral runoff election
The now-former state representative won the Houston mayoral runoff race over former Kemah mayor Bill King 51 percent to 49 percent.
Turner beat King by slightly more than 4,000 votes overall.
"I will do my very, very best to represent every single Houstonian in this city whether you voted for me or not," Turner said. "Tonight we'll enjoy this moment ... and tomorrow when we wake up, we'll start looking at the direction of the city of Houston."
In his concession speech, King congratulated Turner and encouraged his constituents to support the mayor-elect.
"I offered him my assistance in the very difficult challenges our city is facing, and I would encourage all Houstonians to do the same, because we are facing some very trying times over the next couple of years in our city government and he's going to need our support in making sure we get the city back on the right track," King said.
"There is no question he cares a great deal about this city," Turner said of King.
