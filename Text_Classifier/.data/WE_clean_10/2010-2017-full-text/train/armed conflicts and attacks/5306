Israel forces 'kill two militants in central Gaza'
Israeli forces have killed two Palestinians and wounded another in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics and Israeli sources say.
The incident took place near the border fence with Israel after a two-month lull in violence along the border.
Israeli military sources said the army had targeted militants who were trying to fire rockets into Israel.
They seem to be the first deaths since an unofficial April ceasefire between Israel and most Gaza militant groups.
"Two people were killed and one was injured in an artillery shelling east of the al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip," emergency services spokesman Adham Abu Selmiya told the AFP news agency.
Those who were killed are believed to be from a small militant groups sometimes called Salafist jihadis, says the BBC's Jon Donnison in Gaza.
Salafists did not sign up to the ceasefire but since then, Hamas - which governs in Gaza - has reined in smaller militant groups, our correspondent adds.
