Lost in London review: Woody Harrelson breaks boundaries with supercharged Allen-esque live film
Lost in London is a one-off live feature film, broadcast to cinemas internationally just as it was being shot on the streets of our capital, and not only that, but a film consisting of a single uninterrupted take.
The brainchild of writer-director-star Woody Harrelson, it was an experimental tightrope-walk, supercharged throughout with the possibility of failure. Of course, any live performance, in any medium, risks the same thing, with fluffed lines, dropped props, or a lighting malfunction. But the danger of a deal-breaking logistical disaster felt all the more intense with audiences glued to this around the world.
It went alright on the night, with no hideous glitches, for Harrelson’s 100-minute recreation of a shambolic episode he personally endured in 2002, while starring in the West End play On an Average Day. (“Too much of this is true”, a caption ruefully clarified at the start.) Opening in decidedly Birdman-esque fashion with an apathetic curtain call, and ending on Waterloo Bridge an hour and a half later, with the National Theatre’s illuminated scroll visible in the background, it was a knowing dalliance between stage and film – like a promenade performance caught on the fly.
