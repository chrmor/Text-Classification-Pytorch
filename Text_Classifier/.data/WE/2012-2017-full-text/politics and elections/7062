Syria’s rebel interim prime minister Ghassan Hitto announced his resignation in Istanbul on Monday during a meeting of the Syrian main opposition .
“I announce I will not continue in my capacity as prime minister tasked with leading the interim government, though I emphasise I will continue working for the interests of the revolution and towards achieving its objectives,” Hitto said in an online statement.
According to his biography, Damascus, Syria-born Hitto received B.S. degrees in computer science and mathematics from Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis in 1989; he received an MBA from Indiana Wesleyan University in 1994.
Hitto who was backed by Qatar was elected as the interim prime minister last March but failed to form a government .
