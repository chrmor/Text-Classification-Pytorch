Rain caused by Japan's Neoguri creates fatal landside
Heavy rain in Japan brought by Typhoon Neoguri has caused three fatalities, extensive damage and forced thousands to leave their homes.
A 12-year-old boy was killed in the central farming town of Nagiso after rocks and boulders swept away his home.
Neoguri, which first threatened Japan as a super typhoon, had weakened to a tropical storm by the time it came ashore but was still gusting at up to 126 kph (78 mph).
Heavy rains prompted cancellations of hundreds of flights and trains in the country and more wet weather is expected.
