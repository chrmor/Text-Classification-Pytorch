Minister: Democracy icon Suu Kyi may be released
Indonesia's Foreign Minister says Myanmar's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi may be released from house arrest following national elections next month. Marty Natalegawa said Thursday when he pressed his Myanmar counterpart Nyan Win about whether the Nobel laureate would be freed in November, Nyan Win did not dispute that Suu Kyi's detention period was due to expire Nov. 13. Natalegawa said: "Our understanding is that the term of her sentence will be expiring in November. And that understanding was not disputed." Democracy leader Suu Kyi has been imprisoned or under house arrest for 15 of the past 21 years. Southeast Asian leaders have repeatedly pushed Myanmar's government for her release. However, it has resisted those calls.
