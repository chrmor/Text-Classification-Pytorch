Nearly 200 killed as ferry capsizes in Tanzania
The ferry, MV Spice Islanders, was heavily overloaded. Police in Zanzibar said they had recovered 192 bodies, and found 606 survivors.
Survivor Abdullah Saied said and some potential passengers had refused to board when it was leaving the mainland port of Dar es Salaam.
It sank in an area with heavy currents, in deep sea between mainland Tanzania and Pemba Island at about 1am on Saturday. Boats frequently traverse the route, but travel times vary depending on the vessel.
"I realised something strange on the movement of the ship. It was like zigzag or dizziness," said 15-year-old Yahya Hussein, who survived by clinging to a plank of wood with three others.
"After I noticed that I jumped to the rear side of ship and few minutes later the ship went lopsided."
Miss Hussein said there had been many children aboard the ship.
After the ship began to list, water rushed through the main cabin and stopped the engines, said Mwita Massoud, another survivor.
About 260 people had been rescued, with 107 people confirmed drowned. Mohammed Aboud Mohammed, the minister for state in the vice president's office, said that 45 bodies had been recovered.
"We appeal for calm to the public. The government is doing its best it can to handle the situation. There is no need to panic," said Mr Mohammed.
In the hours after the sinking, the government strongly discouraged journalists from reporting the event and tried to restrict information about the accident.
The green and hilly island of Pemba is often described as one of the best scuba diving destinations in the world. Tanzania is heavily reliant on tourism to support its economy.
Thousands of residents mobbed the docks of Stone Town on Zanzibar, an island near Pemba, waiting for news. One man was screaming that he had lost 25 members of his family, including his sisters, his wife and grandsons. Many of the crowd were crying or screaming. All the shops were closed.
Seven bodies have washed up so far, said witness Abdirizak Juma.
Many of those present expressed anger that the ship had been allowed to leave port so overloaded and called on government officials to resign.
They said the island should have divers and rescue boats, but it only has a small vessel to try to stop smuggling.
In 2006, another ship capsized at the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, claiming hundreds of lives.
