In golf, Henrik Stenson wins the 2016 Open Championship defeating Phil Mickelson after a closely fought battle in the final round at the Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland. Stenson's total of 264, 20 under par, is the lowest stroke total ever recorded in any major championship and ties Jason Day's performance at last year's PGA Championship for the lowest score in relation to par at a major. It is also Stenson's first victory in a major tournament. (The Guardian)
