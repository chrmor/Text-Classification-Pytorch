Suicide Attack Kills Six Near Iraq's Shi'ite City Of Karbala
A suicide attack in central Iraq has killed at least six people, officials say.
The Interior Ministry said the bomber blew himself up in the town of Ain al-Tamr on November 14 after security forces killed five of his accomplices and surrounded him in a house.
Six other people were wounded in the blast.
Ain al-Tamer is located 50 kilometers west of the Shi'ite shrine city of Karbala.
The Islamic State (IS) group said in a statement that it had planned to target Shi'a, police, and army personnel as Iraq's Shi'ite majority were preparing to mark the end of a 40-day mourning period for the 7th century death of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Mohammad's grandson.
IS militants also targeted Ain al-Tamer in late August, killing 18 people.
