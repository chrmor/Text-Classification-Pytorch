D.C. Drive-By Mass Shooting Caught On Video: 11 People Shot, 1 Seriously Wounded
A drive-by shooting committed early Monday morning that injured 11 people in Washington, D.C., was captured on surveillance video and the Metropolitan Police Department is urging D.C. residents with knowledge about the vehicles involved to come forward.
The video, which you can view below, was posted by the department’s OfficialDCPolice YouTube account and has been viewed more than 300 times. It shows the occupants of one dark car firing shots at a group of people congregating on the sidewalk as pedestrians duck for cover in Northwest D.C. A second car trails closely behind.
Police said they believe the dark car is a BMW and the other vehicle is a grayish or silver sedan.
D.C. police are labeling the cars “vehicles of interest,” with the occupants being accused of “assault with intent to kill.” The incident occurred around 2:10 a.m. Monday on the 1200 block of North Capitol Street.
Eleven people were shot in the drive-by and one was considered to be seriously injured in the shooting, the Washington Post reported.
The victims were hit in the arms and legs, D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier told the paper.
A D.C. resident who lives near where the shooting occurred said it didn’t faze him and that he slept through the incident.
“It’s not as bad as it seems on TV,” the 30-year-old man told the Post. “The liquor store brings a lot of drunk people to the corner, but that’s about it.”
The department is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone with information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator or perpetrators responsible for the shooting.
Those who know anything about the incident can call police at 202-727-9099 or text tips to 50411. Tipsters can remain anonymous.
