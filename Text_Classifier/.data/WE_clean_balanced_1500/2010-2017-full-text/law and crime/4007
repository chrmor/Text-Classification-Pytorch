UN condemns Faisal killing
Strong condemnations have been poured in following the murder of Jagriti publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan. The United Nations condemned the attacks on bloggers and publishers in Bangladesh that claimed the life of Faisal on Saturday. Criticising the killing, the United Nations expressed deep concerns over threats to free speech in a press release on Saturday night. This murder and the violent assaults on Ahmedur Rashid Tutul, Tareq Rahim, and Ranadipan Basu are unacceptable. The attacks were aimed to intimidate and restrict the right of individuals to express themselves freely, the statement reads. The UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, Robert D Watkins, said “These killings must be condemned at all levels of political and religious leadership in order to prevent further attacks." “The perpetrators must also be brought to justice and the authorities need to provide immediate protection to citizens thought to be at risk,” he added.
