MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec), which acted as the National Board of Canvassers, proclaimed Thursday the 12 winning senatorial candidates, including boxing icon Manny Pacquiao.
Accompanied by the members of their families, the incoming 12 senators who got the highest number of votes from the May 9 elections include reelectionist Senate President Franklin Drilon, former director general of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority Joel Villanueva, reelectionist Senator Vicente Sotto III, and former senators Panfilo Lacson, Richard Gordon, and Juan Miguel Zubiri.
Also proclaimed were Pacquiao, who is the outgoing congressman of southern province of Sarangani, Risa Hontiveros, former senator Francis Pangilinan, outgoing Valenzuela Representative Sherwin Gatchalian, reelectionist Senator Ralph and former Justice Secretary Leila de Lima.
While there were still remaining votes that need to be canvassed, Comelec Chairman Andres Bautista said those votes would not have any "material effect" to De Lima, who ranked 12th and received a difference of about 1.3 million votes from the top 13 senatorial bet.
Section 4, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution provides that the term of office of the senators shall be six years and shall commence at noon of June 30.
The 24-member Senate uses staggered election, with only one-half of its members up for election at any given time.
The 2016 election of members to the Senate of the Philippines was the 32nd election of members to the Senate of the Philippines. The seats of 12 senators elected in 2010 are to be filled during this election. The winners in this election will join the winners of the 2013 election to form the 17th Congress of the Philippines. The senators elected in 2013 will serve until June 30, 2019, while the senators elected in this election will serve up to June 30, 2022.
