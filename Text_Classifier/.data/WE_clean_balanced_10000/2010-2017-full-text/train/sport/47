Guatemala football club Xinabajul executive shot dead
The vice-president of a Guatemalan football club has been shot dead, after receiving death threats over the team's poor performance.
Police said Carlos Noe Gomez of Deportivo Xinabajul was killed by two men who were waiting for him as he left a team meeting.
Xinabajul, based in the northern town of Huehuetenango, are at the bottom of Guatemala's national league.
Police are focusing on threats Gomez said he received several weeks ago.
National police spokesman Donald Gonzalez said Gomez was attacked late Friday. Guatemala's national league condemned the killing and called for a "serious and profound" investigation.
The killing follows that of Carlos Mercedes Vasquez, from the first-division club Malacateco.
He was found murdered in November last year after being kidnapped.
The football star's dismembered body was found dumped in five plastic bags with a note accusing him of "messing with the women of others".
A suspect in the murder, Elmer Aroldo Zelada Galdamez, was arrested but freed in December by a group of armed men who stormed the prison in Malaceteco where he was being held.
