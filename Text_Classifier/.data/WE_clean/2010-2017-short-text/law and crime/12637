A prison officer is killed in an ambush by dissident Irish republicans as he drives to work along Northern Ireland's M1 motorway. The officer, who worked at the province's Maghaberry Prison, is the first member of the Northern Ireland Prison Service to be killed in such an attack in 20 years.

Their exact locations are unknown, even to their lawyers and family members. They had petitioned to be held in Moscow which would have allowed them to watch their young children grow. (The Guardian)
