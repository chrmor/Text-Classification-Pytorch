Iran will not negotiate with US over missile program, says foreign minister
John Kerry says US is prepared to address Iran’s concerns if it halts missile launches, as Iran official suggests US allies are providing arms to Isis
Iran’s foreign minister said on Sunday the country’s missile program was not up for negotiation with the US.
The missile program and “defense capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran are not negotiable”, said Mohammad Javad Zarif after meeting his Estonian counterpart, Marina Kaljurand.
He added that if Washington was serious about defensive issues in the Middle East, it should stop supplying arms to Saudi Arabia and Israel.
A Saudi-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes and battling the Iran-backed Shia rebels in Yemen since March 2015. Iran also supports anti-Israeli militant groups.
US secretary of state John Kerry said on Thursday the US and its partners were telling Iran that they were “prepared to work on a new arrangement to find a peaceful solution to these issues”.
He said Iran first had to make it clear to all involved that it was prepared to cease provocative ballistic missile launches and tests.
Zarif on Sunday also hinted that regional US allies were among those quietly supporting the extremist Islamic State group.
“The US needs to view regional issues more seriously than raise baseless and threadbare allegations against Iran,” said Zarif. “Mr Kerry should ask US allies where the Islamic State’s arms come from.”
