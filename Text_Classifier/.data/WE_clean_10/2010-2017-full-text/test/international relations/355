The World On Arirang
North Korea reportedly held a meeting earlier this month aimed at hampering the upcoming Seoul G20 summit slated to be held in November. This is according to Radio Free Asia which cited a source that is currently in Pyeongyang to participate in the upcoming Workers' Party Convention. The source said an emergency meeting led by North Korean heir apparent Kim Jong-un was held in early September where the communist state defined the G20 summit as a political scheme among world powers with the goal of further isolating the North from the international community. At the meeting the report said the North discussed ways to continue fueling a sense of insecurity in the region and promoting anti-G20 protests held by pro-North Korean groups.
