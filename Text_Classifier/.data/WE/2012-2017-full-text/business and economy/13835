Government sells 5.4% stake in RBS for £2.1bn
The Government has raised £2.1bn by selling some of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, but has made a loss of around £1bn compared to the price it bought the shares for at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.
UK Financial Investments, the body that holds the Government's RBS stake, sold 630 million shares - a 5.4% stake in the bank, at 330p each. That compares to the 502p price per share paid by the Government when it bailed out the bank.
