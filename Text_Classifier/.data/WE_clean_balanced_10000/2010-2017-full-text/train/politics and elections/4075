Brazil's Jose Alencar 'stable' after heart attack
Brazil's vice-president has been moved out of intensive care, after suffering a heart attack on Thursday.
Jose Alencar is now said to be in a stable condition and has been moved to a specialist ward at the Sirio Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo.
Mr Alencar is currently acting president while outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in South Korea attending the G20 summit.
The politician, who is in his late 70s, has fought abdominal cancer since 1997.
Mr Alencar "underwent catheterisation showing there were no major obstructions to his arteries", hospital doctors told AFP news agency.
He is now "stable from a cardiac point of view", they added.
Mr Alencar is due to leave office along with Lula in January, when Brazil's newly elected president, Dilma Rousseff, will be sworn in.
