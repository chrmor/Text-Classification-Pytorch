Iconic Birdsville Races washed out
The iconic Birdsville races have been postponed for the first time in their 128-year history after unseasonal weather flooded the track.
According to weatherzone.com.au, more than 33mm of rain dumped on the Birdsville track, about 10km north of the South Australian border, early on Saturday morning.
Police say the heavy rain has led to the closure of roads around the remote town, meaning 3,000 people may be temporarily stranded there.
Organisers decided not to go ahead with the seven-race meeting on Saturday because of the heavy track, with reports indicating parts of it remains under water.
Club president David Brook couldn't be contacted directly by AAP on Saturday but wrote on social networking site Twitter that the race had been rescheduled for Tuesday.
"Horse racing postponed today but now planning for first ever Tuesday running of the Birdsville Cup," the Twitter account said.
