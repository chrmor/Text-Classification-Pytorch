A major earthquake has rattled parts of New Zealand, including the capital Wellington.
New Zealand geologists say the tremor had a magnitude of 7, but the US Geological Survey is putting it at 6.2.
The long, rolling tremor was felt from the Bay of Plenty in the North Island to Dunedin in the South Island.
The quake hit at a depth of 236 kilometres, around 173 kilometres north-west of Wellington, the USGS said.
No tsunami warnings have been issued.
Steve Sherburn from New Zealand's Geological and Nuclear Sciences says there are no reports of major damage or injuries yet.
"A shallow earthquake this size underneath the city would have been producing Christchurch-like effects so potentially in the southern and western-North Islands there may be some slight damage," he said.
A 6.3-magnitude quake hit New Zealand's second largest city of Christchurch in February last year, flattening office blocks and toppling buildings onto lunchtime crowds and leaving 185 people dead.
The country sits on the so-called Ring of Fire, the boundary of the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates, and experiences up to 15,000 tremors a year.
