Ukraine crisis: NATO suspends cooperation with Moscow
These would include possible deployments and reinforcements of alliance military assets in Eastern European member states, a possible review of training and exercise plans in the near term, a possible increase of the readiness level of the NATO Response Force, and a possible review and update of NATO defense and military plans, the official said.
"Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that Russia is withdrawing its troops," Rasmussen said at the opening of the two-day meeting. "This is not what we're seeing. And this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation."
Discussion of the issue while Yanukovych was in power "led to freezing of Russian-Ukrainian political communications, to headaches in the relationship between NATO and Russia and, what is the most dangerous, to the deepening of the split of Ukrainian society, the majority of which doesn't support the idea of Ukraine entering NATO," a Foreign Ministry statement said.
