Al Shabaab commander killed in US airstrike in Somalia
The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it conducted an airstrike, killing a senior Al Shabaab leader in Somalia on May 27.
Abdullahi Haji Da'ud served as a principal coordinator of Al Shabaab's militia attacks in Somalia, Kenya, and Uganda and also held several top positions within the terrorist organization.
“We are confident that the removal from the terrorist network of this experienced Al Shabaab commander with extensive operational experience will disrupt near-term attack planning, potentially saving many innocent lives,” the Pentagon said in a statement.
The Pentagon is assessing the overall results of the strike, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said.
The Al Shabaab terror organization is responsible for several deadly attacks, including an attack on a college in Kenya last April that killed 147 mostly Christian students, and a September 2013 attack on Westgate Mall in Nairobi that killed 67.
