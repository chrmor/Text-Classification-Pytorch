At least 26 killed in Syrian government strikes on IS-held Palmyra - monitor
BEIRUT (Reuters) - At least 26 people were killed by Syrian government air strikes on the Islamic State-held city of Palmyra in central Syria on Friday, a group monitoring the war said.
The death toll included 12 members of the jihadist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, after reporting earlier that government forces had launched at least 25 air strikes on the city.
Palmyra, home to vast Roman-era ruins, was seized by Islamic State insurgents from government forces in May.
