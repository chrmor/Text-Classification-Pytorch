Iran detains 'spies' as it moves to ease fears over Stuxnet cyber attack
Iran had detained several "spies" involved in attempts to sabotage the country's nuclear programme through cyberspace, the Iranian intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, said.
The announcement yesterday follows the attack on industrial computer systems in Iran by the Stuxnet worm, designed to disrupt its nuclear facilities, including the Bushehr power plant.
Although officials attempted to play down the significance of the Stuxnet attack, which had infected more than 30,000 computers, Moslehi's comments, apparently meant to reassure Iranians, suggest the cyber attack had caused more alarm in the regime than has so far been acknowledged.
Suspicions have also been growing in recent days that the Stuxnet worm may have been designed as much to spy on the systems as to destroy them.
In remarks carried on Iranian state television and the Mehr news service, Moslehi said Iran had discovered the "destructive activities of the arrogant [western powers] in cyberspace", adding that "different ways to confront them have been designed and implemented".
He added: "I assure all citizens that the intelligence apparatus currently has complete supervision of cyberspace and will not allow any leak or destruction of our country's nuclear activities."
Moslehi gave no details of when the arrests had taken place or whether those detained were Iranians or citizens of another country.
