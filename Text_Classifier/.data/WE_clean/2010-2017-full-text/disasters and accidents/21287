Nepal Hit by 7.3-Magnitude Earthquake; Dozens Confirmed Dead
A 7.3-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on Tuesday, killing dozens of people and triggering renewed panic on the devastated streets of Kathmandu.
The temblor came less than three weeks after 8,000 people died when a 7.8-magnitude quake rocked the Himalayan country on April 25.
“It was completely unexpected," 21-year-old nursing student Shristi Mainali told NBC News from Kathmandu. "At first we just felt like a shake, and we thought it was normal, we are having aftershock, but it didn’t stop, so we got up and rushed to our garden. We could see the ground moving, shaking … in that moment you cannot differentiate whether it’s the ground is shaking or it’s your legs shaking."

David Chen, a 32-year-old who is from San Francisco, was at the ancient Changu Narayan outside Kathmandu when the quake hit.
“There had been aftershocks but they had all been very quick, just a few seconds. But this one, it just seemed liked it would never stop,” said Chen, who was in Nepal helping map UNESCO world heritage sites as the director of engineering for San Francisco-based firm Skycatch. “It was really scary.”
