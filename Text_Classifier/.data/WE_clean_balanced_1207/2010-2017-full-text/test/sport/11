Sachin Tendulkar becomes the first player to reach 15,000 Test runs
Tendulkar scores record milestone against West Indies Veteran retains chance for 100th century on 33 not out
Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to reach 15,000 Test runs as India edged closer to victory in the first Test against the West Indies in Delhi.
The 38-year-old reached the milestone towards the end of the third day's play and he also still has an outside chance of claiming an unprecedented 100th international century after finishing on 33 not out.
Rahul Dravid was also still there on 30no as India closed on 152 for two, needing another 124 to win with two days remaining.
The veteran duo guided their side towards this victory target with an unbroken 57-run stand, while Tendulkar reached the milestone with a single to extra cover off Devendra Bishoo, earning him the congratulations of both Dravid and opponents alike.
Dravid, who himself is approaching 13,000 Test runs, had a run-out scare just before the close but he survived and India will now fancy their chances of going on to claim victory tomorrow.
