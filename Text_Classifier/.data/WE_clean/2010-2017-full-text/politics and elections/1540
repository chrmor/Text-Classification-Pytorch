Villawood protesters want talks with immigration officials
Eleven asylum seekers who are protesting on the roof of Sydney's Villawood Detention Centre say they want someone from the Immigration Department to visit them.
Nine Sri Lankan Tamil men and two Iraqi men are standing and lying on the tiled roof at the centre.
For the second time today, one of the group has cut himself.
They have been here since yesterday just a few hours after a Fijian man is thought to have killed himself by jumping off the roof.
Josef Rauluni, 36, had been told he would be deported.
Bala Vigneswaran from the Australian Tamil Congress says the men on the roof would rather die than go back to their homeland where they could be tortured.
"That option is not on," he said.
"If they are going to die there, [they say] we'll die here cause we'll die without torture."
Mr Vigneswaran called one of the men on the roof and translated his comments to journalists.
The asylum seeker said they want someone from the Immigration Department to visit them, to hear their stories and how desperate they are.
They say nobody from the department has been to visit them so far.
Mr Rauluni's death has sparked calls from the Federal Government's Immigration Detention Advisory Group for an overhaul of mental health care for asylum seekers.
But the new Federal Minister for Mental Health, Mark Butler, says it is not his responsibility.
"Those are primarily matters that should be directed at the Immigration Minister," he said.
"I know also that there has been close interaction between the Immigration Minister and the Health Minister in the past and I expect that the Immigration Minister and the department will continue to take some advice from the Health portfolio about these issues."
The Immigration Minister Chris Bowen says he is reviewing what he describes as a tragic incident.
"Obviously in relation to security I'll have a look at this incident and see if there's anything to learn from this incident," he said.
