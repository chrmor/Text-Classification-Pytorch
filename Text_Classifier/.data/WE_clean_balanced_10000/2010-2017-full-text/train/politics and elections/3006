Iran parliament: Ahmadinejad ministry move illegal
TEHRAN, June 1 (Reuters) - Iran’s parliament said on Wednesday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acted illegally by declaring himself caretaker oil minister and referred the case to the judiciary, increasing pressure on him to quit the post.
The legislature, which has repeatedly clashed with Ahmadinejad over key policy issues, voted to approve a report by its energy committee which found Ahmadinejad’s move an “obvious violation of law”, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
Last month Ahmadinejad sacked Oil Minister Massoud Mirkazemi as part of a plan to merge several ministries to cut their number to 17 from 21, alarming his rivals within the conservative ruling elite. [ID:nHAF431903] (Writing by Robin Pomeroy; Editing by Jon Boyle)
