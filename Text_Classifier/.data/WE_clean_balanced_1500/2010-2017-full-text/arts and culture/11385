Bruce Springsteen sideman blasts London jobsworths as The Boss & Paul McCartney are cut off in their prime
IT was the jam session Bruce Springsteen had waited decades for – playing alongside former Beatle Paul McCartney.
But concert organisers at London’s Hard Rock Calling couldn’t even wait a few minutes to allow the 78,000-strong crowd to enjoy the rock legends’ duet.
As they prepared to launch into a final song, they cut off the sound from the stage in Hyde Park – meaning the pair couldn’t even say thanks to the audience.
He wrote: “One of the great gigs ever in my opinion. But, seriously, when did England become a police state?
“Is there just too much fun in the world? We would have been off by 11 if we’d done one more. Who were we disturbing?”
Macca, 70, was the last of several star guests to join Springsteen and his E Street Band in a three-hour performance.  Springsteen, 62, welcomed him on stage and said he had “waited 50 years” to perform with him.
They sang I Saw Her Standing There and Twist and Shout before the microphones were cut off.
Even London mayor Boris Johnson slammed the decision to silence the stars on Saturday. He said: “If they had called me, my answer would have been for them to jam in the name of the Lord!”
Fans vented their fury on online forums, branding it “rock and roll sacrilege”. And actor Simon Pegg tweeted: “What joyless, bitter killjoy made that decision?”
Comedian Stephen Merchant also took to Twitter to say: “Ashamed to be British right now.”
Organisers Live Nation said: “The curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public’s health and safety.”
Other acts at Hard Rock Calling on Saturday included Scots singer Amy Macdonald.
