India building collapse in Pune city kills six workers
At least six people have been killed after a building collapsed in Pune city in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, police say.
Rescue operations are going on as authorities fear that 20 people may still be trapped under the debris.
The four-storey building was under construction and the dead and trapped are all workers on the site.
Poor construction material and practices are often blamed for many of the building collapses in India.
Eye-witnesses said more bodies were recovered from the site and have been taken to a government hospital nearby.
