Italian MP complains on Turkish Embassy’s anti-Armenian activity
YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 15, ARMENPRESS. Italian MP Romina Mura voiced a question before the country’s Government regarding the activity of the Turkish Embassy to Italy. “Armenpress” reports about this citing the personal website of the Italian MP.
Among other things, Mura underscored: “The 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Empire will be marked next year. 1.5 million people were killed. So many years have passed now, but Turkey still continues denying that it has committed genocide and conducts the policy of putting pressure on all those, who call the elimination of the Armenian Christians a genocide. Turkey has reached a point, that it now targets Pope Francis, who called it 'the first genocide of the 20th century'.”
The fact of the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman government has been documented, recognized, and affirmed in the form of media and eyewitness reports, laws, resolutions, and statements by many states and international organizations. The complete catalogue of all documents categorizing the 1915 wholesale massacre of the Armenian population in Ottoman Empire as a premeditated and thoroughly executed act of genocide, is extensive. Uruguay was the first country to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide in 1965. The massacres of the Armenian people were officially condemned and recognized as genocide in accordance with the international law by France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Greece, Slovakia, Cyprus, Lebanon, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Canada, Vatican and Australia.
