Iceland's Radical Pirate Party Falls Short in Parliamentary Election
Icelanders opted for continuity over radical change in the country's parliamentary election this weekend, with the anti-establishment Pirate Party winning less support than predicted.
Formed just four years ago, the party had polled between 18 and 30 percent in the six months leading up to the contest.
The country's electoral system means it is near-impossible for any one party to win a majority. But these figures would have put the Pirate Party in a prime position to form a coalition with the country's left-wing and environmentalist green parties.
Instead, the Pirates won around 14.5 percent of the vote, according to the results announced Sunday.
While this took their number of lawmakers from three to ten, it meant that the predicted left-wing alliance doesn't have enough members of parliament to form a majority government.
The Pirates had pledged to legalize drugs, decide policy using online referendum and grant citizenship to Edward Snowden.
Their support largely stemmed from a country whose successive governments had overseen the economic banking crisis of 2008 and become embroiled in the Panama Papers scandal in April.
