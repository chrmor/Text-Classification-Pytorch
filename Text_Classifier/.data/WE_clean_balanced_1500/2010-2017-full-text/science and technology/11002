New York Today: Mercury on the Move
Greetings, earthlings, on this blustery Monday.
Look up, New York: Mercury is traversing the sun this morning.
Astronomers refer to this as the Mercury transit, and it will continue until 2:42 p.m.
The last time Mercury zipped across the sun was in 2006, and it won’t happen again until 2019, said Jason Kendall, a professor of astronomy and physics at William Paterson University who is a board member at the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York.
“These are very rare events, and it’s even more rare that we get to watch the whole thing,” he said.
It’s the innermost planet in our solar system — that is, the closest to the sun — and has no atmosphere. Its temperature can swing from 800 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 200 at night, Professor Kendall said.
