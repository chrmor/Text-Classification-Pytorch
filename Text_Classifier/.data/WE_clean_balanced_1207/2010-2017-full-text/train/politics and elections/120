Aus Labor Party scrambles to recover
Former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has ruled out the possibility of ever challenging Julia Gillard for the Labor Party leadership again.
His office has issued a statement saying Mr Rudd wants to make "100 percent clear" there are now "no circumstances" under which he would return.
However, he has confirmed he will contest the next election as a local member of parliament.
Australia's ruling Labor Party continues to flounder, with several Cabinet members loyal to Kevin Rudd either being sacked or resigning.
Prime Minister and party leader Julia Gillard last night claimed Labor's leadership issue had been put to rest â€“ but she found herself having to assert her position again this morning as internal ructions continued.
No one contested Ms Gillard in yesterday's leadership spill, which she says was unexpected.
''I was a bit surprised given all of the build-up that Kevin [Rudd] didn't stand, but having chosen not to stand that does underline that this is all definitely over,'' she told Today FM radio.
Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Wayne Swan, a supporter of Ms Gillard's, vowed the government would get on with its work.
But Labor now has to hurriedly reshuffle its Cabinet, with several of Mr Rudd's supporters being shown the door.
Chris Bowen resigned as a minister this morning and senior minister Simon Crean, whose posturing prompted the leadership spill, was sacked yesterday.
Parliamentary secretary Richard Marles, deputy whips Ed Husic and Janelle Saffin, and Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon will also go.
Mr Crean had been relying on Mr Rudd to challenge Ms Gillard.
''He should have run. There's no question about that,'' he said. ''There's no way that he can countenance or credibly argue that his position should be taken seriously.''
The drama has bolstered the opposition, with Leader Tony Abbott saying the "civil war" has paralysed the government.
