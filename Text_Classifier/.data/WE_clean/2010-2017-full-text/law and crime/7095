Russia says Belgium contributed to Politkovskaya's suspected killer arrest
Belgium's law enforcers contributed to the arrest of the suspected killer of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Russian Investigative Committee said on Tuesday.
Belgium's law enforcers contributed to the arrest of the suspected killer of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Russian Investigative Committee said on Tuesday.
Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said the suspect, Rustam Makhmudov, had been detained in Russia's North Caucasus republic of Chechnya and would soon be brought to Moscow.
"Law enforcement agencies of Belgium, where the accused had been hiding out earlier, also contributed to Makhmudov's detention," Markin said. "Makhmudov was forced to leave Belgium after the country's law enforcers stepped up the search for him."
Politkovskaya, a fierce Kremlin critic, was shot dead in her apartment block more than four years ago.
Her murder, like many other killings of reporters and attacks on journalists in Russia in recent years, remains unsolved as the masterminds of the crime have not been found.
