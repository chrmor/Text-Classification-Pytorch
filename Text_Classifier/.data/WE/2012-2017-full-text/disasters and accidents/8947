Bone-Chilling Winter Blast Wipes Out Power in South
Emergency crews deployed for battle Wednesday with a vicious ice storm that cut off power for hundreds of thousands of people across the Southeast â€” and worse power failures were on the way.
About 400,000 customers were without power Wednesday evening in Georgia and the Carolinas, utilities reported. That was on top of tens of thousands more who were in the dark as the storm gathered strength earlier in the week across Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama.
"This storm is very unpredictable. It's one of the toughest storms we're going to see in our history," North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Wednesday.
Nearly 600 power workers prepared to camp overnight at the Mall of Georgia in Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, where support staff and volunteers showed up to serve breakfast and dinner and to pack box lunches, NBC station WXIA reported.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed warned that "the hardest part of this storm is tonight and tomorrow," as residents get cabin fever and want to go outside.
"Let me be very clear: Last night and today was the opening act of what's getting ready to occur," Reed said, as snow continues to fall and temperatures plunge back below freezing, re-icing everything.
