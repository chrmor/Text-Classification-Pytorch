Moscow, May 29: A Russian government plane left Syria Tuesday with some 130 people from Russia and other former Soviet republics who decided to leave the country amid the ongoing conflict, said a spokesperson for Russia's Emergencies Ministry.
An Ilyushin Il-62 departed from Latakia, a major port city in Syria's northwest, with 128 people aboard, spokeswoman Irina Rossius said.
Two Russian planes had arrived earlier that day bringing more than 20 metric tonnes of humanitarian aid.
Over 380 citizens of Russia and other former Soviet republics have fled civil war in Syria on Emergencies Ministry planes since January.
