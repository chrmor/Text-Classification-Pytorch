PM calls for overhaul of disaster management system
SEOUL, July 29 (Yonhap) -- The nation should revise the current disaster response system to cope with unusual weather conditions, the prime minister said on Friday after deadly floods and landslides from torrential rains claimed many lives in the country's central region earlier this week. The record-breaking rainfall has pounded Seoul and Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces since Wednesday, killing at least 59 people, flooding thousands of homes and triggering multiple landslides, according to the central disaster management headquarters.
