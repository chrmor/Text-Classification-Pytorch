Fire in Turkish dormitory kills 12, including 11 teenage girls: officials
ANKARA (Reuters) - Twelve people, including eleven teenagers, were killed when a fire swept through a girls dormitory in the southern Turkish province of Adana on Tuesday, officials said.
The fire, which broke out in a dormitory housing middle and high school students, may have been caused by an electrical fault, Omer Celik, a senior government official who represents the province in parliament, told broadcaster CNN Turk.
At least twenty-two other girls were injured, Celik said. Also among the dead was a woman who worked at the dormitory.
The dormitory housed impoverished girls whose families coming from nearby villages where there are no schools, Elif Dogan Turkmen, an opposition parliamentarian, told CNN Turk.
Television footage showed a blaze rising from the rooftop of a multi-storey building and teams of firefighters working to put it out.
