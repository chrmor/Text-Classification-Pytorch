WASHINGTON — President Obama created three new national monuments via executive order Friday, setting aside more than 1 million acres of public land in three states.
"One of the great legacies of this incredible country .... is our national parks and national monuments," Obama said during a brief Oval Office ceremony. "It is something that we pass on from generation to generation"
The new monuments feature "incredible history," Obama said, including pre-historic mammoth bones in Texas, rare rock formations in Nevada, and wilderness areas in northern California.
• Berryessa Snow Mountain in northern California, a woodlands landscape some 100 miles from the San Francisco Bay Area that supports a wide of variety of wildlife, and accommodates recreational activity that includes hiking, hunting, fishing, camping, horseback riding, mountain biking and rafting.
• Waco Mammoth in Texas, some 107 acres about halfway between Dallas and Austin that features the remains of two dozen Columbian Mammoths. The bones are more than 65,000 years old.
"These unique and well-preserved remains provide superlative opportunities for scientific study, including a rare opportunity to understand the behavior and ecology of the now extinct Columbian Mammoth," said an administration statement.
• Basin and Range in Nevada, some 700,000 acres of mountains and valleys about two hours from Las Vegas. It features "rock art" dating back 4,000 years
"The monument also allows for the continuation of certain historic uses, including livestock grazing and military use," the administration said.
Obama's issued the orders under the federal Antiques Act, a law he has now used to establish or expand 19 national monuments.
"Altogether," the administration statement said, "he has protected more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters — more than any other President."
