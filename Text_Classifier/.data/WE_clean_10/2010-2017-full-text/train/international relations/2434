The 25-nation International Steering Group, which guided Kosovo after it declared independence, formally ended the supervision of the region on Monday, local media reported.
Kosovo, a landlocked region with a population of mainly ethnic Albanians, declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008. More than 90 nations, including the United States, acknowledged Kosovo independence.
However, the UN mission and NATO-led peacekeepers will stay in Kosovo, which remains home to thousands of ethnic Serbs.
Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic reiterated on Monday that his country will never acknowledge Kosovo’s independence.
“The Kosovo problem is not solved until Serbia agrees [with its solution],” he said, adding that he expected international talks on Kosovo to continue in the near future.
Both Serbia and Russia do not recognize Kosovo's independence.
