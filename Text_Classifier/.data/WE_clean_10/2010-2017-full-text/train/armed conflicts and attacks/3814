Israeli tank fire kills teen in Gaza
Israeli forces have pounded the northern Gaza Strip town of Jabaliya, killing a teenager and wounding another two.
The attack occurred on Tuesday when Israeli tanks opened fire on eastern Jabaliya, Press TV reported. Earlier on the day, several Israeli bulldozers, backed by seven tanks, broke into the Palestinian enclave's northern town of Beit Hanun. The tanks entered around 400 meters into the Hamas-run territory, but it was not immediately clear whether they were after demolishing Palestinian houses in the area. Israel and Hamas are formally committed to a truce that ended Israel's 22 days of massive military offensive between December 2008 and January 2009 against the Gaza Strip. The all-out war left over 1,400 Palestinians dead and tens of thousands more displaced. Egypt has recently warned Hamas of Israeli plans to soon wage another huge onslaught against Gaza. In recent months, Israel has stepped up its ground and air attacks against the coastal strip, killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians. (Source: PressT
