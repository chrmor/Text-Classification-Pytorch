Galeras volcano erupts
Following a strong eruption of the southern Colombian Galeras volcano on Friday, more than a thousand people responded to authorities’ calls to evacuate the region.
The volcano, that has caused several alerts over the past year, erupted again on Friday, forcing local authoritis to declare a red alert and call on the thousands of inhabitants of the region to evacuate.
Locals are asked to put on masks to avoid inhaling ash coming from the volcano.
Geologists monitoring the volcano’s activity declared a code orange a few weeks ago and have been expecting the volcano to erupt. Until now, the majority of the locals refused to leave their homes.
