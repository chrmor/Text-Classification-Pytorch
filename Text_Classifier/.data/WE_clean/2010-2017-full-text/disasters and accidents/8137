Deadly Quake Hits in 3 Nations
A powerful earthquake killed at least 14 people in a heavily populated valley in Central Asia early Wednesday, emergency officials said. Almost all the casualties were in Uzbekistan, where officials confirmed 13 deaths. The magnitude-6.1 quake, which was centered in Kyrgyzstan, hit shortly after midnight in a mountainous area some 20 miles from the eastern Uzbek city of Ferghana. No deaths were reported in Kyrgyzstan itself. In Tajikistan, the third country that shares the Ferghana Valley, one death was reported.
