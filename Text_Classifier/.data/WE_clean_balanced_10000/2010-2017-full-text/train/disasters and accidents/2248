At least 10 worshippers were killed when the roof of a mosque collapsed in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
The incident took place in Daroghawala, a low-income neighbourhood in the outer city with narrow and congested streets.
"The bodies of at least nine worshippers have been pulled out from the rubble of the roof, while an unknown number of people are still buried," rescue official Jam Sajjad told AFP.
Authorities said the death toll is expected to rise.
There were up to 30 people at the daily afternoon prayer.
"We fear that the death toll might rise. The roads there are very crowded, preventing heavy machines from entering the area to remove the debris. The people of the area are also helping the rescue effort," Sajjad said.
Local government official Usman Ahmed confirmed the roof collapse and toll.
"It was just another normal day when I stood with others to say my prayers, but suddenly everything turned into pain, dust and it was suffocating," said worshipper Zahid Bashir.
"I am lucky to have survived this. Life and death is in the hands of Allah."
Safety standards, particularly in construction, are very lax in nuclear-armed but impoverished Pakistan.

The collapse of the Margalla Towers apartment block in Islamabad in a 2005 earthquake killed 78 people, with shoddy construction blamed.
Floods across India and Pakistan due to the monsoon rains have stranded hundreds of thousands of people and killed 400.
