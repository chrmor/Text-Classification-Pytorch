UN slaps ban on renegade Libyan oil shipment
Security council blacklists Indian-flagged cargo ship for illegally transporting crude oil from Libyan port under control of splinter group
The UN security council has blacklisted an Indian-flagged cargo ship for illegally transporting crude oil from a Libyan port not under government control.
The council’s committee monitoring sanctions against Libya put the vessel Distya Ameya on the list on Wednesday based on information it received from the Libyan government that it was carrying oil in violation of a 2014 UN resolution prohibiting shipments from rebel-held ports.
The sanctions committee said that on Tuesday the vessel was north of al-Bayda, Libya, heading for Malta.
It said the Distya Ameya may have been sold recently to an unknown buyer and the vessel’s name may have changed to Kassos.
The committee said the ship would remain subject to UN sanctions, including an asset freeze, until 26 July unless it terminated the measures earlier.
