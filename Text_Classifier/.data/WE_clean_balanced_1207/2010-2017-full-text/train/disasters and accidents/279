Magnitude 4.7 and 4.8 Earthquakes Shake Oklahoma 30 Seconds Apart; 30 Quakes Reported in 19 Hours
A pair of moderate earthquakes shook northwest Oklahoma late Wednesday night, part of a swarm of Sooner State temblors that has produced more than two dozen quakes in less than 24 hours.
The twin earthquakes occurred at 10:27 p.m. CST Wednesday night and were felt from central Kansas to southern Oklahoma and the eastern Texas panhandle, including in Wichita, Kansas, and the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.
KWTV said some of its viewers reported damage in their homes. 
There were no reported injuries in either Majors or Woods Counties, near the epicenter of the twin quakes, according to newsok.com. 
The 4.8-magnitude quake was the strongest in the Sooner State since the November 2011 swarm that included the state's strongest on record, a 5.6-magnitude temblor in Prague on Nov. 6, 2011. It was the fourth strongest quake on record in Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS).
This was one of 30 separate earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or greater reported in Oklahoma within a 19-hour span from Wednesday evening through early Thursday afternoon. Twenty-seven of those, including the two strongest quakes mentioned above, were clustered in southern Woods County. Two others were reported in the far northern Oklahoma City metropolitan area east-northeast of Edmond, and a third occurred around midday Thursday near Perry in north-central Oklahoma.
In 2015, 907 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater were reported in Oklahoma, up from 584 in 2014, according to KFOR-TV.
There were only 42 such earthquakes in the state in 2010 and 1 such tremor in 2005.
According to the USGS, there have been 30 such earthquakes already in 2016, the most recent being a preliminary magnitude-4.0 tremor near Fairview at 1:59 p.m. Thursday.
