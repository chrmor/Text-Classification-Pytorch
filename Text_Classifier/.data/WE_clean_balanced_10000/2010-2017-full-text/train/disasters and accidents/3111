Thomson Majesty cruise ship accident leaves five dead
Five crew have been killed and three others injured after a lifeboat they were in fell from a cruise ship docked in the port of Santa Cruz de la Palma in the Canary Islands during a routine safety drill.
Those killed include three Indonesians, a Filipino and a Ghanaian.
The ship, believed to be the MS Thomson Majesty, is operated by UK-based Thomson Cruises.
The BBC's Tom Burridge says Spanish media reports suggest that a winch lowering the boat broke or became loose, causing it to plummet.
