Graham Poll: Mark Clattenburg got two big calls wrong in Chelsea v Manchester United
Chelsea will feel understandably aggrieved at losing as the two biggest calls went against them.
First, referee Mark Clattenburg judged that Fernando Torres had simulated contact and gone to ground in the 68th minute following a Jonny Evans challenge.

Then, with only nine players defending for all they were worth, Javier Hernandez was allowed to score from a clearly offside position when he diverted in Rafael’s shot.
Torres was lucky to be on the pitch after a wild challenge on Tom Cleverley — for which he was booked — and Clattenburg, who was having a superb game, had a clear view of the Torres-Evans incident.
He awarded a free-kick to Manchester United for simulation by Torres, a second yellow card followed and the Chelsea striker was off.
But replays showed that Evans had made contact with Torres and so, according to clear instructions to referees, Clattenburg was wrong.
When there is contact, even minimal, a yellow card must not be shown.
