Microsoft Fires Antitrust Complaint Against Google
BRUSSELS—Adopting the role of hunter after being hunted for years, Microsoft Corp. lodged an antitrust complaint against rival Google Inc. with the same European authorities who last decade fined Microsoft billions of dollars.
The Microsoft complaint—its first ever, the company's top lawyer says—is rich with symbolism about how far the high-tech tides have shifted in a decade, and about how the battle for the lucrative Internet search market is being fought.
