South African commuter train crash injures 150
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - At least 150 people, including children, were injured on Thursday when two commuter trains collided near the South African capital of Pretoria, emergency services said.
The accident occurred when a train crashed into a stationary locomotive near Attridgeville, a suburb west of Pretoria.
“Many are walking wounded and already left. There are 20 people in serious condition and one, the driver of the second train, is in a critical condition,” local emergency services spokesman Johan Pieterse said.
Train services had been interrupted as a result of the accident, whose cause was being investigated, he added.
South Africa signed a $5.8 billion contract with France’s Alstom in December to supply 3,600 new train cars as part of a 10-year program to overhaul its ageing rail network.
