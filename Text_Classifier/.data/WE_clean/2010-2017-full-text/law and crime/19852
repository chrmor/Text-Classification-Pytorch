The suspect may be affiliated with a gang but it's not known if the shooting was gang-related or "a personal beef," Simpson said. An argument may have preceded the shooting.
The suspect was described as a male in his late teens or early 20s and he was accompanied by two other males in the same age range.
He said the police department's gang task force was investigating. Agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also arrived to assist, he said.
The school system website says The school system website says Rosemary Anderson High enrolls about 200 at-risk students who "have either been expelled or dropped out of public high school and many are homeless."
All the shooting victims were students at the school or had taken job training or been enrolled in other programs there, Simpson said. The victims were breathing, conscious and talking as they were transported to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Simpson said.
Nearby Jefferson High School and Portland Community College were locked down as police sought the shooter, authorities said, but the lockdown was lifted after a few hours.
"The young man I know attends our church frequently who is, according to my understanding, not involved in any criminal activity, he is a bright young man," said Jason Nelson of Cornerstone Community Church of God in Christ. "You hear about shootings every day and when it comes close to your school it's heartbreaking."
