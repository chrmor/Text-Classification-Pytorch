FIFA Probes Treatment of North Korea Soccer Squad, AFP Reports
FIFA President Sepp Blatter said soccer’s governing body is investigating reports North Korea’s World Cup squad was publicly humiliated and head coach Kim Jong Hun sentenced to hard labor, Agence France-Presse reported.
FIFA this week sent a letter to North Korea’s soccer association requesting details about its election of a new president and “to find out if allegations made by the media that the coach and some players were condemned and punished are true,” AFP cited Blatter as saying today in Singapore.
“We are doing this as a first step and we will see how they answer,” the news agency cited Blatter as saying.
North Korea lost all three group games in South Africa, its first appearance at the World Cup since 1966.
