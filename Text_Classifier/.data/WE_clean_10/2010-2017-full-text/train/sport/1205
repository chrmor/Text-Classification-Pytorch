Galway, Kilkenny, Dublin and Tipperary prepare for historic replays
For the first time ever, the All Ireland Senior and Minor Hurling finals will be replayed today on the same day.
Dublin are taking on Tipperary in the minor final at a 1.15pm. Then at 3.30pm, Killkenny take on Galway in the senior final.
More than 82,000 people are expected to pack into Croke Park to see both games, and traffic around the stadium in Dublin is expected to be busy.
Galway manager Anthony Cunningham is hoping the experience of an All Ireland final last day out will stand to them today.
"The proof of the pudding is in the performance, but (having being in this position before) is a big plus for us," he said.
"We've got experienceâ€¦but you'll need all the experience from all your years of hurling to beat Kilkenny."
If Kilkenny win, Henry Shefflin will win his ninth All-Ireland medal, and would become the first man in either football or hurling to do so on the field of play.
