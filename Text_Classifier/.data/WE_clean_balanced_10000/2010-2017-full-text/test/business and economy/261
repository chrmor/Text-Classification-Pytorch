Its services include voice, broadband, Internet access, hosted services, managed services, wireless voice, wireless data and other communications, cloud and managed services.
Cbeyond Inc. stockholders will receive between $9.97 and $10 per share. That translates to an approximately 41 percent premium over the company's Thursday closing price of $7.07.
Shares of Cbeyond surged $2.77, or 39 percent, to $9.85 in premarket trading Monday about 30 minutes ahead of the market open.
Both Atlanta-based companies' boards unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close within six months.
The transaction still needs approval from federal and state regulators and Cbeyond stockholders.
