Ukip leadership favourite in hospital after clash with colleague, as Nigel Farage says it was 'one of those things that happens between men'
A clash between two Ukip MEPs  which ended up with one of them in hospital was “one of those things that happens between men”, Nigel Farage has said.
The acting Ukip leader said that he fearedSteven Woolfe, the front-runner in the party’s leadership contest, would die after he collapsed following an “altercation” with a fellow MEP in the European Parliament.
There were allegations that he had been punched in the face. The married father-of-one, who is 49 today, fell over during the encounter and banged his head. 
He had two “epileptic-like fits” and complained of numbness on his left side, before collapsing two hours after the row on Thursday morning.
