One killed as passenger train derails near Brussels
One person is dead and 20 are injured after a passenger train derailed close to Brussels.
The train jumped the tracks shortly after departing from the station in Leuven, 12 miles east of the Belgian capital.
Images from the scene show one of the carriages lying on its side, as rescue workers and emergency crews rushed to the scene.
Leuven mayor Louis Tobback said the person who died was most likely not on the train itself, but was caught on or near the rails.
Two of those injured were reported to be in a serious condition. Mr Tobback said most were only slightly hurt.
Prime Minister Charles Michel had arrived at the scene, reports said.
Reports said the Brussels-bound train was travelling at a low speed since it had just left the station.
Services between Leuven and Brussels were suspended.
Authorities launched an investigation into the cause of the derailing, which was not immediately known.
