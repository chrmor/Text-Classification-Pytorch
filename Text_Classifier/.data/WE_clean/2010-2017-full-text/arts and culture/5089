Oscars: Colin Firth wins for lead actor
Colin Firth won the Oscar for lead actor for his performance in “The King’s Speech” at the 83rd Academy Awards on Sunday night. The 50-year-old British actor was the odds-on favorite to pick up his first Oscar. He portrays England’s Prince Albert, who struggles to stop his stuttering before being crowned as King George VI.
Firth breezed through the award season, collecting a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA (the British equivalent of the Academy Award), as well as top honors from the majority of critics’ groups.
Firth was competing against Jesse Eisenberg for “The Social Network,” Oscar co-host James Franco for “127 Hours,” Jeff Bridges for “True Grit” and Javier Bardem for “Biutiful.”
The Academy Awards are taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood and are being televised live on ABC. We'll carry all the breaking news and reaction here on Awards Tracker.
