Policeman Found Guilty of 15 Year Old's Murder
The policeman Epaminondas Korkoneas has been found guilty of murder by the court of Amfissa.  He was sentenced regarding the killing of 15 year old Alexandros Grigoropoulos in Athens on December 6 2008.  Grigoropoulos’ death led to lengthy and violent protests. The policeman’s colleague Vassili Saraliotis was found guilty of assisting the murder. The court has sentenced Korkoneas to life imprisonment.  Vassilis Saraliotis was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Both officers are expected to appeal. Two of the three judges and one of the four jurors voted for Korkoneas to be sentenced with a lighter charge of manslaughter with possible intent; this would have carried a lighter sentence. The defence team of 38 year old Korkoneas stated that he fired a shot in the air in response to aggrivations from a group of teens that included Grigoropoulos. The forensic doctor ascertained that the gunshot which hit the thorax of the victim hadn’t bounce anywhere before.  The doctor stated that the weapon was aimed at a person’s height; as suggested by witnesses, who also ruled out any provocation by the young student.
