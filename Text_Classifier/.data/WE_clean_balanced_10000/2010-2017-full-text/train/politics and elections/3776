Sudan sets timetable for referendum
Sudan on Tuesday set November 14 as the start date for voter registration in a historic vote on independence for the south, but fears remain about the amount of time left to organise the referendum.
"The timeframe is a really big problem," said Chan Reec, deputy chairman of the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission. "We are doing what is humanly possible."
Under a 2005 peace agreement that ended Africa's longest-running civil war, the south is to vote on January 9 on whether to become independent or to remain part of a united Sudan.
Most analysts expect voters to opt to break away but there have been no large-scale independent opinion polls.
Progress on preparing the vote has been seriously delayed and many observers have expressed fears that the process will not be completed on time.
"Registration will start on 14 November and continue for three weeks, and will end on 4 December," said Reec, who also heads the referendum commission's bureau in the south.
