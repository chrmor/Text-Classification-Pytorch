Rebel Irish government MP resigns-spokeswoman
DUBLIN, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Rebel Irish senior government party MP Jim McDaid has resigned from parliament, his parliamentary office confirmed on Tuesday.
McDaid, who was stripped of his Fianna Fail party privileges for voting against the government two years ago, stepped down for personal reasons, a spokeswoman at his office told Reuters.
His resignation cuts Prime Minister Brian Cowenâ€™s majority in parliament to three seats before he tries to push through the first of four rounds of fresh austerity cuts in December and brings the number of vacant lower-house seats to four.
