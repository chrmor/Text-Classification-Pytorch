Tribunal publishes warrants in Hariri case
LEIDSCHENDAM, Netherlands, Aug. 17 (UPI) -- The Special Tribunal for Lebanon made public Wednesday the arrest warrants of four suspects accused of ties to the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri.
The tribunal recently released the names of those accused of having a role in the 2005 assassination of Hariri, a former Lebanese prime minister. The suspects -- Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, Hussein Hassan Ainessi and Assad Hassan Sabra -- are allegedly members of Hezbollah.
Beirut said recently it was unable to make arrests in relation to tribunal requests. Tribunal Judge Antonio Cassese, in a statement, said the next step might include more public revelations regarding the indictment.
The tribunal made the arrest warrants public Wednesday. Ayyash and Badreddine, the warrants say, are accused of terrorism as co-perpetrators in the "intentional homicide" of Hariri. The other two suspects are accused of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and acting as accomplices in the assassination.
All are implicated in the deaths of the more than 20 other people killed in the attack on Hariri's motorcade in Beirut.
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the slain prime minister's son, in statements published by The Daily Star newspaper in Lebanon called on Hezbollah to cooperate.
"What we ask of Hezbollah is simply to detach itself from the accused, a move that would be considered a historic one among all Muslims and Arabs," he was quoted as saying. "Any other stance would accomplish the opposite for Hezbollah and its leaders."
