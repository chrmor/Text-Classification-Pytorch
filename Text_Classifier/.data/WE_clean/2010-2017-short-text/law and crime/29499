Venezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice upholds the 13-year, 9-month-plus prison term of Popular Will party founder Leopoldo López for inciting violence, via "subliminal messages," at the 2014 anti-government protests where 43 people were killed. Yesterday, United States President Donald Trump met with López's wife, Lilian Tintori, and called on Venezuela to release López immediately. (Latin American Herald Tribune) (Reuters) (Heavy.com)
