Tunisia under attack by Anonymous; press release
"And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all  records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became  truth. 'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the  future: who controls the present controls the past.'" - George Orwell, 1984, Book 1, Chapter 3
A time for truth has come. A time for people to express themselves freely and to be heard from anywhere in the world. The Tunisian governement wants to control the present with falsehoods and misinformation in order to impose the future by keeping the truth hidden from its citizens. We will not remain silent while this happens. Anonymous has heard the claim for freedom from the Tunisian people. Anonymous is willing to help the tunisian people in this fight against opression.
This is a warning to the Tunisian Government: violation of the freedom of speech and information of its citizens will not be tolerated. Attacks will continue until the Tunisian Government respects all Tunisian citizens right to Free Speech and Information and ceases the censoring of the internet.
It's in the hands of the Tunisian governement to stop this situation. Free the net and attacks will cease. Continue your oppression and this will just be the begining.
We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.
