49 servers shut in Euro police raid on online piracy network
Police shut down 49 servers and detained 10 people in a Europe-wide raid in 13 countries against an online film pirating network, the Belgian prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The operation, organised after a two-year investigation by Belgian police, was aimed at "groups pirating films and TV series in Dutch or international productions sub-titled in that language."
The raids on Tuesday night, coordinated by Belgian police and European authorities, hit Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary, said spokesman Jean-Marc Meilleur.
He said police searched 57 high-capacity servers managed by four big release, or distribution, groups that together account for 80 percent of all new Dutch films downloaded illegally.
Losses incurred by the industry due to the illicit downloads are estimated at around 30 million euros a year in Belgium (38 million US dollars) and six billion worldwide, the spokesman said.
Police made 10 detentions in Belgium, Norway, Sweden and Poland. "They were the leaders of the four groups," Meilleur said.
