Taoiseach Brian Cowen has said the Irish government will defeat a motion of no confidence put forward by the Labour Party in the Dail.
"Yesterday is passed, we have reassigned some responsibilities to existing ministers," he said.
Mr Cowan made the comments at a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh on Friday.
The meeting was hosted by the NI First and Deputy First Ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness.
