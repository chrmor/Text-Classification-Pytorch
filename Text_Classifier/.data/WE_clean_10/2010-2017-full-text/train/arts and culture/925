Stone Roses announce 2013 gigs
Band will play London's Finsbury Park on 7 and 8 June, and Glasgow Green on 15 June
The Stone Roses have announced three new British gigs, including their first official London concert since the band announced their reunion.
Following concerts in Australia next spring, the Stone Roses will play two shows at London's Finsbury Park, on 7 and 8 June 2013, and then at Glasgow Green on 15 June. The band previously described their 1990 performance at Glasgow Green as one of their best concerts.
While the Stone Roses did play an intimate London date in early August, this was a secret show at the Adidas Underground. Jimmy Page, Bobby Gillespie, Jessica Ennis and Bradley Wiggins were in attendance.
Tickets go on sale at 9:30am on Friday 2 November (and can be purchased via the Guardian). Fans had better be quick: the Stone Roses' summer gigs at Heaton Park entered the Guinness World Records as the fastest-selling rock concerts in British history. All 220,000 tickets were snapped up within 68 minutes.
