Ireland's Fine Gael and Labour set to enter coalition
Agreement reached after talks between the parties went on into the early hours
Fine Gael and Labour are inching closer to an agreement on forming the next government in Dublin.
Labour delegates are meeting in the city this afternoon to endorse a plan to enter into coalition with Enda Kenny's party.
The special delegate conference is taking place at University College Dublin, while Fine Gael will hold a meeting of its members at the Shelbourne hotel.
Talks between Kenny and Labour leader Eamon Gilmore went on to 1am on Sunday and afterwards both parties said they had concluded an agreement.
Gilmore said he intends to recommend the package to the Labour delegate conference. He stressed that final drafting work on the proposed programme for government was continuing.
Gilmore said how many ministers each party would have would be decided before Wednesday.
Neither leader would say what timetable had been agreed to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP, which was a key area of difference in the parties' approach to economic recovery during the election campaign.
Fine Gael believes Ireland should adhere to the conditions set down by the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, which want to see Ireland drive down its national debt by 2014. During the election campaign, however, Labour said it would prefer a target of 2016 to give the economy more time to recover from the recession and the impact of severe cuts in public spending.
If both parties back the agreement, Kenny will be elected taoiseach on Wednesday and Gilmore will become tánaiste (deputy prime minister). For Gilmore his elevation to the second most powerful post in the land will mark a remarkable political journey from student revolutionary with Official Sinn Féin (later the Marxist Workers party) in the 1970s and 80s, to a leading position in a government with the centre-right, Christian Democrat-aligned Fine Gael.
