Birmingham City's Carson Yeung quizzed by Hong Kong police
Birmingham City FC's president Carson Yeung is helping police in Hong Kong with criminal investigations, according to the club's website.
A statement put out by acting chairman Peter Pannu said Mr Yeung was assisting police in Hong Kong.
He said he believed the inquiries were nothing to do with the club's parent company or subsidiaries.
Birmingham International Holdings' lawyers had informed him of the situation, he said.
He said he had also been informed by the lawyers that Mr Yeung was assisting with inquiries that had nothing to do with BIHL in Hong Kong and therefore nothing to do with the operation of club.
"People are reminded that in recent years members of the previous board were placed on bail for a significant amount of time and nothing came of it," the statement said.
"I am only using this as an example to calm any fears."
The statement also said the law says a person is innocent until proven guilty and that until the club found out any more information there would be no further comment.
