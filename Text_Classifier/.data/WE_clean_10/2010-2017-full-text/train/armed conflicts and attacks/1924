Beirut (AFP) - An Islamic State group suicide bomber killed at least 20 regime troops in Hasakeh city in northeast Syria on Friday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.
"The attack by a booby-trapped car targeted the criminal security service headquarters in the south of the city" where deadly clashes have been under way since Thursday, the Britain-based monitor said.
