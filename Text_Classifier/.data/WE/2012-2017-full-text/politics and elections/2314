South Korea Postpones Signing Military Data Pact With Japan
SEOUL, South Korea — Faced with mounting political pressure at home, the South Korean government on Friday abruptly postponed the signing of its first military cooperation pact with Japan since World War II.
Now the fate of the agreement has become uncertain as South Korea’s political parties look ahead to a presidential election later this year.
The government and opposition parties agreed Friday to convene the National Assembly on Monday, and the Foreign Ministry said the session would give it a chance to explain and seek parliamentary support for the pact.
The opposition and other government critics bitterly accused the government of trying to rush the agreement through without adequate public debate.
“We have decided to push for the signing after consultations with the National Assembly,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The deal had been hailed as a significant step by the two governments. Both countries have been struggling to overcome the historical bitterness between their peoples and to cooperate more closely on mutual security matters in the region. The pact provides a legal framework for South Korea and Japan to share and protect classified military data so they can deal more effectively with the threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and China’s growing military influence.
