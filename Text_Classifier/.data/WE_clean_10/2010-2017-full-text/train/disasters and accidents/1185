Capsized boat leaves dozens dead
LAKE ALBERT, Uganda, Aug. 2 (UPI) -- A boat capsized in Uganda's Lake Albert Monday killing at least 33, with dozens still missing, police said.
Severe weather is believed to have caused the accident after midnight on the lake, which marks the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Radio France Internationale reported Monday.
A police spokesman said waters are notoriously rough in the lake and boats are often not properly maintained and not equipped with life jackets.
Seventeen people survived the capsize, and the search is continuing for more, police spokesman Vincent Ssekate told RFI. The boat's carrying capacity is 40, but it was probably carrying considerably more, he said.
A government-controlled publication reported there were more than 90 people aboard. Last month another boat, carrying passengers and food products capsized on Lake Victoria while attempting to reach a mainland port in Entebbe.
