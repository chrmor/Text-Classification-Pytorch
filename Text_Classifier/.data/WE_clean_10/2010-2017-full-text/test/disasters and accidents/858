UPDATE 1-Iran reports 6.1 earthquake west of Shiraz
TEHRAN, Sept 27 (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and three people were injured after a 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit southern Iran on Monday, Iranian media reported.
The Iranian Seismological Centre reported that the quake hit at 11:22 GMT at a depth of 8 km (5 miles) in Konar Takhteh, west of the city of Shiraz. The U.S. Geological Survey reported a 5.7 magnitude quake west of Shiraz.
“Based on latest reports, today’s earthquake has left at least one person dead and three others injured,” the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
A provincial official said “some old buildings” in two nearby villages were also damaged.
Iran, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, is criss-crossed by major faultlines and is frequently hit by earthquakes. In 2008 a magnitude 6.1 quake struck Bandar Abbas, on the mainland near the southern Qeshm island, killing at least seven people and injuring 40.
An earthquake in 2003 flattened the desert citadel city of Bam and killed 31,000 people.
