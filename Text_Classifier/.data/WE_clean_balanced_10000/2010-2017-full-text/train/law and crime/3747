Malmo attack: One dead and three injured  as bomb found outside school
Witnesses reported hearing 20 gunshots fired in bursts of three during a football derby at around 7pm local time between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF on Sunday.  One eyewitness claimed the shots were fired by people in an Audi which drove off at high speed.  Police found shell casings at the scene in Censorgatan and say the suspects may have escaped by moped – four people were injured, including one who was shot in the head.
Officers are treating the incident as attempted murder.  Police spokeswoman Ewa-Gun Westford said one person had died following the incident.  She said: “A young man had died from the injuries.” A police helicopter in the area for the football match was deployed to search for the suspects. 
Several loud bangs were heard and witnesses told The Local that two people were then carried away to cars, which then fled the scene.  One witness said: “The feet were sticking out of the car windows.” An explosion was then heard at Helenholm, a suburb of Malmo, at around 9pm local time, but this is now understood to have caused by fireworks.
The unrest came only hours after a suspicious device was spotted outside a primary school in Gothenburg, stoking fears Sweden was being targeted by extremists. Police have now confirmed the item they found was a bomb.  Spokesman Thomas Fuxborg said: “We suspect that it is a pipe bomb. "We belive it was real, but I do not know how sharp it was, or how it would have been activated.”
