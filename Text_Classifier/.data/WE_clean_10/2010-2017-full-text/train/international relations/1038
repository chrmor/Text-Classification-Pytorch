WikiLeaks' Assange 'dressed as old woman' to evade CIA
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disguised himself as an old woman in order to evade US intelligence officers who he believed were following him, extracts from a new biography revealed Monday.
Further passages from "WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy," written by Guardian newspaper journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding, also showed that the hacker did not know his biological father until the age of 27.
Assange gained international notoriety in November 2010 when his WikiLeaks website began publishing over 250,000 leaked US diplomatic cables.
The Australian-born hacker was in England at the time and became convinced that CIA agents were following him, despite "no obvious signs of pursuit," the book claimed.
"You can't imagine how ridiculous it was," WikiLeaks's James Ball told the authors. "He'd stayed dressed up as an old woman for more than two hours."
Excerpts from the biography, published in the Guardian, exposed Assange's unusual childhood and his complicated parental situation.
