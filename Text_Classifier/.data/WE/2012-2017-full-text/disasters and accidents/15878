Video: Two pilots killed as jet crashes at Indonesia air show
Two pilots were killed on Sunday when an Indonesian jet fighter taking part in an aerobatic show crashed and burst into flames.
The KAI T-50 Golden Eagle spun out of control and crashed into an air force base complex near Adi Sutjipto Airport in Yogyakarta on Java island.
Amateur video obtained by Metro TV showed plumes of black smoke billowing from the wreckage as the plane burst into flames.
The pilot and co-pilot - both Indonesians - died instantly, but no one on the ground was injured.
An investigation team was sent to the crash site, Air Force officials said.
The crash occurred on the second day of an air show celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Air Force Flight School in Yogyakarta.
The KAI T-50, a US-South Korean-made light attack aircraft, is one of 16 similar models bought by the Indonesian air force last year.
