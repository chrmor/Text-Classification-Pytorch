Veterans Pledge to Protect Protesters
Groups of U.S. military veterans are descending on the Standing Rock oil pipeline protest, vowing to act as “human shields” against possible clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement.
The commitment comes as protesters defied orders to immediately leave the site in North Dakota, where authorities have cited “severe” winter conditions as the reason they must evacuate.
North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple has ordered the protesters to leave immediately, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — which has jurisdiction over the land — has set a deadline for Monday.
But protesters keep flocking to the site, despite the orders and the worsening conditions. More than 2,000 people have arrived this week despite a blizzard that left more than a foot of snow on the ground, according to protester Daniel Grassrope and three other people at the camp who spoke to NBC News.
Among the newcomers are large groups of U.S. military veterans who have said they will protect the protesters if violence breaks out at the camp, located in Cannon Ball.
