Gas leaks reported throughout the city after severe storms swept through the area today.
A strong odor of natural gas has been smelled by residents along the U.S. 31 corridor in Gardendale and Fultondale, but other areas are affected as well.
An Alagasco spokeswoman said that when trees are uprooted from strong winds, it can cause gas lines to leak.
Sherri Goodman said the state's largest natural gas utility has been responding to such calls all day.
