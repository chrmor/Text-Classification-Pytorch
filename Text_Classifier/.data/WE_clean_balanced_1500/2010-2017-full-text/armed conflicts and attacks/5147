Israel anxiously monitoring Egypt, other regional states
JERUSALEM: Israel is "anxiously monitoring" the developments in Egypt, it's most important ally in the Arab world, and other Muslim states of the region as the tremors on Cairo are likely to have far reaching consequences on the Jewish state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet today that Israel must exercise responsibility and restraint in the face of the unrest in Egypt, and that Jerusalem's primary concern was to preserve the more than 30 years of stability and peaceful ties with Cairo. "We are anxiously monitoring what is happening in Egypt and [elsewhere] in our region. Our efforts are designed to continue and maintain stability and security in our region. I remind you that the peace between Israel and Egypt has endured for over three decades and our goal is to ensure that these relations continue", Netanyahu told his ministers. "Of course, at this time, we must show maximum responsibility, restraint and sagacity and, to this end, I have instructed my fellow ministers to refrain from commenting on this issue", he added. Protests against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's rule have worried the Jewish state, which signed a peace treaty with its largest Arab ally in 1979, and uncertainty over the West backed regime has raised fears about stability in the region. The Israeli Premier said that he had spoken to US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton overnight, after which he had held consultations with defence minister Ehud Barak, foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, and senior intelligence officials. Even though the Israeli government has acted with restraint and made no comments on the emerging situation in Egypt, analysts in the media have been focusing on various possibilities in the aftermath of a regime change in Cairo. The Tel Aviv stock market slumped today as images of escalating violence and chaos in Egypt gripped investor fear and raised concerns the protests would spread across the Middle East. Foreign investors have pulled out of their investments in the region and are selling stocks and shekels fast, resulting in TA-25 dropping 2.7% to rate of 1296 points, and TA-100 fell 3% to 1202 points. The Banks-5 index fell 3.4% and the Real Estate-15 index dropped by 5%. The Israeli suspicion is that under the surface of the Egyptian struggle, which is on the face about economics and democracy, lies an Islamic element, a columnist wrote in daily Ha'aretz today.
