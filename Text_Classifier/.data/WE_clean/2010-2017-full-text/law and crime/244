Man commits suicide after killing three in court
YONGZHOU - A man killed himself after shooting three judges dead and injuring another three judges in a local court office Tuesday in central China's Hunan Province, said local authorities.
The incident happened at about 10:05 a.m. at Lingling District People's Court in Yongzhou City, said the city's public security department.
The gunman, Zhu Jun, barged into an office on the fourth floor of the court building. He shot the judges in the office before killing himself, police said.
Zhu, 46, was head of the security squad of the China Post branch bureau of Lingling District.
Around 7:30 a.m., Zhu took a submachine gun and two pistols from his subordinate after saying he would have the guns examined by the higher authorities, police said.
Zhu, who had a son, divorced his wife three years ago. He lived with his parents, an initial police investigation showed.
The investigation showed Zhu committed the attack to take revenge on the court.
Zhu's family and colleagues told police Zhu thought the court unjustly handled the property division when the couple divorced three years ago.
The victims were not involved in Zhu's divorce case, police said.
Zhu was on sick leave at home for two months and only came back to work three days ago, they said.
