Headlines for December 28, 2012
President Obama is set to meet with congressional leaders at the White House just three days before a year-end deadline to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Some $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases will take effect if no agreement is reached. Obama and congressional Republicans remain at an impasse over the Republican refusal to allow tax hikes even for the wealthiest Americans. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused House Speaker John Boehner of holding up a deal.
Sen. Harry Reid: “The American people, I don’t think, understand the House of Representatives is operating without the House of Representatives. It’s being operated with a dictatorship of the speaker not allowing the vast majority of the House of Representatives to get what they want.”
Adding to the sense of urgency surrounding the talks, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner warned this week the United States will not be able to pay its creditors after Monday unless the debt ceiling is raised.
