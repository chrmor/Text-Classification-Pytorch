Al and Tipper Gore are separating
Another sad sign today of the toll that public life can take on families: Former vice president Al Gore and wife Tipper have announced they are separating.
"This is very much a mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together following a process of long and careful consideration," the couple said in an e-mail to family and friends. We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further."
Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider confirmed the contents of the e-mail.

The news is being greeted with shock in Washington, D.C. Few political couples seemed as close as the Gores back during his vice presidential years, 1993 to 2001. And remember the ardent kiss Gore planted on his wife at the 2000 Democratic National Convention? See a video clip of that moment below.
The Gores have been married for 40 years.
