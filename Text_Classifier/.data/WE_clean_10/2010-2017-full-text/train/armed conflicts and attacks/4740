Bodies found in search for victims of Bosnian massacre
The bodies of more than 50 people have been found in a lake by investigators searching for victims of the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
The discovery was made on the shores of Lake Perucac on the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.
It is part of an ongoing investigation by Bosnia's International Commission for Missing Persons.
Most of the bodies are believed to date from a massacre of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) in the town of Visegrad.
More than 1,000 people were killed by Serb forces in the town during an act of so-called "ethnic cleansing" in the spring of 1992.
Judges at the Hague tribunal investigating acts of genocide in the Bosnian war described the Visegrad massacre as "one of the most comprehensive campaigns of ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian conflict".
Two Bosnian Serb commanders, Milan and Sredoje Lukic, were found guilty in 2009 of war crimes.
They were accused of persecution, extermination and other inhumane acts - including burning women, children and elderly men alive - in the Visegrad region between 1992 and 1994.
Visegrad and Lake Perucac lie in what is now the largely self-governing Bosnian Serb entity of Republika Srpska.
Before the war, more than half of the town's population were Bosniaks.
It is not the first time that the lake - a dammed section of the River Drina - has thrown up grim discoveries.
In 2001 a mass grave of 60 bodies was found, thought to be Kosovo Albanians killed during the 1999 conflict in Kosovo.
