East Palo Alto McDonald's Shooting Injures Five
EAST PALO ALTO -- Five people were shot at a bus stop in broad daylight Sunday afternoon outside a busy McDonald's on University Avenue, a fire official said.
No motive was immediately known, authorities said. Officers were called after 2:48 p.m. on a report of a person shot in the foot at the McDonald's at 2401 University Ave. near Bay Road, according to Menlo Park fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman.
Firefighters arrived and found five people with gunshot wounds.
Police said the victims were shot while waiting at the bus stop on Bay Road, which parallels the west side of the restaurant.
Four of the victims were young Hispanic males and the fifth was an elderly Hispanic woman, who was with a 6-year-old child.
The victims were all transported to Stanford University Medical Center to be treated for minor injuries, Norden said.
A preliminary investigation revealed the victims had been waiting for a bus at the bus stop when a gray or silver-colored small car approached from northbound Bay Road, said Detective John Norden.
The car stopped directly in front of the bus stop, then several shots were fired at the victims from the inside of the vehicle.
Most of the victims were struck in their lower extremities, Schapelhouman said.
"Obviously this is a pretty brazen incident, to do this in daylight," he said.
East Palo Alto Police, including Chief Ronald Davis, were on the scene investigating, Schapelhouman
