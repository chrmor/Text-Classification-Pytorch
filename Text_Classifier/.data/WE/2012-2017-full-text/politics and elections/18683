Will Malcolm and Bill survive? It's all about the margin
The size of the win or loss by Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten will determine how secure they are in their positions and shape the Australian political landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.
For Turnbull, a win that reduces the Coalition's House of Representatives majority to a single figure will diminish his authority and increase the prospect of internal tensions, outbreaks of ill-discipline and even insurrection.
Such an outcome would suggest the industrial legislation that was the trigger for this double dissolution will struggle to pass at the joint sitting that will follow â€“ a humiliating rebuff to the returned prime minister.
With the prospect of an even bigger and more unwieldy crossbench in the Senate under the voting reforms Turnbull championed, a narrow win would also offer no guarantee that the company tax cuts that are the centrepiece of the Coalition's campaign will be legislated.
