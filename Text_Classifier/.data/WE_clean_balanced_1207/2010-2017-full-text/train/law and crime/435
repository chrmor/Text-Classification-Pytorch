Aberdeen schoolboy dead and teenager arrested following 'stabbing' at Cults Academy
A schoolboy has died after he was reportedly stabbed at a secondary school in Aberdeen.
Police said they were called to the Cults Academy at 1.30pm on Wednesday afternoon, amid unverified reports the victim had been stabbed by another pupil at lunchtime. Another male, reportedly aged 16, has been detained.
The fifth-year pupil was taken by ambulance to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, but died a short time later, according to Scottish media reports and Sky News.
In a statement, Police Scotland confirmed only that the victim had been taken to hospital, and that the boy's next of kin had been informed. NHS Grampian was unable to confirm that the boy had died.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "One male pupil has been taken by ambulance to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with serious injuries.
"A further male has been detained and is currently assisting officers with their inquiries.
"Inquiries into the circumstances of the incident are ongoing and officers will remain at the scene for the time being."
An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of a serious incident at Cults Academy today. Police are on site.
"Due to the nature of this incident, we will not be issuing further comment."
