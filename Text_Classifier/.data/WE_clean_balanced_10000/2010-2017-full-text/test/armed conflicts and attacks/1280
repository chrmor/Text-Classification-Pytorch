Dhaka cafe standoff: At least 13 hostages rescued
(CNN)Bangladeshi troops rescued at least 13 hostages and shot dead six gunmen Saturday, ending an overnight siege at a cafe in Dhaka, officials said.
"The operation is over," said Brig. Gen. Mujibur Rahman, who was overseeing the troops in the rescue effort at Holey Artisan Bakery, which was raided by gunmen Friday night.
Its unclear how many people the gunmen seized in the cafe at a diplomatic zone, but Rahman said 14 hostages were rescued.
"We were able to save 13 people ... and of these terrorists six of them died on the spot, they died right there," Hasina said at a news conference.
• Ataur Rahman, who was in his office about 200 meters from the restaurant, said he went to the street as he heard a series of gunshots. "I thought it might be an attack somewhere nearby by local thugs." He said people were racing for cover, saying gunmen were shouting "Allahu Akbar."
• The Islamic State (ISIS) has claimed a number of past attacks in Bangladesh through its media affiliates, but the government has consistently denied any ISIS presence in the country. Other attacks have been claimed by local Islamist groups.
• Though there was the reported ISIS claim of responsibility, the U.S. State Department said it cannot yet be confirmed. Spokesman John Kirby said the State Department is assessing information.
• A U.S. official familiar with intelligence thinking told CNN's Barbara Starr that based on past operations, it is more likely that al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent is conducting this attack -- not ISIS. This is preliminary analysis -- not a conclusion -- based on the best information available. The official says AQIS has demonstrated a more capable presence in Dhaka over the past few months than ISIS, and so far, all of its attacks in Bangladesh have been in Dhaka.
Lori Ann Walsh Imdad, an American teacher living in Dhaka, said she lives one block from the restaurant. She said she heard a burst of gunfire first; after that it was sporadic.
Farzana Azim says she heard explosions outside her home. "We heard the first bomb blast at 8:30 in the evening," Azim said. At first she thought it was the sound of a plane, but a few minutes later another blast echoed through the neighborhood of Gulshan. Within a half hour, the gunshots started, she said.
I never thought something like this could happen. It is next to a small hospital. This is family-friendly restaurant. Everyone loves to go there," she said. She said her husband and son had gone outside for the call to prayer and the attack happened shortly after that.
Bergen said he had talked to a counterterrorism official who thought ISIS was to blame for the attack, and that was before the media arm made its announcement. The official said al Qaeda typically doesn't conduct operations with teams this large.
That incident was the latest in a wave of killings across Bangladesh of secular bloggers, academics and religious minorities such as Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and Sufi Muslims -- despite a nationwide government crackdown and the arrest of more than 14,000 people.
The government launched an anti-militant drive across the Muslim-majority nation last month to stamp out the murders, but many of those detained are believed to be ordinary criminals and not Islamic extremists.
Home to almost 150 million Muslims, the country until recently had avoided the kind of radicalism plaguing others parts of the world. But that's changing as the attacks seem designed to silence those to dare to criticize Islam.
Avijit Roy One high-profile killing was the murder of Bangladeshi-American writer Avijit Roy in 2014 that occurred right outside Dhaka's annual book fair. In April, a well-known LGBT activist and his friend were murdered.
