Report: Israel Agreed to 'Act With Restraint' Over Syria Attack
A Kuwaiti newspaper reported that Gulf leaders have asked that Israel act “with restraint” if attacked by Syria - and Israel agreed
A Kuwaiti newspaper reported Thursday that Gulf leaders have been in touch with Israel, and have asked that Israel act “with restraint” in the event of an attack by Western nations on Syria. That restraint would be necessary if Bashar al-Assad responds to an attack against him by attacking Israel.
Earlier this week, Syrian officials said that if Syria was attacked, a coalition of nations and terror groups, including Syria, Iran, Lebanon, and Hezbollah, would respond with an all-out attack on Israel.
According to the report, Israel responded by saying that it would indeed exercise “restraint,” as long as the attacks on Israel “did not exceed reasonable bounds.” The report did not describe what those bounds were.
A separate report said that European Union officials have warned Assad not to attack Israel if he is attacked. The warning said that the EU could not be responsible for Israel's response. The message added that any attack against Assad was not aimed at removing him from power.
