Brazil's Federal Accounts Court (TCU), in a unanimous 8-0 decision, rules that President Dilma Rousseff's government manipulated its accounts in 2014 to disguise a widening fiscal deficit. The ruling, while not legally binding, is expected to be used by opposition lawmakers who are calling for impeachment proceedings. (Reuters) (AP)
