Why we are in Libya
US President Barack Obama has defended US military action in Libya, claiming America would always look to lead the world in preventing atrocities of the type that was looming in the war-torn North African nation.
But he warned that the US could not shoulder that responsibility alone and was unable to intervene unilaterally "wherever repression occurs".
Pushing back against criticisms that he risked entrenching the nation in a third Middle East conflict inside a decade, Mr Obama claimed in a televised address that plans to establish a no-fly zone over Libya and to protect its civilians from the forces of Muammar Gaddafi were succeeding.
Stopping short of claiming "mission accomplished", he added: "Tonight, I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance."
