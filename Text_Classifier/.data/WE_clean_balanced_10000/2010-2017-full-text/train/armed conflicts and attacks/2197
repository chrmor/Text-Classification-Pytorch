Iran Closes Consulates in Turkey Following Russian Ambassador Murder
Iran has closed all of its consulates across Turkey on Tuesday, the Iranian embassy in Ankara said.
MOSCOW (Sputnik) — On Monday, Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov was killed by a gunman at an art gallery exhibition opening in Ankara. Three other people were also injured in the attack. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it considers the attack a terrorist act.
"All consular services in Iranian consulates in Istanbul, Trabzon and Erzurum will be closed on Tuesday, December 20. We urge all Iranians to avoid visiting these locations," the embassy said in a statement on its website.
The attack came just a day before Turkish, Russian and Iranian foreign ministers were due to meet in Moscow to discuss settling the Syrian conflict. The Turkish minister arrived in Moscow and decided to press on with the meeting despite the attack, stressing that the incident will not impact relations between Turkey and Russia.
