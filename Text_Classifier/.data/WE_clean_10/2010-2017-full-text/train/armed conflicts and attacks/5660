Libyan rebels say seize Brega; no confirmation
BENGHAZI, Libya, March 26 (Reuters) - Libyan rebels said on Saturday they had seized control of the oil port of Brega, but there was no independent confirmation.
Brega, site of an oil export terminal and refinery, sprawls over a large area and overall control can be hard to determine.
“Brega is 100 percent in the hands of the liberating forces,” Shamsiddin Abdulmolah, a rebel spokesman in Benghazi, said. He said forces opposed to leader Muammar Gaddafi had been driven out late on Saturday afternoon in what would have been a signficant success for the rebels.
There were no journalists in the town and no immediate independent confirmation of the rebel breakthrough.
