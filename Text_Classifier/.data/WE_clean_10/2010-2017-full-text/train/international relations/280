Russian mission in Minsk attacked
MOSCOW: Russian Embassy in Belarus' capital Minsk was attacked by petrol bombs by unidentified assailants on Tuesday, provoking a strong reaction from Moscow which termed it "outrageous". Unknown assailants threw two petrol bombs into the premises of the Russian mission in Minsk in which a car parked inside the compound was hit and there were no casualties, Russian media reported. In its reaction to the incident, the Russian foreign ministry said: "We view this incident as an outrageous act in which there is a clear desire by certain forces to interfere with the normal work of the embassy and to bring distrust and tensions to bilateral relations." It also called for a quick and thorough investigation and punishment of the people responsible. Russia and Belarus have signed a treaty for a single union state, but due to political and economic differences between the Kremlin and the former Soviet republic's authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenka, the bilateral relations are tense specially in the backdrop of a propaganda war against Lukashenka in the state-controlled Russian media. Moscow-based Biznes FM radio said Russian embassy had come under attack in Minsk in the past also when a grenade was lobbed at in May 2007 as the then President Vladimir Putin had arrived there for a CIS summit. The foreign ministry also urged Belarus to prevent such attacks in future.
