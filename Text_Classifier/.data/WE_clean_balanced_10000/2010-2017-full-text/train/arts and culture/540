Against Me! singer plays first show after announcing she is transgender
Less than a month after announcing that she is transgender, the leader of Against Me! performed for the first time under the name Laura Jane Grace. Instead of addressing her transition directly, Grace let Against Me!'s music speak for her: "You know it's obvious," she sang. "We can't choose how we're made."
Friday night's concert was a public coming-out party for Grace, who was known until recently as Tom Gabel. The 31-year-old revealed her gender dysphoria in aninterview with Rolling Stone magazine, explaining her plan to take a new name and begin living as a woman. "[I am] hoping people will understand, and hoping they'll be fairly kind," she said.
For the San Diego gig, Grace appeared in "a loose-fitting black tank top, tight black jeans and black eye shadow", Rolling Stone reported. Opening for the Cult, Against Me! "charged" through a 40-minute set, playing six new songs including True Trans Soul Rebel, Drinking with the Jocks and Transgender Dysphoria Blues. During a key moment in the 2007 song The Ocean, when Grace sang "if I could have chosen/ I would have been born a woman", the crowd erupted in applause.
"I was worried that some people expected me to come out looking like Little Bo Peep or something," Grace said after the show. She is two weeks into hormone replacement therapy.
The band went on to play concerts in Las Vegas and San Francisco on Saturday and Sunday. They perform tonight in Denver, Colorado.
