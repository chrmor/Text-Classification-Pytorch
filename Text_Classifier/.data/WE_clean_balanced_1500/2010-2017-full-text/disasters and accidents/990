Fan dies after falling at Braves-Yankees game
A man who fell from the upper deck of Atlanta's Turner Field during Saturday night's Braves-Yankees game has died, the Atlanta Braves said.
The man tumbled out of the stands during the seventh inning of the game as the New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez was walking to home plate.
"The Atlanta Braves offer their deepest condolences to the family," the team said in a statement. "At this time, all inquiries will be directed to the Atlanta Police Department, as this is an ongoing investigation."
Atlanta police are still trying to determine why the man fell, but said they do not suspect foul play. They said he is believed to be in his early 60s.
The man tumbled head over feet before hitting the concrete walkway in front of a row of fans. He hit some of the lines attached to the backstop as he fell.
CNN's Southeast Bureau chief Marylynn Ryan, who was sitting a few sections from where the man landed, said paramedics worked on him for several minutes before taking him off on an orange backboard. The game continued as fans were escorted from the section where the man lay as a medic tried CPR.
