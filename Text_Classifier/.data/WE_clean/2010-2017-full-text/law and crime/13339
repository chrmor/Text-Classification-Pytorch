John McAfee en route to US after he's deported from Guatemala
Mr McAfee, 67, had been held for the past week in a Guatemalan immigration detention centre after sneaking over the border from Belize.
Guatemalan immigration officials escorted him to the Guatemala City airport, where he boarded a flight to Miami, Florida. “I’m free, I’m going to America,” he told reporters, before the plane took off.
Police in Belize have said he is a person of interest but not a suspect in the shooting of Gregory Viant Faull, an American, there last month.
Mr McAfee was born in Britain but moved to the US as a child. He went on to make a fortune from anti-virus software which bears his name. Tonight Fernando Lucero, a spokesman for Guatemala’s immigration office, told Reuters: “Complying with migration law, Mr John McAfee is to be deported to his country of origin.”
Earlier, Telesforo Guerra, Mr McAfee’s lawyer, said he was being released from the detention centre.
Mr Guerra said that a judge had notified him verbally of the ruling.
He added: “For me, it’s best that McAfee go to the United States, that’s definitely the country where he will be safest. In Guatemala, he runs the risk that anything could happen to him.”
Mr McAfee has claimed that he is a victim of persecution by corrupt authorities in Belize and that he could face “summary execution” if he is returned there.
The Belize prime minister Dean Barrow has rejected that, describing Mr McAfee as “bonkers”.
