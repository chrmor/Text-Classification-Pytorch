G20 protesters burn Australian flag in rally on indigenous rights
A group of Indigenous protesters shocked onlookers when they began burning a number of Aussie flags.
PROTESTERS at the G20 burned Australian flags today in a demonstration over indigenous rights.
Images of the national flag going up in flames cranked up the heat on an already scorching day.
Protesters at Roma Street parklands in Brisbane city centre raised their fists in the air and chanted “resist, revive, decolonise”.
Papier mache effigies of Aboriginal representatives Warren Mundine, Noel Pearson and Marcia Langton were also torched, The Courier Mail reported.
The crowd chanted “sell outs”, calling the trio an “elitist group who had sold out their people”.
At least 100 people were present as the angry scenes unfolded ahead of the Sunday afternoon march.
Some social media users labelled the burning of the flag “outrageous” and “disgraceful”, calling on Tony Abbott to make the act illegal.
Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said he respected the right to protest but would not condone burning the Australian flag.
Activist Wayne Wharton told the Brisbane Times the demonstrators were furious at Mr Abbott’s representation of Australian history.
“He refers to this country as desolate [prior to the arrival of the first fleet],” said Mr Wharton.
“He welcomes the world leaders and tells them there was nothing. So we have to resort to symbolism to show our disgust in your colonial leadership.”
The crowd marched down Roma Street just before 1pm chanting, “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”, “They say suicide, we say murder!” and “Always has been, always will be Aboriginal land!”
Police gathered at the Gallery of Modern Art, waiting for them to reach South Brisbane.
G20 protests had up until now been relatively calm, with hundreds of police present on the final day of the summit.
There were just four arrests and 24 people banned from the CBD security zone yesterday.
