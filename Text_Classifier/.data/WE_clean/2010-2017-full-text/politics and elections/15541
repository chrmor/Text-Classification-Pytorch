Governor imposes tax on the rain
A controversial new tax for the amount of rain that falls on homes has been imposed by an environmentally-friendly governor.
The ‘storm management fee’ will be enforced in the US state of Maryland after a decree from democrat leader Martin O’Malley.
It was passed by the state legislature last year to raise revenue to comply with an order from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean-up the Chesapeake Bay estuary, according to the MarylandReporter.com
However, critics say the fees impose a financial burden on Marylanders while the state struggles to recover from recession.
They argue that it is unreasonable to expect cash-strapped citizens to pay these fees when they also have to pay more gas taxes, payroll taxes, and income taxes.
Former republican senator candidate Dan Bongino claimed the tax would be calculated ‘through satellite surveillance’.
He also criticised ‘out of touch political aristocrats in Maryland will do anything to diminish your economic liberty and starve your wallet while padding theirs’.
Fees will be calculated on the surface area of properties as the theory is that roofs, driveways and carparks create more potential for drainage problems and water contamination.
Councils are supposed to determine how much to charge per square foot, but the fee depends on the size of the building and surrounding paved surfaces.
Montgomery County democrat senator Richard Madaleno said the state could not avoid paying the expense because of deadline from the Environmental Protection Agency.
‘When I look at this amendment, I’m reminded of the saying, “You can pay me now, or you can pay me later”, he said.
