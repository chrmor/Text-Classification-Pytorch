Air Canada plane 'exits' Halifax runway while landing
An Air Canada aeroplane "exited" the runway while landing at Halifax airport, the airline says.
The A320 Airbus was carrying 133 passengers and five crew. A total of 23 were taken to hospital for observation and treatment for minor injuries.
Flight AC624 from Toronto arrived shortly after midnight (04:00 GMT) and reportedly hit a power pylon after landing.
There were stormy conditions at the time, with snow on the ground.
Power at Halifax Stanfield International Airport was knocked out but Nova Scotia Power says that it has been restored.
Passengers said the plane skidded on its undercarriage before coming to a stop.
Randy Hall told Associated Press: "We were just coming in to land and there was a big flash. The plane came down, bang! It jumped up in the air again."
Businessman Mike Magnus told the agency: "It was so chaotic at the time. I'm pretty sure the landing gear broke. The engine on my side popped off."
Passengers were taken from the plane immediately but had to stand on the tarmac in the snow until buses arrived.
Eighteen of the people taken to hospital have already been released.
Peter Spurway, a spokesman for Halifax Stanfield, said two people had required "urgent care".
