Soldier martyred in PKK attack in southeast Turkey
Baku-APA. A Turkish soldier was martyred Tuesday in a PKK terrorist attack in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir, a security source said, APA reports quoting Anadolu agency.
The soldier -- a specialized sergeant -- was attacked as he headed home.
The attack on the highway linking provincial capital Diyarbakir to Batman happened near the town of Bismil, the source said on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking to the media.
The PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization also by the U.S., and EU -- resumed its 30-year armed campaign against the Turkish state in July 2015. Since then, nearly 600 security personnel have been martyred and more than 5,000 PKK terrorists killed.
