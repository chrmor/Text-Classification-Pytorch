Two top Mubarak-era officials acquitted in Egypt
An Egyptian court has acquitted two top Hosni Mubarak-era officials of graft charges at a retrial, according to judicial sources.Â 
Former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif, and former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly were both charged with illegal profiting and squandering public funds, Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday.
Nazif and Adly had been sentenced to a one-year suspended jail term, and a five-year jail term respectively in 2011. They appealed against the verdict and the High Court ordered the retrial.
The trials of Mubarak-era figures have generally seen them cleared of charges, while liberal and Islamist activists are getting lengthy sentences.
On Monday, an Egyptian court sentenced human rights activist Alaa Abdel Fattah to five years in jail for violating limits on demonstrations during the country's 2011 uprising.
