An explosion killed at least four people and wounded 12 as they attended a funeral service in the Yemeni city of Marib, east of the capital Sanaa, local officials said.
The explosion took place as condolences were being paid after the death of Abdulrab al-Shadady, an army leader in Marib who was killed a few days ago in fighting with Houthis, the officials said.
Fighting in Yemen has intensified since UN-sponsored peace talks in Kuwait ended in August without an agreement. The fighting has been concentrated around the country’s Houthi-controlled ancient capital, Sanaa, where little territory has changed hands.
Tensions rose even further when on October 8, an air strike, widely blamed on Saudi warplanes, ripped through a wake attended by some of Yemen’s top political and security officials, killing 140 people.
