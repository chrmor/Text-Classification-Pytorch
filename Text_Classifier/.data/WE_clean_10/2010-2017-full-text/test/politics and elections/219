US vote: Cheers for Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords
The US House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a deal that would raise the limit on government borrowing.
The last-ditch deal to avoid a federal debt default was passed by 269 votes to 161.
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords made her first appearance on Capitol Hill since she was shot in Tucson in January and was greeted with cheering and applause.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said it was a privilege to call her a colleague, adding that the Congresswoman's name stirred ''love, admiration and respect''.
