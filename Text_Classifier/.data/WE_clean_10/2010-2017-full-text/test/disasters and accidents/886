Death toll rises from Indonesia flooding
Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The death toll from rampant flooding in Indonesia has climbed to 144, emergency management officials said Monday.
As of Monday morning, more than 4,300 people were displaced, and about 1,000 houses were destroyed.
About 103 people remain missing, said the national disaster management and mitigation agency. Many still rely on generators, as electricity has not been restored, the agency said.
According to the World Health Organization, a flash flood was triggered earlier this month in the Wasior subdistrict of West Papua following heavy rainfall that broke a dam.
Thousands of houses were inundated, the group said in an emergency statement report.
In addition to the destroyed houses, several buildings, numerous bridges, places of worship and schools have been damaged.
