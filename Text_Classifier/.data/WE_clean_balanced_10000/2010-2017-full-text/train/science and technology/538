China's moon rover, Jade Rabbit, has 'abnormality': state media
China's first moon rover has experienced a "mechanical control abnormality" according to the country's state media, in what appears to be a setback for a landmark mission in its ambitious space programme.
The abnormality occurred due to "the complicated lunar surface environment," the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday, citing the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND).
Scientists were "organising an overhaul", Xinhua's report added, without giving further details.
There were no reports of the abnormality on SASTIND's website.
The Jade Rabbit, or 'Yutu' in Chinese, was deployed on the moon's surface on December 15, several hours after the Chang'e-3 probe landed.
The mission makes China the third country to successfully send a lunar rover to the moon, after the United States and the former Soviet Union.
The rover's landing was the first of its kind since the former Soviet Union's mission nearly four decades ago.
China aims to create a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send someone to the Moon.
It has previously sent two probes to orbit the moon, with controllers sending the first of them crashing into the lunar surface at the end of its mission.
