Liberals Barry O'Farrell and Andrew Stoner sworn in as Premier and deputy
STATE Liberal leader Barry O'Farrell has been sworn in as NSW premier by Governor Marie Bashir.
In the brief ceremony today, NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner was sworn in as deputy premier immediately afterwards.
Mr O'Farrell's wife Rosemary and Mr Stoner's wife Cathy were both present in the NSW Chief Secretary's office to witness the ceremony. "I, Barry Robert O'Farrell, do swear that I will perform the functions and duties of premier faithfully and to the best of my ability, so help me God," Mr O'Farrell swore. "Under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and to the people of NSW." Mr Stoner swore similar oaths as deputy premier. Dr Bashir then congratulated both men. "I would like to take this opportunity now to express most warmly my congratulations to you both, Mr Premier, Mr Deputy Premier, and to wish you well on behalf of all the people of NSW," she said. After an official photograph, Dr Bashir called a brief meeting of the Executive Council, the formal governing body of the state, of which Mr O'Farrell and Mr Stoner were sworn in as members. A media conference with the new premier and deputy was due to follow that meeting.
