A man wielding a machete attacks the home of Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto, injuring one guard, 10 days before national elections. Ruto and his family were not home at the time. The assailant fled to a farm complex, reportedly hiding in an unfinished building. There are other media reports that gunmen also struck the home. (AP via The Washington Post) (Reuters)
