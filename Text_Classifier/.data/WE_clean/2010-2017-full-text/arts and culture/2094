Berlin museum breaks Nazi taboo with Hitler exhibition
The first big exhibition in Germany to focus on Adolf Hitler and his relationship with the German people is opening in Berlin.
Fears that such an exhibition might attract neo-Nazi sympathisers have put off museums until now.
Museum director Hans Ottomeyer explains why he thought the time was right to produce the display.
