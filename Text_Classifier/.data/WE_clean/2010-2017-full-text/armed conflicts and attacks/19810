Ugandan rebels wielding machetes kill 36 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
Ugandan rebels wielding machetes and axes have killed 36 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local authorities say.
The raid in the area of Beni in North Kivu province was confirmed by a military spokesman and a local official.
It comes despite vows by the government and a United Nations mission to restore security near Beni after the murder of more than 250 people since October.
Authorities have blamed the violence on the Allied Democratic Forces and National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (ADF-NALU).
The attack started about 7:00pm as some villagers were in their fields, making it harder for them to raise the alarm, said Alexis Katsurana Wakwima, head of the administrative supervision post in the nearby town of Eringeti.
Town chief Jean-Baptiste Kamabu said two people were also wounded in the attack and another two were abducted.
Celestin Ngeleka, spokesman for a military operation against armed groups in the region, said soldiers were still searching the area and could "find other cadavers".
