North Korea vows end to nonaggression pacts after U.N. vote
the U.N. vote on the new sanctions It's the latest installment in a week of furious rhetoric from the North, fueled by its anger over the U.N. vote on the new sanctions , a response to North Korea's recent nuclear test, and joint military drills by the United States and South Korea, which take place in the region each year.
"This surge in provocative rhetoric is particularly dangerous," said Michael Auslin of the American Enterprise Institute. "South Korea's new president can't be seen to back down in the face of the North's threats, while Kim Jong Un may feel that his successful missile and nuclear tests give him the ability to keep pressuring Seoul. The two may wind up talking themselves into conflict."
It also said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The North, which conducted its third underground nuclear test last month, had said recently that denuclearization of the region was impossible because of what it described as the United States' hostile policy toward it.
The U.N. resolution also outlines measures to step up scrutiny of suspicious sea shipments and air cargo and it expands restrictions to encompass several institutions and senior officials in the North's weapons industry, as well as a range of materials and technology known to be used in uranium enrichment.
