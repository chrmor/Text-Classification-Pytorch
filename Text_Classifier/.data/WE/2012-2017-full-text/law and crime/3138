Stoke City's Andrew Hall admits murdering girlfriend
An ex-Premier League academy footballer has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years for killing his girlfriend.
Andrew Hall, 18, released by Stoke City in May, pleaded guilty to murdering Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, at a house in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, on 9 June.
Miss Peat, of Westoning, suffered at least 60 stab wounds in the attack.
Judge Richard Foster, sentencing at Luton Crown Court, said Hall was jealous of her other friendships.
Hall, of Flitwick, admitted stabbing Miss Peat in the head and body at the house which belongs to a mutual friend.
She died from her injuries and severe blood loss after being treated by emergency services.
Hall, who suffered injuries to his hands, was at the end of a three-year scholarship at Stoke.
The court heard the midfield player was on the brink of signing as a professional with a future in the club's development side next season.
He had returned home to Robin Close, in Flitwick, and had spent the evening at nearby pubs with Ms Peat, a pupil at Harlington Upper School, in Harlington, near Dunstable.
Miss Peat was described as a caring girl who looked after her friends but also enjoyed her social life.
Luton Crown Court heard that she was subjected to an horrific attack.
Hall spent several days in hospital being treated for hand and arm wounds after the killing.
Judge Foster told Hall: "Megan Peat will never experience the thrill and success of exam results, going on to higher education, or perhaps being a bridesmaid at a best friend's wedding or an 18th birthday party.
"Her life ended in your hands at 15 years old.
"Only you know why you did what you did that night and what the catalyst was for such a ferocious attack.
"It is clear you were jealous of her innocent friendships with others."
Hall stabbed her 60 times in the head, neck and upper chest.
Two knives, including a serrated bread knife, were found next to her body.
Miss Peat's family said in a statement they were satisfied Andrew Hall had pleaded guilty.
The family said: "Megan was a healthy, vibrant, loving and caring person who was very much loved by all her family and all her many friends. She had her whole life ahead of her.
"Before her untimely death we were an ordinary family leading an ordinary life.
"Since that fateful day our world has changed beyond recognition.
"The pain of losing our beautiful daughter and the tragic and awful way she died will stay with us for the rest of our lives."
