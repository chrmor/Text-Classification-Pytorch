Three rockets hit area near Kuwait-Iraq border -TV
DUBAI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Three rockets have hit the border area between Kuwait and Iraq, Al Arabiya TV reported early on Friday quoting diplomatic sources.
The Dubai-based channel said the Katyusha rockets did not target Kuwaitâ€™s Mubarak Port which is under construction.
The port has been a subject of arguments between oil-producing Iraq and Kuwait, which share a small border.
Iraq says the port interferes with shipping lanes to its own ports. (Reporting by Martina Fuchs)
