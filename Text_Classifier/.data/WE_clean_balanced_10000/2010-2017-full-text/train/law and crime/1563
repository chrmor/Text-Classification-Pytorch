Halle Berry says stalker 'terrorized me and my family'
Actress Halle Berry on Tuesday was granted a restraining order against a convicted felon arrested on her Hollywood Hills property Monday.
Officers arrested Richard A. Franco, an unemployed Los Angeles man in his mid-20s who described himself as a community college student.
According to court papers, Franco jumped Berry's wall three times in recent days and put her in fear of her life.
Oscar-winner Berry secured an order forbidding Franco from being near her, her daughter or her home after giving a detailed account in a court declaration of the days running up to Franco’s arrest Monday evening.
“He has terrorized me and my family in three consecutive incidents over last three days,” Berry stated in a court filing that led to the order by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carol Goodson.
The incidents began Saturday. The actress was standing in her kitchen with her manager when she looked out to her gated backyard and was shocked to see a stranger approaching with something in his hand.
“She was in immediate fear as she saw him coming toward her and screamed 'There is a guy in my yard,' " according to a court filing.
Police from the threat management detail warned Berry’s staff that  Franco had a history of "violence, theft and drugs offenses."
Berry's filing concluded: “This person has invaded and trampled upon the most fundamental sense of security I have. … I am extremely frightened of him and what he might do to me and those I love.”
