Nightmare 28 Hour Flight Finally Arrives in San Francisco
SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) -- Passengers who spent more than a full day on board a stranded airliner are now telling horror stories about the experience after finally arriving at SFO.
The people who bought tickets for Etihad Airways Flight 183 from Abu Dhabi were stuck for 28 hours, including 12 hours on the tarmac in the Middle Eastern country.
"Although there was food on board, the crew did not feed the hungry, thirsty passengers and off loaded the meals," passenger Soofia Inayat wrote on Facebook. "There was no water and basic amenities like diapers, ice, snacks, clean drinking water."
Another passenger also took to Facebook to describe the experience.
"It took hours for the crew to give me hot water to make milk for my baby," Joythi Bachwani said. "While it is understood that there were weather-related problems, what I fail to understand is that while crew got replaced after few hours, the food, water and toilet supplies for passengers were not replaced properly."
The airline says it did the best it could considering the weather delays in Abu Dhabi.
"Etihad Airways apologizes to its passengers for the inconvenience that this major disruption has caused and thanks them for their patience during these extremely challenging few days," the company said in a written statement.
For some passengers in San Francisco, the mess still isn't over. Hundreds of passengers say the airline lost their luggage.
