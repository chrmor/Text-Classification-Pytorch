Thousands rally nationally against CSG
Thousands of protesters have staged rallies across the country condemning Australia's multibillion-dollar coal seam gas (CSG) industry.
They massed in NSW, Queensland and Western Australia today in what is believed to be the largest series of demonstrations against the controversial extraction technique ever.
In NSW alone there were 20 rallies, including one at Sydney's Martin Place where about 400 people heard claims that CSG mining could damage major water sources.
"In the Illawarra, they are drilling in special catchment areas ... these are areas that are so precious you and I are not allowed to go for a bushwalk there," Jacinta Green, from the anti CSG group Lock the Gate Alliance, told the rally.
"But the coal seam gas companies can take their trucks in, take their drills in, take their chemicals in and potentially contaminate our drinking water."
Ms Green outlined other major water sources, including the Hawkesbury River, to Sydney's north and the Warragamba Dam, south-west of the city, that Lock the Gate believes could be contaminated.
