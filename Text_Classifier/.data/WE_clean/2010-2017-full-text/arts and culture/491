Buggles to reform for one-off gig
New Wave band The Buggles are to reform for a one-off gig on 28 September, co-founder Trevor Horn has announced.
"The Buggles - along with some very special guest artists - will perform live on stage for one night only," a posting on his website reads.
The concert will see the original line-up perform debut album The Age of Plastic in full "at a special and intimate West London venue".
The group are best known for their 1979 number one Video Killed The Radio Star.
Two years later, it was the first song to be played on MTV when it began broadcasting in the US.
The Buggles only released two albums before their break-up in 1981, and they never toured.
Horn went on to become one of the UK's most influential pop producers, recording with Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Pet Shop Boys and Seal.
Proceeds from the September show will go to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in London.
