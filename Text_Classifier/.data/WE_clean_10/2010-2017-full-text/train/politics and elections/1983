Australia in political limbo after voters punish PM
Australia was in political limbo Sunday after voters punished Prime Minister Julia Gillard for deposing her predecessor two months ago, leaving the nation facing its first hung parliament in 70 years.
Australia's first woman prime minister and opposition leader Tony Abbott were both scrambling to broker deals to form a fragile coalition government after Australians Saturday stripped Gillard of her right to rule alone.
Gillard and Abbott raced to woo independent and Greens "kingmakers" to join a coalition government and break deadlock in parliament.
Up to four independents and a new Greens MP looked set to hold the balance of power.
"I've had two very kind phone calls -- one from the prime minister early in the evening just to congratulate me and then about 1:15 am the leader of the opposition rang to congratulate me as well," said independent Tony Windsor.
"Obviously we did mention if there was a hung parliament that there may have to be some discussion," he told reporters, declining however to say which party he would throw his support behind.
