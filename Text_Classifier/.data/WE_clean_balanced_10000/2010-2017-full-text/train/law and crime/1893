Seton Hall campus reopens after bomb hoax
Seton Hall University was evacuated Thursday afternoon after someone claimed that bombs had been placed in several campus buildings.
No explosives were found, and the South Orange, N.J., campus was reopened about 8 p.m. ET, campus police said.
Essex County Sheriff Armando Fontoura said the threat, which claimed bombs had been placed in every building, came in about 3:30 p.m. and was posted on Facebook, the Newark Star-Ledger reported. South Orange police reported the anonymous threat was received at 3:05 p.m.
City and Seton Hall police closed the main campus as a precaution as officers and the Essex County sheriff's bomb squad conducted a full sweep of all 15 buildings. Evening classes were canceled.
Only two buildings were occupied when the threat was received, Fontoura said, and both were given the all-clear about 5:30 p.m. The Cabrini residence hall was re-opened about 6 p.m. and students were being allowed back on campus, the Star-Ledger said.
About 100 students and staff were on campus at the time. Summer classes began last week.
The private Catholic school was founded in 1856. Current enrollment includes about 5,200 undergraduates and 4,400 graduate students. The university, about 15 miles from New York City, is home to the Stillman School of Business and the John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations.
In January 2000, an arson fire killed three students and injured 54 others in Boland Hall, a freshman dormitory.
