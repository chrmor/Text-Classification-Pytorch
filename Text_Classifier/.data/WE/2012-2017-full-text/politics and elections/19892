James O’Keefe releases another Project Veritas video claiming Hillary Clinton campaign is “bird dogging”
Conservative video-maker James O'Keefe's — best known for selectively editing undercover footage to get people fired — claimed another victim on Monday, after his Project Veritas group released the first in what he says will be a series of undercover videos revealing corruption within Hillary Clinton's campaign.
In several surreptitiously recorded video conversations, Scott Foval, the former national field director at Americans United for Change, admits to "bird dogging" — planting agitators at — Donald Trump's rallies to draw negative media attention.
Foval describes colluding with Bob Creamer, co-founder of consulting group Democracy Partners, to "put people in the line, at the front . . . to get in front at the rally, so that when Trump comes down the rope line, they’re the ones asking him the question in front of the reporter, because they’re pre-placed there."
"To funnel that kind of operation, you have to start back with people two weeks ahead of time and train them how to ask questions," Foval explains. "You have to train them to bird dog."
Among Foval's trainees, he says, are "mentally ill people, that we pay to do shit."
"Over the last 20 years, I’ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff, and I’ve also taken them for dinner, and I’ve also made sure they had a hotel, and a shower.  And I put them in a program," he brags. "Like, I’ve done that."
Americans United for Change subsequently cut ties with Foval, according to a statement from the group's head, Brad Woodhouse.
