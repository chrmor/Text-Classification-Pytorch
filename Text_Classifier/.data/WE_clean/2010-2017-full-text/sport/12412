U.S. stunned as Europe wins Ryder Cup
Olazabal's players struggled to keep up with the U.S. in the fourballs and the foursomes, but they raced out of the traps from the very first tee shot of the singles matches.
Led by Luke Donald, who comprehensively saw off Bubba Watson in the opening game, Europe rode on the crest of a wave with Englishman Ian Poulter, who won four of his matches, at the center of the charge.
"And last night in that team room was buzzing. We weren't four down. We were all square. We just knew we had a chance and do you know what? This is history right here. This has been unbelievable.
"I'm going to enjoy it, with the best team I've ever seen, and the best captain I've ever seen, and everyone else, because this right here is special."
Germany's Kaymer took a one-shot lead on the 17th and then produced the defining moment of the 39th Ryder Cup -- holing the crucial putt on the last to defeat Steve Stricker and ensure the U.S. could not reach the winning target of 14 1/2 points.
"They played very, very well," said U.S. captain Love III. "They holed putts when they had to. We never got that big chip in or that big shot, maybe it just wasn't our week.
"The Europeans played with class and I congratulate them. We never took this for granted. We had a lot of guys who got beat today, I don't know if they played badly but they didn't win.
"There's probably a lot I'd change now we didn't win. It'll be disappointing when we think about how well we played and didn't win. It's not good for us, but it's good for golf this Ryder Cup."
