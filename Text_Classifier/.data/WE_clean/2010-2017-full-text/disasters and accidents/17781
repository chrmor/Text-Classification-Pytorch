US company DigiGlobe Inc crowdsources search for missing flight MH370
A CROWDSOURCING effort to locate the missing Malaysia Airlines plane using satellite imagery has overloaded the developer's network with an "unprecedented" amount of traffic.
US satellite imaging company DigitalGlobe Inc has launched a platform allowing volunteers to search online through more than 3000 square km of the area where MH370 may have crashed.
Users zoom in on each satellite image and tag anything that they believe could be wreckage.
An algorithm will find where there is overlap in the tags - where multiple people have found something of note. The tags will then be analysed by experts and shared with authorities.
"For people who aren't able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who can't fly aeroplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out," DigitalGlobe's Luke Barrington told US news network ABC News.
"We'll say 'here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations'.
"Is it really an aircraft wing that's been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 per cent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I'd start."
The campaign has proven so popular that users crashed the system earlier today.
"We are working to best handle an unprecedented level of web traffic and interest in supporting the search," DigitalGlobe said in a statement.
"Please check back soon. We have new imagery collections planned for today and hope to make those images available online for the crowd as soon as possible."

CNN reportsthat one volunteer, Mike Seberger, 43, found a silhouette in the ocean similar to the scale of a Boeing 777-200, the same model of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, soon after the site launched on Sunday.
His discovery can be seen on his CNN iReport page, which is also a form of crowdsourcing used by CNN.
News_Image_File: Mike Seberger found what looked suspiciously like a silhoutette of a Boeing 777 using DigitalGlobe's crowdsourcing Tomnod site.
"At first, I skipped past it, thinking, 'Nah. No way I would find anything that quickly,' " Mr Seberger said. "But then I kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself, 'It does resemble a plane ...'
"I played with the zoom on my browser a bit, and took a screenshot at 200 percent, which is what I uploaded" to CNN iReport," the Chicago-based IT manager said.
"Looking at it objectively, the shape of 'my' object appears plane-like and the dimensions are consistent with a 777-200. That said, I feel it is more likely to be a boat."
