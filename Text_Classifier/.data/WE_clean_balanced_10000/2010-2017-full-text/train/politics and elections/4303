Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete has won a second term in office, despite allegations of vote rigging.
Tanzania's electoral commission has declared Mr Kikwete the winner of last weekend's election with almost two thirds of the vote.
However, his re-election is dogged by claims from opposition parties of electoral fraud.
Foreign observers have reported evidence of vote rigging in some districts.
Mr Kikwete's win comes despite frustration among many Tanzanians over his failure to combat corruption and poverty.
Foreign donors have also expressed concern about the slow pace of reform within the country.
Mr Kikwete has one more five-year term to try to appease his critics.
