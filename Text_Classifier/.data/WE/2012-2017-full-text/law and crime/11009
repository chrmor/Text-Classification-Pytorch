Chief of Juarez drug cartel captured, Mexican officials say
The younger Carrillo Fuentes, known as "The Viceroy," was the surviving leader of the Juarez cartel. Though the organization had lost power in its namesake city, which once topped the list of deadly places in Mexico, security experts said he continued to control massive transport of marijuana and heroin to the United States.
