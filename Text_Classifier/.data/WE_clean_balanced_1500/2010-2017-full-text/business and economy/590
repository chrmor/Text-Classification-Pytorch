Oil leaps 9% as OPEC agrees to cut output: Live blog recap
The OPEC meeting in Vienna that traders and analysts have keenly been discussing, fretting over and awaiting for months is finally kicking off this morning. 
The issue is simple: Will the 14 cartel members agree on measures to freeze or cut oil production in a bid to stabilize the struggling market? 
The organization in late September agreed on an accord to target production between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels a day, effectively pointing to a production cut from current levels around 33.83 million barrels a day in October. The finals details and implementation plans are what’s supposed to be hashed out today. 
The process to get there, however, is not as simple. While there seems to be broad consensus that some action is needed, a potential deal is being hobbled by political issues and disputes over country quotas.

Iran, for example, insists it won’t curb production as it ramps up supply following years of sanctions from the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia stands firm that there won’t be any output plan without Tehran playing a meaningful role.
In early Wednesday trade, crude oil prices were up 1.7% at $46 a barrel, while Brent was up 2% at $47.29 a barrel.
