Micheal Martin to replace Brian Cowen as Fianna Fail leader
The 50-year-old was elected just over a week after he launched a failed leadership challenge against Mr Cowen and stood down as Ireland's foreign minister, a move that helped to fatally destabilise the premier.
"Micheal Martin T.D. (MP) has been elected as the 8th leader of Fianna Fail," the party said in a Twitter message, following a secret ballot.
A reserved figure, Mr Martin is a stark contrast to the populist Mr Cowen and he will have little time to prove himself ahead of elections expected to be held in February or March.
The centrist Fianna Fail is braced for a hammering from voters angry about its handling of the economic crisis which led to a 67.5-billion-euro International Monetary Fund and European Union bail-out.
Mr Martin beat off competition from Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, Social Protection Minister Eamon O Cuiv and Sports Minister Mary Hanafin, although he was the favourite to win.
The leadership vote was held after Mr Cowen stepped down on Saturday, in a shock move that followed a week of political turmoil sparked by Mr Martin's challenge.
Just hours later, the Green party pulled out of the Fianna Fail-led coalition government, depriving Mr Cowen – who had vowed to stay in office as prime minister – of his parliamentary majority.
Immediately after the vote on Wednesday, Fianna Fail lawmakers returned to a parliamentary debate about a finance bill containing austerity measures needed for the bail-out.
Mr Cowen's crumbling government has agreed with opposition parties to fast-track the bill and get it approved by Saturday, at which point parliament will be dissolved and a general election called.
Mr Cowen had last week set the general election for March 11 but was forced to bring it forward. The opposition Labour party said on Monday the vote would be held on February 25, although this has yet to be confirmed by the government.
