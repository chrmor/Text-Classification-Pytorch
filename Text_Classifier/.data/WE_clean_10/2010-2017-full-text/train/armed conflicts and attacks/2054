Iraq: Baghdad market bombings kill at least 23
Islamic State (IS) militants say they were behind two suicide bombs in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, that killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 60.
The attacks targeted police checkpoints in the Wathba and Haraj markets during morning rush-hour, police said.
The bombers were said to have been on foot and wearing explosives vests.
The Reuters news agency said four people were killed in a third blast in the nearby Bab al-Muadham district, but it is unclear who was behind it.
Fighters from the IS group have carried out numerous suicide bombings and other attacks against civilian and government targets in and around Baghdad.
Government forces and allied mainly Shia militia have been fighting IS since the group took over large parts of the country last year.
