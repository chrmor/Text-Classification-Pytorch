Peggy Whitson breaks the record for the longest time in space by a US astronaut
Peggy Whitson has broken Jeff Williams' record for the longest amount of time in space by a US astronaut.
Currently serving an extended stay aboard the International Space Station , Whitson passed Williams' number of 534 days, 2 hours and 48 minutes of cumulative time in space at 1.27am (ET) on April 24, claiming yet another record.
She is already the first female astronaut to command the space station , and also holds the record for the most amount of spacewalks by a female.
When she does finally return to Earth, she will have spent over 650 days in space.

Beginning her career in the 1980s, Whitson has a doctorate in biochemistry and served as deputy division chief of the Medical Sciences Division at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. She was officially selected as an astronaut in 1996.
"She made her first trip to the International Space Station in 2002," said Mark Garcia from NASA.
"Space shuttle Endeavour delivered her and her Expedition 5 crewmates for a 184-day stay in the four modules that made up the space station at the time. While there, she took part in 21 science investigations and became the first NASA science officer.
"In 2008, Whitson returned as commander of Expedition 16, and was on hand for the installation of the Harmony node, the Columbus laboratory and the Kibo logistics module. She spent another 192 days in space and performed her first five spacewalks."
Since being aboard the ISS this time around, she has added another three spacewalks and is due to perform another one on May 12.
In total, she will have spent more than 53 hours outside the station in the vacuum of space.
