Gaza terrorist killed, 4 wounded
Sources in Gaza said a Palestinian gunman was killed and four others were injured Tuesday afternoon from IDF artillery fire near the security fence, east of the Zeitoun neighborhood in north Gaza City.
According to the report, the artillery fire was directed at a terror cell belonging to the radical Salafi faction, which is linked to al-Qaeda. Two of the terrorists injured in the incident are said to be in light to moderate condition. The condition of the other two remains unclear. 
The IDF confirmed it had attacked a group of terrorists who fired an RPG at soldiers operating in north Gaza, near the Karni border crossing.
"Following the launching of an anti-tank missile at an IDF force, the army returned fire and identified a hit. There were no causalities among the soldiers," the IDF Spokesperson's Office said.
The past few days have seen an increase in Qassam rocket attacks and border incidents. The escalation in violence is part of the militant organizations' efforts to hinder the recently launched peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
On Sunday three Palestinians were killed when IDF soldiers clashed with gunmen in north Gaza. Among the casualties were an elderly shepherd and his grandson. According to the Palestinians, the Israelis fired artillery at gunmen approaching the security fence, but one shell hit a Palestinian home. There were no injuries among the soldiers.
A number of Qassams and mortar shells were fired at Israel since the Jewish New Year, but there were no reports of injury or damage.
Earlier this week, Shin Bet Director Yuval Diskin warned that terror groups may step up their activity against Israel as long as the peace talks progress.
