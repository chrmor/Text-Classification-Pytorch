Gay pride march in Serbia takes place amid violence
At least 110 people, most of them police, were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at Serbia's gay pride march in Belgrade on Sunday.
Hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks, flares, bottles and Molotov cocktails. Most of the injured were taken to hospital, trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police.
More than 5,000 officers, backed up by police helicopters, sealed off the central streets in the Serbian capital for the march. Rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations, setting parked cars on fire, overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs.
Rioters also trashed the entrance to the Serbian state television building RTS and the seats of Socialist Party leader Ivica Dacic and the ruling Democratic Party, setting one part of the latter building on fire.
