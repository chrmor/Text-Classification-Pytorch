Great Britain draw Croatia away in the Davis Cup after Russia heroics
Andy Murray says he will be available for tie GB's first away tie in eight rounds
Great Britain have been drawn away to Croatia in the Davis Cup World Group play-offs in September.
Leon Smith's side set up the opportunity to return to the top level of the competition for the first time since 2008 with a brilliant 3-2 victory over Russia in Coventry last weekend.
Today's draw ends a run of seven consecutive ties at home – this will be Smith's first away tie – but, with Andy Murray having pledged to make himself available, it is one they will be confident of winning.
