Atlanta teenager shot in neck at Price Middle School
A 14-year-old has been taken to hospital after being shot in the back of the neck outside a school in Atlanta, Georgia, say police.
The teenager is alert, conscious and breathing, and all other pupils are safe.
A teacher suffered minor cuts and bruises in the incident at Price Middle School, said Atlanta Fire Captain Marian McDaniel.
A suspect, thought to be a student, has been taken into custody.
Aerial news footage showed a number of police at the scene.
Children at the school had been taken into an auditorium for their safety after the shooting at 13:50 local time (18:50 GMT). They were being released to their parents around 17:00 local time.
Authorities said an armed officer at the school was able to disarm the gunman moments after the incident occurred.
There are metal detectors at the school, according to Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis. It is not known how the gunman brought the weapon on to the premises.
Police say they believe the attack was not random.
Thursday's shooting comes the day after a closely watched Senate hearing on gun control.
A mass shooting at a primary school in Connecticut that saw 27 people, including children, killed has revived debate over whether to tighten the nation's gun laws.
