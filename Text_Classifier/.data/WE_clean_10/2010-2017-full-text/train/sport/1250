Royals Rally Past Mets for First World Series Title Since 1985
At the end of each baseball season, Ned Yost goes home to his 700-acre spread in Georgia, where he can close the gate behind him, settle into his blind and hunt. It is his sanctuary, a place where he is at peace, jettisoning the scrutiny and sleepless nights that accompany him during the season.
Yost expected it to be the same last winter, after the team he manages, the Kansas City Royals, came agonizingly close to winning the World Series, the seventh game ending when catcher Salvador Perez fouled out with the tying run at third base.
One day turned into one week, then one month, but the sting did not abate.
When Yost returned to Arizona for spring training, the disappointment still felt like a kick in the gut. For his players, it served as a spur.
“We think about it quite often,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again: I think that’s kind of something that we all turn to mentally, to kind of — when there’s points in time during the season where your team is not going too well. You look in September there, and we started to slide a little bit. But I just think everyone kind of relates back to that and relates to how much that hurt.”
