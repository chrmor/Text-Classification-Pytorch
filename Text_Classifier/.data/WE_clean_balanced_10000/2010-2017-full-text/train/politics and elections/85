Tonga set for landmark vote
Tonga will vote for its first popularly elected parliament on Thursday, marking the impoverished Pacific nation's often uneasy transition from monarchy to fledgling democracy.
For the first time, the majority of Tonga's politicians will be elected by the people rather than appointed by King George Tupou V, whose ancestors united the 170-island archipelago in 1845.
"It's certainly a turning point in history in many respects," said Pacific historian Ian Campbell, a visiting research professor at Japan's Kagoshima University.
"Whether it results in different policies is very difficult to tell."
The move towards democracy follows riots in the capital Nuku'alofa in November 2006, when youths took to the streets to protest the slow pace of political reform, killing eight people and burning swathes of the city centre.
Since then, the nation dubbed "the Friendly Isles" by British explorer Captain James Cook has remained peaceful, and police chief Chris Kelley said he was not expecting any trouble during Thursday's vote.
