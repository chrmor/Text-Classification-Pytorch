'Nearly 15,000 children killed' in Syria civil war
DAMASCUS - A total of 14,629 children were killed in Syrian regime attacks against opposition forces since March 2011, according to a London-based rights group.
 The Syrian Network for Human Rights said Thursday 2.1 million Syrian children suffer lack of food and health issues, while 1.1 million children live as refugees in neighboring countries.
According to the group, at least 35,000 children have been born as refugees due to the three-year conflict in the war-torn country.
Since the conflict erupted, 3.5 million children have had to leave school.
In August last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency announced one million Syrian children were registered as refugees in neighboring countries, raising fears of a 'lost generation' in Syria.
The civil war, which emerged out of a popular uprising against the rule of President Bashar Assad in March 2011, has internally displaced 6.4 million people, and forced 2.5 million out of their country.
The vast majority of the Syrian shelter-seekers have fled to Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.
