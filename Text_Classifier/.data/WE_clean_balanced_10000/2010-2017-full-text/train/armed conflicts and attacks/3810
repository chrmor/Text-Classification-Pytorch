Afghan soldier 'kills Nato colleague' at Kandahar airport
An Afghan soldier has opened fire at Kandahar international airport, killing a Slovakian Nato soldier and woundng six others, officials say.
They say that the soldier fired from a security tower before being overpowered and detained.
The casualties are all from Slovakia, officials in Bratislava confirmed. Nato gave no details. Thousands of Nato and Afghan troops are based at the airport.
More than 100 Nato soldiers have been killed in "insider attacks" since 2007.
Afghan officials told the BBC that the soldier who opened fire was now in Afghan National Army (ANA) custody.
Slovakian Defence Minister Martin Glvac told a press conference on Tuesday that the soldier was Slovakia's first fatality in Afghanistan.
He said that two of the soldiers suffered serious wounds while four more were lightly hurt.
The BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says such attacks have become one of the defining features of the latter phase of the conflict in Afghanistan and have undermined Nato's ambition to fight "shoulder to shoulder" with Afghans against the Taliban.
The pressure on contributing nations to withdraw their troops by the end of 2014 has been exacerbated by such "green-on-blue" attacks.
Many more Afghan security force members have died at the hands of their colleagues, but correspondents say reliable figures for so-called "green-on-green" attacks are hard to come by.
