Toddler among 14 hurt after Toronto buses crash
A toddler in a stroller and a bus driver were among 14 people who were injured after two TTC buses collided head-on at a ramp at Wilson subway station in northwest Toronto.
The crash occurred just after 11:17 a.m. ET on a lower level two-way ramp at the station open exclusively to buses, said Toronto police Const. Tony Vella.
The 14 who were hurt were all taken to hospital, according to police. They suffered largely minor injuries, including bruising, bumps, cuts, and facial lacerations.
It appears the buses collided with each other head-on on the drivers' side, said the CBC's Lucy Lopez, reporting from the scene. Police at the scene said the collision may have occurred after the bus driving westbound on the ramp crossed the centre line as the eastbound bus approached.
The TTC will investigate the incident internally.
Three ambulances and at least five police cruisers were at the scene. TTC subway service was not significantly affected.
