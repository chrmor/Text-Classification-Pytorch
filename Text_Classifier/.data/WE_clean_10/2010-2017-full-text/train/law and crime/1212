Trump calls on Venezuela to release jailed opposition leader Lopez
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Venezuela to release opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who was sentenced last year to nearly 14 years in prison on charges of inciting anti-government protests in 2014.
“Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori (just met w/ @marcorubio) out of prison immediately,” Trump said in a Twitter post.
Trump held a White House meeting with Lopez’s wife, Lilian Tintori, and Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday.
