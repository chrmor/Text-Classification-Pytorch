Just after 5:30 PM ET today, President Obama sat down for a discussion with a group of Americans from across the country in a Google+ Hangout. It was the first online conversation to happen at the White House in real time -- ever.
Even before the event, more than 227,000 people had taken time to participate -- submitting questions for the President to answer or voting for their favorite.
