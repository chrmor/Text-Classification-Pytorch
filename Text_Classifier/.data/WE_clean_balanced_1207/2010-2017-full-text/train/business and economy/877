Avian flu outbreak leads to ban on poultry imports
The poultry industry says parts of Asia have overreacted by banning Australian exports over an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria.
Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and Hong Kong have banned imports of poultry from Victoria, while Japan has suspended imports from all parts of Australia.
About 24,000 free range ducks on farms at New Gisborne and Mickleham, north-west of Melbourne were destroyed after testing positive to a low pathogenic strain of the virus.
The head of the Australian Chicken Foundation, Andreas Dubs, says the action by Japan is unnecessary
"It is often the case that a country might over-react a little at the first news," he said.
"I think that might be the case with Japan, that the initial reaction is to stop everything and hopefully, in due course, a few days, those limitations might be lifted."
The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry says it is keeping trading partners informed of how the outbreak is being managed.
Victorian Deputy Premier, Peter Ryan, says he does not think the outbreak will have long term effects for the state's poultry industry.
"We have a very strong place in these markets both domestically and particularly internationally," he said.
"Our quality control is recognised world-wide as being the best, certainly amongst the best.
"These issues do arise intermittently and I'm sure it will be accommodated sooner than later and we'll be back in the market."
