Government commission approves bill on assisting deceased judges' families
MOSCOW, February 26 - RAPSI. The Russian government's legislative commission has approved a bill on providing social assistance to unemployable family members of deceased judges.
The bill was drafted to stipulate a special procedure for paying allowances to unemployable family members of judges who did not die from a work-related cause.
According to the document, the size of such allowances will depend on whether or not the judge died from a work-related cause, on the salary or pension, the length of service as a judge, and the number of dependents of the given judge.
The commission has decided that the bill's adoption will ensure proper social security for unemployable family members of deceased judges. The bill will next be discussed at a government meeting.
