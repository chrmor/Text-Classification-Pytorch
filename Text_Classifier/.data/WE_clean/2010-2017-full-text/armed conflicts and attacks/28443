Strikes kill up to 200 Kurdish militants in Syria
Up to 200 militia members were killed in air strikes in Aleppo province in Syria where Kurdish-led forces have been advancing against Islamic State militants, Turkish media reported Thursday.
The Turkish General Staff said between 160 and 200 members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and its affiliate, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), died in the bombings, according to the semi-official Anadolu news agency.
However, Commander Mahmoud Barkhadan of the People’s Protection Unit — the main Syrian Kurdish militia — told the Associated Press that early reports suggested that no more than 10 fighters were killed and 20 wounded.
The Turkish military did not give a location but the group is trying to take the key city of Al-Bab, located about 23 miles northeast of Aleppo, as the Islamic State withdraws. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States.
