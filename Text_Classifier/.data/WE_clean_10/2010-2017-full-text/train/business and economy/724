Results of Britainâ€™s Brexit Referendum
Welcome to our TOPLive blog. We'll be bringing you the outcome of the U.K.'s EU membership referendum, starting at 9:55 p.m. London time on Thursday, June 23. The last votes are cast at 10 p.m., with counting starting immediately up and down the country and the first results being announced within a few hours.The stakes couldn't be higher -- will Britain become the first country ever to quit the EU, possibly precipitating the break-up of the bloc -- and another Scottish independence referendum? Could Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne survive a ``Leave' ' vote? Will a decision to stay in scupper Boris Johnson's chances of becoming prime minister? And how will the markets react?
