Suicide bomber targeting police kills 4 people in northwest Pakistan
Pakistani authorities say a suicide bomber targeting policemen has killed four people in the main northwestern city of Peshawar.
Liaqat Ali Khan, the city's police chief, says the attack aimed at one of his partol teams on Monday also wounded over 30 people. The bomber detonated his explosives as the patrol passed by.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban. The group has been waging a bloody insurgency against the government for years and has stepped up attacks ahead of the May 11 parliamentary election.
On Sunday, the Taliban killed 11 people in bomb attacks on a political rally and two campaign offices in the northwest. The group is seeking to disrupt the election.
