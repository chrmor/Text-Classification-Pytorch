Hermine: Florida braces for first hurricane in more than a decade
Hurricane Hermine has swept onto Florida's Gulf coast with winds and heavy rain causing flooding and cutting power to tens of thousands of people, as officials warn of "life-threatening" conditions.
The Category One storm made landfall on Friday morning local time near St Marks, just south of Florida's capital Tallahassee, with 130 kilometre per hour winds extending 72 kilometres from the hurricane's eye, the Miami-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
"There is a danger of life-threatening inundation within the next 12 to 24 hours along the Gulf coast of Florida," it added.
The storm is moving north-northeast at 23kph.
Some 70,000 people in rain-drenched Tallahassee were already without power as local television stations broadcast video footage of buffeting winds and cars driving through flooded streets.
Authorities in several counties have issued mandatory evacuation orders for residents living on the coast and in low-lying regions.
"This is life-threatening," Governor Rick Scott said on Thursday, urging residents to take warnings seriously.
Hundreds of schools and government offices will be closed on Friday as residents brace for the storm's full impact.
Hermine is the first hurricane to hit Florida in 11 years since Hurricane Wilma in 2005.
Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said 100 Florida National Guard personnel were activated, with 6,000 more on alert in the state and 34,000 members ready to deploy from elsewhere in the United States.
President Barack Obama has asked FEMA administrator Craig Fugate to keep him updated on the situation "and to alert him if there are any significant unmet needs", White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
"Local, state and federal officials have been working diligently to prepare for these storms and have resources on hand to respond to them as necessary," he added.
