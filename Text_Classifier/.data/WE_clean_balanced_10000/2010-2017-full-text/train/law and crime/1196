Crimea's Russia-Backed Court Issues Arrest Warrant For Tatar Leader
A court in Russia-annexed Crimea has issued an arrest warrant for the veteran leader of Crimean Tatars, Mustafa Dzhemilev.
The Kyiv District Court in Simferopol issued the warrant on January 21 and added Dzhemilev on its wanted list, saying three investigations had been launched into his activities.
Details about the charges were not made public.
In April 2014, just weeks after Russian annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, Russian authorities barred Dzhemilev from entering the region for five years.
Dzhemilev, a Ukrainian lawmaker, and other Crimean Tatar activists have said that Crimeaâ€™s indigenous Tatar population will never recognize the peninsula's annexation by Moscow.
The 72-year-old Dzhemilev is a well-known Soviet-era human rights activist who served six sentences in Soviet prison camps from 1966 to 1986.
