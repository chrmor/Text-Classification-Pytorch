Narathiwat man held over Erawan bomb
A Thai Muslim man in Narathiwat has been detained for questioning on suspicion of being involved in the Erawan Shrine bombing and has been sent to Bangkok for questioning, reports said.
Kamarudeng Saho, 38, of Moo 5 village in tambon Pasemat of Sungai Kolok district, was detained by a government security unit at his house in Sungai Kolok on Tuesday.
He was flown by helicopter to Bangkok and detained at the 11th Army Circle headquarters on Wednesday afternoon.
The report on his detention confirmed a remark made by Pol Lt Gen Prawut Thawornsiri, the police spokesman, on Wednesday that another bomb suspect had been picked up by the Narathiwat Task Force 36.
Pol Lt Gen Prawut said police investigators found the man had contacted wanted suspect Wanna Suansan, also known by her Muslim name Maisaroh, by phone.
Ms Wanna has been, until  now, the only Thai suspect in the bombings. Arrest warrants have been issued for her and her Turkish husband Emrah Davutoglu. Both were believed to be in Turkey.
