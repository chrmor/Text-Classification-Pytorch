Egg thrower: 'I didn't lose my temper'
A shareholder who threw an egg at executives of the Bank of Ireland at an annual general meeting (AGM) in Dublin, has said that he did not "lose his temper".
Shareholder Gary Keogh from Blackrock, Co Dublin said he had waited since the morning to throw the missile at Pat Molloy and Richie Boucher.
Mr Keogh was escorted from the meeting by security. He also threw eggs at an AGM in 2009.
