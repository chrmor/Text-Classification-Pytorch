‘Hamilton’ wins 11 Tony Awards, missing record but making Broadway history
When it comes to overdue veterans, though, the Oscar-winning Lange may have nothing on "The Humans" stars Reed Birney and Jayne Houdyshell. Each won their first Tony, featured acting prizes, after long careers that often took them far from the Broadway stage. "I've been an actor for 42 years. Thirty-five of them were pretty bad," Birney said. "The last eight have been great." Houdyshell could be seen at a swank party later that night—it included Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Andrew Lloyd Webber and nearly every other three-named person of note—basking in the congratulations of well-wishers, a reminder that Broadway is often a collision of the glamorous and the lunchbucket.
