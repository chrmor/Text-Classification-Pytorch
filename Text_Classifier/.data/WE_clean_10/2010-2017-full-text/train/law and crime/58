Supreme Court Tie Dooms Obama Immigration Policy
There have been more than 2 million deportations in Obama's tenure.
The president on Thursday stressed that people who have been in the country for a long time and are otherwise law abiding will remain lower deportation priorities.
He added that the tie was "heartbreaking" for millions of immigrants.
Of those who opposed his executive actions, the president said: “I guarantee you at some point, every one of us has somebody in our background who people didn't want coming here."
However, the tie "takes us further from the country we aspire to be," Obama added.
And ultimately, the president said, the nation has a choice to make.
"We’re going to have to make a decision about whether we are a people who tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where the workers who pick our fruit or make our beds never have the chance to get right with the law — or whether we’re going to give them a chance, just like our forebears had a chance, to take responsibility and give their kids a better future," he said.

The death of Justice Antonin Scalia left the Supreme Court evenly divided on the issue. Thursday's tie vote means the justices were unable to announce a ruling, an outcome that leaves in place the lower court rulings against enforcing the plan.
The lack of a decision by the Supreme Court, Obama said, is a direct result of Congress failing to confirm his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, to the bench.
Under the proposal, adults in the United States illegally could remain if they meet certain residency requirements and have children who are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. It would also expand another program, now in effect, that allows young people to stay in the country if they were brought here under age 16.
