China must up its game against cyber crime: Experts
Security experts said China should establish a cross-ministry identity-management system in order to better protect privacy and fight high-technology crimes.Wu Jing, an analyst from the China Academy of Telecommunication Research under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told China Daily that the country needs to merge the current systems, which are run by different ministries, in order to better crack down on issues such as online fraud and hackers."People in China now have to submit their information to different government agencies, telecom carriers and Internet service providers, which creates heavy duplication, and makes it hard to track high-technology crimes," said Wu.She said a unified system will also help to prevent private information from being leaked.Chinese government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, currently operate different identity-management systems that are unable to share information.The systems run by telecom carriers and Internet service providers are also isolated and forbid the sharing of information.
