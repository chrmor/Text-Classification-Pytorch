Ash cloud prevents NZ flights
The plume of volcanic ash will prevent any Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin services flying to New Zealand today.
The airlines say the services will again be suspended due to the ash from Chile's Puyehue volcano.
However Air New Zealand has been flying, as it says its planes fly around and under the cloud.
Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin say a decision on tomorrow's flights will be made some time today.
Australian domestic and other international services are operating to schedule.
In South America, flights to and from Buenos Aires are resuming normal schedule after being grounded by the ash cloud, although delays are still being felt in neighbouring Uruguay.
