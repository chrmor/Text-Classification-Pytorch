French election: Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron lock horns in TV debate – as it happened
Tonight’s debate is not going to go down as a classic. Previous TV encounters on the way to winning the French Presidency have delivered lines that have lived long in the memory: “You do not have a monopoly on heart” for example. This evening was a lot more of an unseemly squabble, and at times very ugly.
All the signs from the polls are that Macron will win at the weekend, but it looks like a sizeable chunk of Mélenchon supporters will not be helping him on his way. Could that make a difference and let Le Pen in?
We’ll find out on Sunday night. Join us then.
