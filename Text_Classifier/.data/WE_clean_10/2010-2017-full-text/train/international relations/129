No progress in Assange talks
London - Talks between the foreign ministers of Britain and Ecuador ended with no breakthrough over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who remains in the South American country's London embassy, the Foreign Office said on Monday. But Foreign Secretary William Hague and his Ecuadorian counterpart, Ricardo Patino agreed to establish a working group to solve the year-long standoff. "The two ministers held a bilateral meeting this [Monday] morning for 45 minutes," the Foreign Office said in a statement. "Ministers agreed that officials should establish a working group to find a diplomatic solution to the issue of Julian Assange, but no substantive progress was made." Assange fled to the embassy nearly a year ago to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault and rape, which he denies.
