Barisan Nasional maintains two-thirds majority in Sarawak state election
Malaysia's ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) has retained its hold on the state of Sarawak, winning 72 out of 82 seats in the election on Saturday (May 7).
SARAWAK, Malaysia: Malaysia's ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) maintained its two-thirds majority in the state of Sarawak, winning 72 out of 82 seats at the 11th state election on Saturday (May 7).
Mr Adenan Satem, whom analysts had predicted would help BN win the state again, was also sworn in as Chief Minister at the Astana in Kuching on Saturday night.
Opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) secured seven and three seats respectively, according to the Election Commission.
In a post-election press conference, Prime Minister Najib Razak said the results reflect the people's confidence in reinstated Chief Minister Adenan, as well as in the partnership between the federal and Sarawak governments.
The polls were BN's first electoral test since controversy erupted around troubled state investment firm 1MDB and corruption accusations came to light about Mr Najib, who has not been found guilty of any crime by Malaysian authorities.
These were also the first polls contested by the new opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan, after the previous Pakatan Rakyat fell apart due to in-fighting.
