Tropical Storm Maria could become a hurricane before hitting Bermuda
Tropical Storm Maria advisory from the National HurricaneCenter says Maria is strengthening. A hurricane watch has been issued for Bermuda.
At 7 p.m. , the center of Tropical Storm Maria was located near latitude 27.2 north, longitude 68.9 west. Maria is moving toward the north-northeast near 17 mph. A continued north-northeastward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Maria will pass west of Bermuda on Thursday morning. A turn toward the northeast and an additional increase in forward speed is anticipated on Friday.
Reports from an Air Force hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph, with higher gusts. Some strengthening is possible during the next 12 to 24 hours, and Maria could become a hurricane on Thursday. A weakening trend is likely to begin by Friday.
Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles, mainly to the east of the center.
The minimum central pressure estimated from aircraft observations is 999 mb, 29.50 inches.
Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches can be expected across Bermuda through Thursday morning.
Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by late tonight or early Thursday, with hurricane conditions possible.
