The UAE has announced compulsory military service for all males between the ages of 18 and 30.
The move was announced by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, on Twitter.
Sheikh Mohammed said that the country’s cabinet had endorsed the plan, although there is no indication when the rules will take effect.
The length of service is set to be two years for those without high school degrees, and nine months for those who have graduated from high school.
Military service will be optional for women.
“A reserve force for the UAE will be made up of those who have completed their national service, as well as members of the military who have finished their service in the armed forces,” Sheikh Mohammed said.
In November, Qatar announced that All Qatari men aged between 18 and 35 will soon be forced to undertake up to four months compulsory military service if a new government draft law is given the green light by authorities, according to a report by the AFP news agency.
The new legislation will require four months compulsory service for all men within the age bracket, while university graduates will only be expected to serve three months, the report said.
