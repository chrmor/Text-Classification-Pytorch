Blackout shuts down San Onofre nuclear reactors
The blackout affecting large swaths of San Diego County led to a shutdown of two reactors at the San Onofre nuclear power plant.
Gil Alexander, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, said the power outage did not cause any safety issues. Alexander said a fluctuation in power caused the reactors to shut down at 3:38 p.m. but that the overall plant continues to have power.
He said the system worked as it was supposed to during a loss of power.
Across San Diego, businesses are closed, traffic is snarled and the trolley system is down. San Diego International Airport was on backup generators.
There were reports that power was also out in southern Orange County, Imperial County, Tijuana, Arizona and Palm Springs.
The city of San Diego has set up its emergency operations center.
Sheriff's officials told Fox 5 San Diego that many of its substations were without power. Utility officials are trying to figure out what cause the outage.
