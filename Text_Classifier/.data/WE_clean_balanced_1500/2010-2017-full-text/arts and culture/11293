Emmy winners 2017: the complete list
The 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards aired on Sunday, September 17, and honored the best TV series and performances that aired between June 2016 and May 2017.
No doubt each year’s Emmys ceremony has its own dominant storylines (the 2016 Emmys largely belonged to Game of Thrones and Veep, for example). This year, the biggest stories were HBO’s Big Little Lieswinning five awards, notably in the Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress in a Miniseries categories, Outstanding Directing in a Miniseries, and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries categories.
The other huge winner of the night was freshman series and first-time nomineeThe Handmaid’s Tale. The show won five awards on Sunday: Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series, and Outstanding Writing in a Drama series, in addition to Ann Dowd winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Elisabeth Moss winning Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Combined with Alexis Bledel’s previous win for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama, a cinematography award, and a production design award, which were announced at last week’s Creative Arts Emmys, the show racked up eight Emmys total.
