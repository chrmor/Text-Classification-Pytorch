Suspected 'spy' returns to Israel
An Israeli man freed by Libya after being held for five months on suspicion of spying has flown back home, with Israel praising Tripoli for its handling of secret negotiations to secure his release.
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, accompanying Rafael Hadad on a flight from Austria, said the Libyans had "behaved in a very responsible way", speaking to journalists at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv.
"I can't say much but their demands were very reasonable, very responsible, logical demands," he said on Monday.
Hadad, who holds Israeli and Tunisian nationalities, was detained in March while reportedly taking photographs of properties once owned by Jews, on behalf of an Israel-based historical society.
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that as part of the deal, Israel agreed to the transfer of 20 prefabricated houses supplied by Libya to Gaza stored at the Egyptian port of El-Arish.
