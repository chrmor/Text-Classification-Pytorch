Black Sunday fires: blaze is contained but residents warned to be vigilant
RAGING bushfires that destroyed 64 homes are contained and under control but residents are still on alert as conditions in Kelmscott and Roleystone remain unpredictable.
FESA have downgraded the bushfire after bringing the blaze under control just after 6.30pm but are warning residents that a fire is still burning and that conditions are changing.

In a statement FESA issued a watch and act warning for Roleystone and Kelmscott.
"The bushfire is contained and under control, however people need to remain vigilant due to strong easterly winds in the area," the statement said.
"There is a possible threat to lives and homes as a fire is burning and conditions are changing."
Some residents are being allowed back into the scorched areas to see their homes but it could be at least two more days before some families evacuated from Kelmscott-Roleystone can return, with fire authorities fearing the blaze may flare again.
The blaze burned out-of-control for more than 32 hours and has devastated 440 hectares of land.
Senior police today warned that anyone who tried to enter the fireground to access their properties may be arrested.
Police also announced that once the area was safe enough to be reopened, they would station officers in the fire zone around-the-clock to ensure looters stayed at bay.
In a statement FESA issued a watch and act warning for Roleystone and Kelmscott.
"The bushfire is contained and under control, however people need to remain vigilant due to strong easterly winds in the area," the statement said.
"There is a possible threat to lives and homes as a fire is burning and conditions are changing."
Meanwhile a police officer has been reportedly questioned by arson investigators over the start of the bushfire that has destroyed at least 64 homes across Roleystone and Kelmscott.
The male police officer was reportedly off duty when he was using an angle grinder, which sparked the terrifying blaze.
A Bureau of Meteorology spokesman said last week's devastating Cyclone Yasi was not fanning the fires across Perth, instead they were the result of strong winds up to 80km/h that were "usual at this time of the year".
So far, the fire has burnt out 381ha, destroyed 64 homes and damaged another 32 properties.
The most seriously affected homes were in the area east of Buckingham St, authorities said. Other homes around Martin St, Clifton St, Ciro Rd, Turner Rd and the lower scarp also affected.
At a community meeting at the Armadale Arena recreation centre today, authorities put up maps of the fire zone before splitting the group into three geographical groups where they privately broke the news to residents whose homes had been razed or damaged.
About 700 people were at the public meetings at 10.30am and 12pm today, with the second one scheduled after double the number of people expected turned up for the first one.
Many emerged with red eyes and tear-stained faces, while others expressed relief their homes had been saved. Counselling was offered to distraught residents.
Speaking at the meeting, Armadale Mayor Lynton Reynolds reassured the community they would pull together and would get through the devastation.
"Thank you for the way in which you’ve faced this tragedy and thank goodness we’re not here today talking about loved ones that we’ve lost,’’ he said.
FESA incident controller Gary Kennedy said the southern section was contained and firefighters were working hard to shore up containment lines.
But he said there was still concern about the spot fires, brought on by the strong easterly winds.
"The fire is uncontrolled because of the wind…and the ember attack is still a real threat out there,’’ Mr Kennedy said.
"Overall, I believe we have the fire in as best position as we can possibly have…But there is a lot of work to be done. Crews will be working extremely hard throughout the day.
He said one if the biggest safety threats was trees and power poles, which were literally dropping to the ground without warning.
South East Metropolitan District Superintendent Daryl Gaunt said police appreciated that people were keen to return to their homes, but emergency services personnel would not take any safety risks and the fireground was still a hazard with spot fires and unstable trees and power poles.
He said police would not hesitate to arrest anyone who put their safety or the safety of others on the line.
"You cannot get back in there,’’ Supt Gaunt said.
"If you try to get back in there we might have to arrest people or take other legislative action to stop you going in there.
"Once the fire zone and the fire is fully suppressed, police will stay there and maintain a 24-hour presence in that area to secure your properties.
"Once that happens we will be helping you with your property security to stop looters or anything like that eventuating…We won’t walk away when the fire is over.’’
FESA chief operations officer Craig Hynes said the full damage toll was not yet clear and would emerge in coming days.
"I understand the desire for people to get back in there – it’s the pets they’ve left behind, their personal belongings, their lifelong memories. We can understand that,’’ Mr Hynes said.
"But really, you’ve got to understand that even after a fire is out, you’ve got very dangerous areas with fallen trees and powerlines.
"It’s going to be a long recovery process. We’ve been through this before and we know how much they are hurting. We’re going to give them every support we can.’’
Western Power have said they will try and restore power to houses in the affected area tonight.
In a statement they said: "There are currently 1612 customers without power in the Kelmscott/ Roleystone area.
"Power was shut off to these areas at the request of FESA, to keep the area safe for firefighters.
"FESA will advise when Western Power crews can enter the area and begin assessment and restoration work.
"There has been significant damage to the network in some areas and power restoration will progressively occur over the coming days.
"It is hoped some restoration work can begin tonight, however it is unlikely Western Power crews will have access to all affected areas until tomorrow.
"Western Power is currently in the process of bringing equipment to the area, to help speed up the power restoration work when FESA advises it is safe to proceed.
"A Western Power caravan and staff will be dispatched to Roleystone tomorrow morning to provide regular updates to affected residents and explain the process of reconnecting power."
Eyes of the world on Perth
PERTH'S bushfires have made headlines around the world with people eager to hear the news of how West Australians are dealing with the disaster.
Many people across Britain have used the pages of PerthNow to ask about loved ones they know living in the areas affected, while news organisations including the BBC's World Service have been following the local updates.
The devastating bushfires have moved the disaster spotlight on WA just days after rolling news was providing updates on Cyclone Yasi and the overwhelming flooding of Queensland, Victoria and communities across the east coast.
The terrifying bushfires have also caught global attention coming two years after the widespread devastation in Victoria which killed 173 people.
PREMIER Colin Barnett has declared fire-affected regions in the Perth hills a natural disaster area as firefighters continue to battle three separate wildfires across the city.
Mr Barnett said residents who had lost homes would be eligible to receive $3000 through the initiative, while $1000 would go to residents who had suffered significant damage to their properties.
Residents could also receive funds through the WA Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements initiative now the fire was declared a natural disaster.
The City of Perth has also launched a Perth Hills Bushfire appeal. Donations can be made at any Bankwest branch.
The Department for Child Protection has asked volunteers not to send household items or clothes to relocation centres as there were now sufficient supplies and the centres were being clogged up.
Insurance premiums to go up
Prime Minister Julia Gillard urged her colleagues in Parliament to think of residents in Perth suffering from the fires.
"There is pressure on today in Western Australia, pressure on those who know their homes are gone and pressure on those who are still battling these bushfires," she told Parliament.

Initial investigations have determined the cause of a blaze in Kelmscott was accidentally caused by a person using a grinder.
This morning, FESA chief operations officer Craig Hynes said firefighters were able to contain the Kelmscott fire from getting any bigger overnight, amid dangerous conditions and strong easterly winds up to 75km/h fanning the blaze.
Fires at Red Hill and in Roleystone remain out of control and the greatest concern to authorities. Almost 200 firefighters are battling the Roleystone blaze and crews from as far as Albany were recruited to help the battle.
Mr Hynes said latest information indicated 42 houses had been razed and 19 were partially damaged. Initial information showed that some homes lost were those of firefighters and police officers, he said.
"That number could increase. We are doing significant surveys at the moment with specialist damage assessment teams here at the Roleystone incident,’’ he said.
"We are very concerned about the safety of the fireground and we are doing our best to make sure that there are no injuries. Life is our priority.’’
Firefighters fear up to 60 properties in the City of Armadale region will be devastated by the bushfires.
At Red Hill, authorities have allowed some people to return to the area. There have been no reported losses at that fire.
Additional resources including an aerial rotary craft and experienced incident management staff have been brought over from Victoria.
MORE than 200 students and about fifteen staff members from Good Shepherd Catholic Primary School in Kelmscott have been forced to relocate to another school today as a bushfire rages around the town.
Unconfirmed reports were made on radio stations yesterday that the Arbuthnot Street school had been damaged by the fire, which has so far claimed more than 40 homes and burnt about 400 hectares.
Catholic Education Office director Ron Dullard conceded this morning he simply did not know if the primary school had survived the fire but was hopeful it was not affected.
He said parents had been advised to bring students to the Lumen Christi College in Gosnells today.
"Some of the parents and their kids haven’t been home, many of them were evacuated yesterday," Mr Dullard said.
"They (students and staff) will be here for about two days at this stage, but at the moment we don’t know what has happened to the school.
"We believe it has not been affected but we just don't know."
Mr Dullard said so far things were running smoothly at Lumen Christi College.
“We are just trying to make things as normal as possible for the kids and teach them as normal,” he said.
THIS morning, the mass show of community spirit was palpable.
A steady stream of community members, some total strangers, stopped at the Armadale Arena evacuation site dropping off food, toiletries and clothes, while dozens of others came asking "What can I do to help?’’.
Volunteers Cam Plater and Jen Oxford arrived at the centre at 8pm last night to lend a hand. They say they will stay until they are no longer needed.
"We have been helping out with people, pets, anything that needs to be done, we’re just helping out,’’ Mr Plater told PerthNowthis morning.
"It’s a case of all hands on deck."
Mr Plater said he had been astounded at the number of donations.
"It’s just amazing what people bring and how quickly it started coming in," he said.
FESA chief operations officer Craig Hynes said the fire in the City of Armadale was started accidentally by someone using a grinder.
The fire in the City of Swan is believed to be started after strong winds snapped a tree branch which then fell on to an electrical unit.
The Roleystone blaze that threatened lives has been burning for more than 24 hours and destroyed more than a 1170 hectares.
Police have launched an arson investigation due to the size of the bushfire outbreaks throughout Black Sunday.
A police spokesperson said: "While it is too early to determine the cause of the fires, I can confirm we have pro-actively deployed Arson Squad detectives due to the size of this incident and the fact homes have been lost."
Mr Hynes said the blaze in Roleystone could destroy more homes.
"The fire is uncontrolled, it is at risk of running in a highly populated area," he said.
"It (the number of homes damaged) could increase anything up to 60."
On Sunday evening part of the Buckingham Bridge on Brookton Highway collapsed after it was badly burnt.
So far residents have only been reported suffering from smoke inhalation.
FESA have confirmed that one volunteer firefighter is now in a stable condition after being seriously injured at one of the fire sites.
Mr Hynes said they had prepared for the weekend's weather conditions and were doing everything they could to bring the fires under control.
"We have prepared for this weekend. We knew these conditions were going to be bad," he said.
"We were prepared, we put extra resources in place and on standby."
Mr Hynes said Victorian firefighters had been brought in to help tackle the fires.
"We previously briefed the eastern states agencies that we may call upon their resources and in fact we have done that," he said.
Residents and staff at the Rivergarden Nursing Home on Clifton Street in Kelmscott were evacuated by Police and St John Ambulance as the fire threatened the facility.
Its understood 13 residents at the aged care home had to be stretchered out of the home and were taken to a nearby shopping centre.
Hundreds of residents on Perth's bush-fringed eastern rim spent yesterday nervously watching the blaze threatening their homes as gusting winds kept whipping it up.
Six helicopter water bombers and 150 firefighters battled the bushfire on Sunday as it raged out of control on the edge of the Darling Range, threatening farms, vineyards and lifestyle properties in the Swan Valley.
The fire, which started about 9.15pm (WST) on Saturday, forced more than 100 people to evacuate their homes overnight and had burnt through about 800 hectares by noon on Sunday.
Evacuations continued throughout the day as the fire advanced, residents packing up their pets and cherished possessions and loading horses and other livestock into floats and trailers.
FESA spokesman Rick Tyers said the fire was in "fairly inhospitable and rocky country'' that was difficult to get vehicles into so the aerial bombers were doing most of the firefighting.
"The winds are our worst enemy at the moment.
"If it gets very strong, they may have to cease the aerial attacks.''
Mr Tyers said the fire was surrounded but still out of control, unpredictable and threatening homes and it might take firefighters a couple of days to bring it under control.
An emergency warning remained in place for residents in Brigadoon, Baskerville, Millendon, Red Hill and Herne Hill in the City of Swan and a relocation centre has been set up at nearby Midvale.
Police roadblocks were in place around the fire with residents unable to return until the all-clear is given.
AS a broad band of smoke drifted across the wine-growing district, residents stood outside their properties to watch the blaze as it advanced down the hills and as helicopters worked in relay to douse it.
One resident, leaving the area at midday with her husband and two children, said they had been advised that if they did not leave, authorities could not be responsible for their safety.
Pets and cherished possessions were piled in the family's four-wheel-drive vehicle, and they had earlier shifted their five horses to safety elsewhere.
Denise and Lorry Cole were among those watching the fire's progress down a bushland ridge from a police roadblock on Sunday, unable to return to their home until given the all-clear.
They packed their toy poodle Monty, pet parrot Livingstone, photos and documents into their van and left their Padbury Avenue property in Herne Hill after midnight when authorities advised people to leave.
"The sky was bright red and sometimes you could see the flames, the wind was really gusty,'' Ms Cole said.
"The guys are doing their best. We're ex-army so we take these things in our stride,'' she said.
The Coles got no sleep overnight but were glad for coffee at the relocation centre where some evacuated residents turned up with horses in horse floats.
Other residents told PerthNowat the scene of the Brigadoon fire that not knowing where the fire was going was the biggest fear.
"I am not very concerned about the fire but the wind is very strong and of course embers are a bit of a worry," one resident said.
