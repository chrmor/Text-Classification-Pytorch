Kenyan military says its fighter jets have killed 30 militants in Somalia
The Kenyan military says it has killed at least 30 Islamic militants in an airstrike on a militant camp in Somalia.
A statement from the military Friday said fighter jets attacked the camp at Garbarahey in the Gedo region in Somalia on Thursday, where a meeting was being held.
Military spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir said on his Twitter account that al-Shabab leader Ahmed Godane was among the targets but was not killed. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the Sept. 21 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi in which 67 died at hands of gunmen. Kenya sent troops into Somalia to fight al-Shabab militants in 2011 following a cross- border attacks blamed on the militant group.
