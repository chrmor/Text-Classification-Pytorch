Top pro-Kurdish lawyer shot dead in Turkey's southeast
The head of the Diyarbakir Bar Association was shot dead in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir in the clearest sign of a deteriorating security situation in the country's southeast since elections this month.
Tahir Elci, 49, was killed this morning in clashes that broke out between security forces and militants during a press conference where he was speaking, according to Minister of Interior Efkan Ala. Both the Diyarbakir Bar and Pro-Kurdish HDP party called the killing an assassination.
One police officer was killed and three others wounded in the attack, state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Turkey declared a curfew in Diyarbakir's Sur district after the clashes broke out, according to Hurriyet newspaper.
The killing is the latest sign of the precarious security situation in Turkey's southeast after peace talks collapsed between the government and the PKK, which seeks autonomy for the country's ethnic Kurds. The Ak Party's landslide victory on November ended months of political deadlock.

The government will investigate to see if the attack was an assassination, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in televised remarks in Ankara. "Whoever may have done this, the target is clear. The target is not just Mr Tahir Elci, the target is Turkey," he said.
Elci was the president of the Diyarbakir Bar Association and a human rights activist who was well known to the Turkish public as a regular guest on national political talks shows. He was detained in October for saying that the PKK was not a terrorist organization and then released pending trial. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by the US, European Union and Turkey.
