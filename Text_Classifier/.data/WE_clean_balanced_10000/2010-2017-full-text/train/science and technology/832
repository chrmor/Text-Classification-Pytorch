Disease suspected in mass kill of 100K fish in Arkansas River
Busy days for the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission. In addition to determining why more than 3,000 blackbirds died New Year's Eve (apparently by flying into things during fireworks), the agency is trying to pinpoint what killed nearly 100,000 fish in the Arkansas River.
Because 99% of the fish were bottom-feeding drum, not a sport fish, disease is the likely culprit, an official told the Associated Press. Pollution or another toxin would have killed more species.
The kill was reported Thursday along a 20-mile stretch of the river. Some fish were alive but sick and were sent to the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff for testing.
