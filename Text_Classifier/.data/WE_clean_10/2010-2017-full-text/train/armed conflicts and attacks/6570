NATO sees no signs of Russian troops' withdrawal from Ukrainian border for now - May. 19, 2014
Rasmussen said that if the withdrawal of the Russian forces occurs, he would be the first to welcome such a development.
NATO has taken a double approach â€“ on the one hand, the Alliance has suspended almost all cooperation with Russia, on the other hand, it has decided to leave a channel open for political and diplomatic dialogue in the framework of Russia-NATO Council, Rasmussen said.
