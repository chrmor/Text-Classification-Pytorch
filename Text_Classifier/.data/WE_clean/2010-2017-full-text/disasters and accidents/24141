Powerful earthquake shakes Tajikistan
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) â€” A powerful earthquake has shaken Tajikistan, sending shockwaves to other Central Asian nations, but no casualties or damages have been reported immediately.
Authorities in Tajikistan nor in Kyrgyzstan would immediately comment on the possible damage.
The U.S. Geographical Survey said the epicenter of the 7.2 point earthquake was located in the east of Tajikistan, 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the nearest village.
An Associated Press reporter in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, south of Tajikistan, felt two tremors in the capital Bishkek within an hour before 11 a.m. local time. Authorities in Kazakhstan reported tremors in the country's largest city Almaty as well.
