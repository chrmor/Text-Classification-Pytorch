Parliament in Somalia Votes to Remove Prime Minister
MOGADISHU, Somalia — Somalia’s Parliament voted the prime minister out of office on Monday in a no-confidence motion, with 184 of 249 lawmakers in favor, after what was termed a “constitutional dispute” between the president and the prime minister, Somali officials said.
More than 100 members of Parliament filed the motion on Saturday against the prime minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon, accusing him of “ineffectiveness.” Debate on the motion started on Sunday as security in and around Parliament was tightened.
Mr. Shirdon asked Parliament on Sunday to be allowed to defend his government against the accusations, but he was rejected.
“Two hundred and forty-nine lawmakers voted. One hundred and eighty-four voted in favor of the motion against the prime minister, and 65 lawmakers opposed,” the speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawaari, announced. “Therefore, the motion has passed according to the Constitution.”
“I will write both the Somali president and the prime minister about the results now, and the prime minister will be in office until the president nominates his successor.” Mr. Osman said.
