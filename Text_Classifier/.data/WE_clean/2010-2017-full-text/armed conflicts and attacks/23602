Syrian activists: Rebels recapture village in country's west as major fighting continues
Activists say Syrian rebels have recaptured a village in the country's west, days after it was seized by government troops as part of a major offensive.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other activist groups say that a coalition of rebel fighters regained control over the village of Atshan in Hama province on Friday.
They say the rebels are fighting back multiple offensives by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government forces and allied militiamen. The offensives were launched last month with the help of Russian airstrikes providing the necessary air cover.
The rebels have been using U.S.-made Tow missiles effectively and have succeeded in some areas to halt or push back government troops.
