Webber must win final race to claim title
Australian Mark Webber will be right in the thick of the action when the Formula One season reaches a thrilling three-pronged denouement in Abu Dhabi this weekend.
Webber's second-placed finish behind Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel in Sunday's Brazilian GP kept both men alive in the title race, although Ferrari's Spanish ace Fernando Alonso remains in the box seat.
Alonso - who was third in the Brazilian GP - leads the overall standings with 246 points as he chases a third world title.
Webber - who is bidding to become Australia's first F1 champion in three decades - is second on 238 and Vettel is third on 231, having won two of the last three GPs.
The Red Bull duo have had their differences in 2010 with Webber claiming that the team favoured the young German.
Now with Red Bull having wrapped up the constructors championship at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo, Webber will claim the drivers' title if he wins in Abu Dhabi and Alonso finishes no higher than third.
