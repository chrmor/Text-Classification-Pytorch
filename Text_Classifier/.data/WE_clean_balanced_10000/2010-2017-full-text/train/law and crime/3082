Woman charged in most recent of more than 70 arsons on Virginia's Eastern Shore
A woman has been charged in connection with the latest of more than 70 arsons on Virginia's Eastern Shore.
State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller says 40-year-old Tonya S. Bundick was arrested shortly after midnight Monday near a vacant residence in the town of Melfa that had been set on fire.
The fire was reported at 11:40 p.m. Monday. It was quickly extinguished and damage was minimal.
Bundick was being held Tuesday at the Accomack County Jail without bond on arson and conspiracy charges. It was unclear if she had an attorney.
There have been more than 70 arsons in Accomack County since November.
Geller said it was too early to say whether the latest arson is linked to the others or whether Bundick was a suspect in the others.
