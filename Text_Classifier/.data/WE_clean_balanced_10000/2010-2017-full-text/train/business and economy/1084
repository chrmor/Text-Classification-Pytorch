After Nearly $200 Million Dell Flub, T. Rowe Price Seeks a Solution
After a nearly $200 million blunder, one of Americaâ€™s largest mutual-fund companies is racing to find a way to compensate thousands of clients.
T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is likely to announce as early as next week a plan to reimburse clients who lost out when it accidentally voted in favor of the 2013 buyout of Dell Inc. by its founder Michael Dell, according to people familiar with the matter.
