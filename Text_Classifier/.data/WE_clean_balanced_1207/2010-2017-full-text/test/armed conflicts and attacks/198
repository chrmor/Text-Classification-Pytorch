Bahrain sentences four democracy protesters to death
The four were all from the island kingdom's Shia majority, which has led protests against the rule of the Sunni Muslim monarchy.
The Shia complain they suffer discrimination and are excluded from the best jobs in Bahrein, as well as being condemned by the election system to a minority voice in the country's parliament.
A report on the state news agency website confirmed that the four, named as Ali Abdullah Hassan al-Singees, 21, Qasim Hasan Matar Ahmad, 20, Saeed Abduljalil Saeed, 20, and Abdulaziz Abdulridha Ibrahim Husain, 25, had been found guilty of murder by the National Safety Lower Court. Three other men were sentenced to life in prison.
The state of national safety is the government's term for a state of emergency imposed when troops were sent in to clear public squares occupied by protesters last month.
The report described the deaths of the two officers as "one of the most gruesome murders in Bahrain". It was captured on camera, and videotapes were shown to the court.
The sentences were attacked by the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, which said that special courts imposed by the state of emergency "violated international standards".
"We demand the international community and organisations for urgent action to stop the trials against demonstrators," a spokesman said.
Thirty people died in the unrest, most when they were fired on by soldiers, including from the "Peninsula Shield" force of troops sent in by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Four died in police custody.
Execution in Bahrain is by firing squad, though the defendants all have the right to appeal.
