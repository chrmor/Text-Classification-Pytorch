Taiwan protests after officials 'barred by China' at OECD meet
Taiwan said Tuesday it would protest to Beijing and Belgium after its delegation was barred at a global industry conference in Brussels due to complaints from China. It is the latest bout of diplomatic sparring between Taiwan and China as tensions simmer ahead of the inauguration of Taiwan's president-elect, Tsai Ing-wen, in May. Taiwanese officials attending the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) steel symposium in Brussels were barred from a meeting Monday after China complained to Belgium they were not sufficiently high-ranking, Taiwan's economic ministry said. Taiwan is not an OECD member but has attended the organisation's steel committee meetings since 2005 .
