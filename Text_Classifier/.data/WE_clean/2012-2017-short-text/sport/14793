In arbitration, U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman overturns the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's four-game suspension of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The judge rules that Brady had been given no notice that ball deflation would result in a suspension. The NFL announces that they will appeal the ruling. (AP) (ESPN)
