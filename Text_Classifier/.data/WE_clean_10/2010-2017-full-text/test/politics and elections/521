YouTube Blocked In Turkey
YouTube has been blocked in Turkey as a newly leaked recording purportedly includes high-level Turkish officials discussing possible military operations in Syria to secure the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman empire.
Another leaked voice recording suggests that Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan orchestrated the release of Baykal's (former Republican People's Party leader) sextape in 2010.
Erdogan also tried to block Twitter ahead of elections (with moderate success) and threatened to block Facebook. His ruling AKP party has been embroiled in a wide-ranging corruption scandal for months.
