Highlights: India State Election Results
The SP looks set for a landslide victory with a total of 221 of the state assembly’s 403 seats, according to Election Commission data.
But how did the party succeed in recovering so much of the ground it lost at the last state elections?
Above all, the SP benefited from a strong anti-incumbency wave. As U.P.’s second-largest party after the ruling BSP, it was well placed to fare better than other opposition parties.
It also did a relatively good job at partly shedding its lawless image – one of the reasons it was voted out of power in 2007. “They have been able to transcend their previous image” through skillful image management, says Anil Kumar Verma, professor of political science at Christ Church College in Kanpur.
During campaigning, SP politicians vowed they would not tolerate criminal behavior from any of their party members.
“They were able to win the confidence of the people by saying they won’t allow their grassroots politicians to do what they did last time,” said Prof. Verma.
This apparently worked, despite the fact that the SP fielded a greater number of candidates facing criminal charges than any of other party in U.P. (A recent report estimates that 50% of the party’s candidates are alleged criminals, though the party claims they are innocent.)
The party’s PR efforts - and the electoral success that followed – owed a lot to Mulayam Singh Yadav’s son Akhilesh, who spearheaded the campaign in the state. Mr. Verma says he has to be given “full credit” for projecting a young and pro-development image and that this was integral to the SP’s good showing at the polls.
