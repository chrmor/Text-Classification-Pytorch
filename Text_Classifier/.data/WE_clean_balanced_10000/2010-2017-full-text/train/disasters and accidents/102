Mexico's Colima volcano erupts, forcing nearby communities to evacuate
Mexico's Colima volcano has erupted, spewing a large plume of ash and thick black smoke into the sky and forcing the evacuation of two nearby villages.
Chief of National Emergency Services, Luis Felipe Puente, said some 350 villagers living in the shadow of the volcano in the towns of La Yerbabuena and La Becerrera had been evacuated to a nearby shelter.
The volcano is located in western Mexico between the states of Colima and Jalisco, about 500 kilometres from Mexico City.
It is one of the most active volcanoes in the country and Central America.
Colima, also known as fuego — or fire — has had more than 30 periods of eruption since 1585, including several significant eruptions in the late 1990s.
