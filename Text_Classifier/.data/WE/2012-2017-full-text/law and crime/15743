FBI taking larger role in Gilgo Beach murders investigation
The FBI is taking a more prominent role in the search for the Gilgo Beach Killer, authorities announced at a press conference today.
The update comes nearly five years after the first body connected to the case was found on Dec. 11, 2010.
Federal investigators had been involved in aspects of the investigation, Suffolk County Deputy Police Commissioner Tim Sini said, but additional FBI input could help to solve the case.
"We are dedicated to doing everything we can to solve this case," Sini said. "Rest assured, this case remains active."
Authorities declined to discuss specific details about the investigation, along with whether any searches were conducted to find additional bodies.
Ten bodies were found near the south shore beach in Suffolk County between December 2010 and April 2011.
The case has drawn international attention â€” but at this point, no arrests.
The search for Shannan Gilbert, a missing hooker from Jersey City, N.J., eventually turned up the other murder victims dumped on the barrier island, with authorities theorizing the slayings were the work of a single killer.
