Current Storm Status: Storm Forecast: Swell for Hawaii:premium forecast  Swell for Pacific Northwest/Canada: premium forecastThis will be the last update on Ignacio.   As of 11AM HST on Friday, September 4th, Tropical Storm Ignacio is located at 34.1N 164.2W or 965 miles NNW of Honolulu, HI. Ignacio has maximum sustained winds of 60kts with a minimum central pressure of 983mb. The system is currently moving North (355 degrees) at 15kts. Ignacio is expected to maintain strength or slowly weaken over the next couple of days as it tracks to the north. As it gains latitude it will encounter stronger westerlies which will turn the system to the east and push it towards the Pacific Northwest, into the Gulf of Alaska as it undergoes extra-tropical transition.  Modest NW-NNW swell will continue for best northerly exposures of Hawaii through the weekend and even lingering the first half of next week. Swell will quickly weaken/fade thereafter. For more on local timing/size be sure to check the Surfline  premium forecast  for further details on this evolving storm. As Ignacio turns to the east and undergoes extra-tropical transition it will likely send a medium to locally solid pulse of West trending WNW-NW swell to breaks in the Pacific Northwest/Canada around the middle of next week. North/Central California will see a modest to locally fun size share of this swell at that time. Check out the  premium forecast  for details. 
The system should be a post-tropical cyclone by Monday as it curves to the northeast and moves into the higher latitudes, eventually tracking towards the Canadian coast.
