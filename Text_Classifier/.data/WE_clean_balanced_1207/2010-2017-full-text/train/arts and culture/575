Brief encounter: Pants off subway day goes global
Thousands of commuters around the world went to work today without their trousers on.
Withstanding freezing temperatures while wearing boxer shorts, Y-fronts and big knickers, brave advocates celebrated the ninth annual 'pants off subway day', a craze which originated in New York but has travelled across the globe.
Organisers of the event, Improv Everywhere, said it "went off without a hitch" with an estimated 3,000 people taking their pants off to ride to work.
London was among the 44 cities across 16 countries to take part in the spectacle, which may have surprised a few people peering over their newspapers this morning.
