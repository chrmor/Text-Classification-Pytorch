In Russia’s Shadow, Abkhazia Elects President
SUKHUMI, Georgia — Aleksandr Z. Ankvab has been elected president of Abkhazia, a rebel enclave of Georgia still struggling for legitimacy three years after Russia unilaterally declared it a sovereign nation.
Abkhazia’s Central Elections Commission announced on Saturday that Mr. Ankvab, the former vice president, won with nearly 55 percent of the vote, besting two opponents.
The election, which was held on Friday, was fairly unusual for regions of the former Soviet Union in that the outcome was not known beforehand, and it appeared to adhere to democratic principles.
But observers said the results would do little to alter politics in Abkhazia, a slice of subtropical land on the Black Sea that is dependent on Russia for its survival.
Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another breakaway Georgian enclave, in August 2008, shortly after winning a brief war with Georgia over the territories. So far, Russia is the only major country to have done so, and it remains both regions’ sole guarantor of security and economic viability.
