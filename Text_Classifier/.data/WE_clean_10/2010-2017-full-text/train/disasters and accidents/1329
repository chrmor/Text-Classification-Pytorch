More than 4,000 evacuated after Indonesia volcano eruption
Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- More than 4,000 residents have been evacuated from a central Indonesian province after a volcano erupted, sending smoke high into the sky.
Mt. Lokon in the northern Sulawesi province first erupted Thursday night. A second eruption occurred early Friday morning, authorities said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, but teams were assessing damage, said the country's disaster management agency.
Indonesia is located on the "Ring of Fire," an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
