Rebels allied to al-Qaeda shoot down Syrian regime jet
Pictures posted online showed rebels speeding to the scene of the crash and surrounding the pilot, who had parachuted to safety.
A middle-aged man with grey hair, he is shown with traces of blood and lying on the ground, clearly dazed.
According to the rebels, the jet had been bombing the town of Tel al-Eis, near Aleppo. It had been held for some time by rebels before being recaptured by the regime, and then captured again by a coalition of non-jihadist rebels and Jabhat al-Nusra over the weekend.
The area where the plane crashed is held by Jabhat al-Nusra, which is thought to have seized the pilot. The shot which brought the jet down was claimed by Ahrar al-Sham, another hardline Islamist group currently fighting alongside Jabhat al-Nusra.
The fighting around Aleppo has devolved into a confusing morass in recent months, with non-Isil rebels, Jabhat al-Nusra, Isil, the regime and allied Shia militias brought into the conflict by Iran, Russian forces, and Kurdish fighting groups all competing for territory.
A ceasefire had lessened the violence, but it excluded Jabhat al-Nusra, which has continued to fight regime positions.
How the jet was shot down will be of some importance - rebel groups have a very limited supply of low-end surface-to-air missiles, mainly captured from regime bases. They have been denied access to high-end missiles by their Gulf state backers due to US pressure, for fear they might get into the hands of jihadist groups.
If Jabhat al-Nusra has somehow gained access to high-end missiles, it will trigger universal concern about future dangers to civilian as well as military aircraft.
