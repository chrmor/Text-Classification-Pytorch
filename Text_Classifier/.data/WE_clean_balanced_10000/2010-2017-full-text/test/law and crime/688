Baby found in plane bin in Philippines
Cleaners sweeping through a passenger jet that landed at the Philippines' main international airport found a newborn baby dumped in a bin in a toilet yesterday.
The clean-up crew quickly alerted airport doctors to the surprise discovery aboard the Gulf Air flight, which had just landed from Bahrain and was preparing for a turn-around flight, an airport official said.
The baby boy was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared healthy and turned over to social welfare officers, the official said.
Pictures taken by airport photographers showed the baby swathed in a towel while doctors warmed him up under a light bulb.
Airport officials said they named the mystery baby "Jorge Francis" and efforts to locate his parents would be left to social welfare officials.
Officials from Gulf Air office in Manila were not available to comment.
