6 Iraqis killed in Baghdad explosions
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Six people, including an Iraqi Interior Ministry official and four members of a leading political bloc, died in multiple explosions Thursday throughout Baghdad.
Four people were killed when a roadside bomb struck a convoy carrying Abdul Karim Mahood, a key ally of former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, according to Baghdad police. The blast, apparently targeting members of Allawi's al-Iraqiya political coalition, occurred Thursday afternoon in Jurf al-Nadaf, an area in southeastern Baghdad.
In addition to the four fatalities, three others were wounded, though Mahood himself escaped unharmed. In Iraq's national election earlier this March, Allawi's bloc edged out Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition by two seats for the 325-member parliament. But Iraq has still not formed a coalition government, months after the March 7 election.
Earlier in the day, an employee with Iraq's Interior Ministry died after a sticky bomb attached to a car exploded in central Baghdad.
One civilian was killed and another was wounded in a roadside bomb incident Thursday morning, this one in the Baladiyat area of eastern Baghdad. Around that time, another roadside bomb struck a vehicle in central Baghdad, wounding two employees with a civilian defense unit.
