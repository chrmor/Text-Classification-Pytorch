SAS corporal 'extremely humbled' to get VC
SAS Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith says he is extremely humbled to receive the Victoria Cross for gallantry but he has urged Australians to always remember the digger heroes who have died fighting in Afghanistan.
The 32-year-old was awarded Australia's highest military honour by Governor-General Quentin Bryce at a special ceremony in Perth on Sunday.
Also present at the Campbell Barracks for the ceremony were Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott and Defence Force Chief Angus Houston.
Cpl Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia for conspicuous gallantry shown when taking on Taliban machine gun positions near the village of Tizak in Afghanistan's Kandahar Province on June 11 last year.
After the ceremony, the father of five-month-old twin girls, told reporters he was "extremely humbled" by the award but every member of his unit showed gallantry on the day and they too would be recognised with honours.
He also urged Australians to remember the digger "heroes" who did not come back alive from Afghanistan.
