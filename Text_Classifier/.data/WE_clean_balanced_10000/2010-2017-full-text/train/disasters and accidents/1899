24 Die After Iraqi Kurdish Refugees’ Boat Sinks Off Greek Island
LONDON — At least 24 people drowned and 11 others were missing after a boat carrying Iraqi Kurds sank off the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, close to the Turkish coast, the authorities said on Thursday.
The Italian Navy also rescued 290 migrants on Thursday and recovered six bodies from the water near a half-sunken rubber boat off Libya, en route to Italy. The navy rescued the migrants from three rubber boats. The six bodies were found near the third one, which was already sinking when the Italian vessel reached it.
More than 3,700 migrants died while trying to enter Europe via the Mediterranean Sea last year, and the latest sinkings were a reminder that the flow had not stopped in the dead of winter, despite near-freezing nighttime temperatures. Swedish and Dutch officials suggested this week that they were preparing new steps to deal with the problem.
Kelly Namia, an Athens-based representative of the International Organization for Migration, confirmed the death toll off Samos. According to accounts provided to the organization at a hospital, the wooden vessel was carrying 65 people when it sank on Wednesday night, even though it had a maximum capacity of 30.
