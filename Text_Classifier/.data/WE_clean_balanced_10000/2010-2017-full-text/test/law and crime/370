They stood on the prisoners’ heads and poured bottles of water on some of their faces in what, to a pair of Army soldiers, appeared to be an improvised form of waterboarding. A few hours earlier, shortly after dawn on May 31, 2012, a bomb had exploded at a checkpoint manned by an Afghan Local Police unit that the SEALs were training. Angered by the death of one of their comrades in the blast, the police militiamen had rounded up half a dozen or more suspects from a market in the village of Kalach and forced them to a nearby American outpost. Along the way, they beat them with rifle butts and car antennas." here (INTERNATIONAL) -- A 24-year old Afghan man, Muhammad Hashem, married and with a newborn son was beaten to death in an American military outpost in Afghanistan by U.S. Navy Seals who walked away from the homicide and were never charged due to a cover up by Navy officials, suggests an extensive new report on the incident by the New York Times.The report says Rachel E. VanLandingham, who was the United States Central Command’s chief legal adviser on detainee and interrogation issues from 2006 to 2010, has called for the case to be reopened, as did several other military lawyers who reviewed details of the case.“There’s more than sufficient information, evidence, data in the documents to more than warrant a new investigation,” Ms. VanLandingham told the Times. “The decision to dispose of these charges via anything but criminal prosecution was grossly flawed.”The Times report says even before the beatings of the three men that ended with Mr. Hashem dying, "Some of the SEALs had exhibited troubling behavior. According to the soldiers and Afghan villagers, they had amused themselves by tossing grenades over the walls of their base, firing high-caliber weapons at passing vehicles and even aiming slingshots at children, striking them in the face with hard candy."The report says the beatings of the men were in retaliation for a bomb that had exploded at an American checkpoint earlier.From the report:The story also says a United States Army medic standing guard at the base, Specialist David Walker, had expected the men from SEAL Team 2 to put a stop to the abuse but instead he said one of them “jump-kicked this guy kneeling on the ground.” Then two others joined in, according to several witnesses, and they beat the detainees so badly that by dusk Mr. Hashem was dead.In a damning indictment of the way the Navy investigation into the matter was handled, Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and former judge advocate general of the Navy, in charge of all its lawyers told the Times, “It’s unfathomable. It really does look like this was intended just to bury this.”The full report, found here also says Navy officials defend the handling of the case, saying the SEAL captain who oversaw it had full authority to decide it as he saw fit and that Seal Team 2 members denied abusing the detainees.
