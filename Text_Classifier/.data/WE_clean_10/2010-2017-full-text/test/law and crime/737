Tony Blair's personal details 'hacked'
The file, which also included the names, addresses and phone numbers of Mr Blair’s contacts, was being tweeted by users on Twitter on Friday night.
The link first appeared on pastebin.com, a website that allows users to upload text.
Included in the file was the apparent address and phone number of Lord and Lady Irvine and the Labour MP, Denis MacShane.
It also included the contact details of several Blairs and Booths, the maiden name of Mr Blair’s wife, Cherie, and a number for a dentist.
The document included a note at the top which read: “The information in this article was obtained in 2010 December. We still have access to the webmail server. Phone numbers may have changed but all the information is 100% legit (sic).”
PCmag.com reported that a member of a hacker group called Team Poison had leaked the personal information.
Team Poison said it had possessed the information for a year, according to the Twitter feed of TriCk, a member of the group.
TriCk tweeted: “Tony Blair’s Private Info is getting leaked tonight, so is his Personal Adivsors CV and UK MPs & Lords who supported the war in Iraq.”
It came as Travelodge warned customers that their details may have been stolen by hackers from its database.
This month, hackers published online the names, birth dates, addresses, emails, phone numbers and passwords of people who had entered contests promoted by Sony.
LulzSec, a hacker group, said it had infiltrated the firm’s systems.
