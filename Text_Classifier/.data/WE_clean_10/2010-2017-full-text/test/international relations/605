Protesters rally as Merkel voices support for austerity-hit Greece
"Merkel we are a free nation and not your colony," said one banner. Another read, "Merkel Raus (out, in German). Murderer of 3,500 Greeks," a reference to the number of Greeks who have taken their own lives, according to some estimates, as a result of the current hardship.
"It's very bitter obviously, sacrifices need to be made," she said. "But I think these are necessary measures that have to be taken, I think it was not easy for anyone to impose those measures on them, but these, I think, have been made on the background of great experience."
While some within her own governing coalition have spoken of the need for contingency plans for a possible Greek exit from the euro, Merkel has signaled that she would view that outcome as extremely risky. However, many German taxpayers are opposed to committing more European funds to Greece.
"The democratic tradition of Europe will not allow a European people, the Greek people, to be transformed into a crisis 'guinea pig' and for Greece to become a vast social cemetery. We will win in the end, because we are right and we are many," he said.
Many of the protesters were retirees, a group that has lost, in many cases, more than 30% of its income since the crisis hit. Retirees are also among the groups that will be most affected by the new measures to which Greece must agree in order to receive the next tranche of its international bailout loan.
Maria Kirioni, a 53-year-old civil servant, told CNN she was protesting for the first time since she was a university student. "Merkel does not know what is going on in Greece. She only hears the politicians' voices. We must show her. It would be better if she stayed longer to see the reality," Kirioni said.
However, Wolfango Piccoli, director of Eurasia Group, says that the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone remains "marginal" at the moment and that the so-called troika -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will provide Greece with the next tranche of bailout funds to meet its debt obligations.
"The vast majority will come from an additional round of cuts to wages and pensions. It's going to be almost 8 billion euros of the 13.5 billion euros coming from that. The total cut is 11.5 billion euros and then 2 billion euros of additional taxes," he told CNN.
