Kansas City Royals Win 2015 World Series
The Kansas City Royals defeated the New York Mets 7-2 to win the World Series early Monday. This is the team's first World Series title since 1985.
Game 5 was another example of “death by Royals” for the Mets, and this one was by far the most painful for the team and their fans.
With their “Dark Knight” Matt Harvey working on an absolute gem through eight innings and a two-run lead, it appeared New York was on its way to forcing a Game 6. But, as it was in Games 1 and 4, things fell apart in the late innings.
Manager Terry Collins decided to let Matt Harvey start the ninth inning after the pitcher, despite having thrown well over 100 pitches, was persistent on staying in.
That decision ended up backfiring as Harvey walked Lorenzo Cain to leadoff. After Cain stole second, Eric Hosmer doubled him in. Collins then replaced Harvey for Jeurys Familia.
It could be argued that Collins went to his closer one batter too late for the second straight night.
Hosmer was eventually able to score on a ground ball by Salvador Perez. Even with the drawn in infield, the Royals' first baseman decided to make a mad dash for home plate as soon as David Wright made his throw to first base. First baseman Lucas Duda's throw to the plate was off-line, and the crowd's energy at Citi Field deflated as they saw another late-inning lead slip away.
