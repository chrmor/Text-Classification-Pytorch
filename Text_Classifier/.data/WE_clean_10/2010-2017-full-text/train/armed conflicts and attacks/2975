Air strikes hit rebel-held town in east Libya
AJDABIYAH, Libya (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched air strikes on Monday on the rebel-held Libyan town of Ajdabiyah after sweeping east, rebels said.
“The plane came round four times and bombed four times,” rebel fighter Abdel Qadr Hejazi told Reuters in Ajdabiyah, where a Reuters correspondent saw two of the fresh blast craters near a rebel checkpoint at the western entrance to the town.
Other rebels also said there had been several air strikes on Monday morning on Ajdabiya, which lies about 140 km (90 miles) south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.
