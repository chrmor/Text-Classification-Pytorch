Ted Cruz wins most delegates at stake in Wyoming
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took the Wyoming GOP caucuses by a wide margin Saturday night as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won in Washington, DC.
Cruz won 66 percent of the vote from the Cowboy State’s county conventions and claimed nine delegates.
Rubio, who earned 20 percent of the vote, and front-runner Donald Trump, who tallied 7 percent, each added one delegate to their totals.
Wyoming’s remaining delegates will be allocated at a state convention April 16.
In the nation’s capital, Rubio earned 37 percent of the vote and claimed 10 delegates.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in second with 36 percent, earning him 9 delegates.
The DC and Wyoming votes were the last contests before five state primaries Tuesday, when 367 GOP delegates will be up for grabs.
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton added to her lead over Bernie Sanders, winning the Northern Mariana Islands. She picked up four delegates to Sanders’ two and now is ahead by 1,231 to 576.
