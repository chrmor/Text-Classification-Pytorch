Brexit live: thousands 'march for Europe' in post-referendum protest - as it happened
I’ve arrived at Parliament Square, which is overflowing with thousands of demonstrators. A sea of people waving flags, banners and placards have gathered in the shadow of Big Ben to voice their anger at the Brexit vote.
Guest speakers are delivering speeches from a stage set up in front of the square, including David Lammy MP, who is campaigning to have the decision voted down in the Commons. “Look at this Nigel Farage, look at this Boris Johnson, look at this Michael Gove,” he told the crowd. Lammy was followed by Sir Bob Geldof, who told the crowd he felt “bereft”.
Between speeches, chants broke out. “Fromage not Farage”, “never gonna give EU up”, “nothing compares 2 EU”, “Don’t EU want me baby” and “they lied to leave – is that democracy?” were among the slogans and messages written on banners held aloft in the square.
