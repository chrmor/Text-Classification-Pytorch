Mini-tornado hits Canning Vale as storm tears through Perth
A mini-tornado damaged 10 homes in Canning Vale and Perth drivers faced lengthy delays on the roads during peak-hours after a cold front swept through the city.
The front with its heavy rain caused dangerous flooding on roads this morning as Perth recorded its coldest day since September 13, last year, with the mercury reaching only 18.5 degrees.
It was also the city's wettest day in May in four years.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster John Relf said 34.6 millimetres of rain had fallen in the CBD today, including 20.4 millimetres in just 40 minutes.
