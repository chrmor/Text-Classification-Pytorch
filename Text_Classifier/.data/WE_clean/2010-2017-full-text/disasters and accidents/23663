The second cyclone in a week slammed into an island off Yemen's coast Sunday with 127-mph winds, the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane, killing at least two people, officials said.
Cyclone Megh hit the eastern portion of the Yemeni island of Socotra, according to AccuWeather. Megh is forecast to continue moving toward the mainland of Yemen, likely hitting as a tropical storm or depression on Tuesday or Wednesday, AccuWeather said.
Socotra, population 44,000, is a small island in the Arabian Sea, about 240 miles off the coast of Yemen.
Preliminary reports indicate that two people were killed by the storm, the World Health Organization tweeted Sunday.
Megh follows on the heels of Cyclone Chapala, which hit Yemen on Tuesday, killing at least nine people. Back-to-back cyclones affecting tiny Socotra Island within a week is unprecedented, according to weather.com.
"Jilaa, a village of around 1,150 persons in Shabwah governorate, was completely washed away" during Chapala, Andreas Needham, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said Friday.
More than 36,000 people were displaced by the storm, and at least 700 homes were damaged or destroyed, the U.N. said.
Megh could hit a more populated part of Yemen than Chapala did, according to Slate meteorologist Eric Holthaus.
Megh is the record 28th storm in the northern hemisphere this year that is Category 3 or stronger, according to hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University.
