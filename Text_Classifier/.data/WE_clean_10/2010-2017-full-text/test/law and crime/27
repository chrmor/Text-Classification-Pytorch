Man in military uniform with Nazi symbol injures 9 in Houston shooting
A man dressed in a vintage military uniform emblazoned with a Nazi symbol and toting a "Tommy Gun" and a hand gun unleashed a flurry of bullets near a Houston shopping center on Monday morning, injuring nine people before he was shot dead by police.
The shooter was identified as attorney Nathan DeSai, FOX26 reported, citing multiple sources. Authorities, however, refused to officially confirm the man's identity.
Officials said the gunman had 2,600 rounds of ammunition either on him or in his car and was carrying a .45 semi-automatic handgun and a .45 semi-automatic Thompson carbine. An "edged weapon still in its sheath" was also recovered from the shooter.
The man's apartment was filled with historic and vintage military items "going back to the Civil War," Houston Police Department Captain Dwayne Ready said during a Monday evening news conference.
Some video of the gun battle exists, Ready said, including footage from body cameras of some of the nine officers who fired upon the gunman. Ready said more than 75 spent shell casings were recovered from the scene, comprising both shots fired by the gunman and police officers.
An ATF official said both guns were purchased legally.
The accused shooter DeSai had previously worked at McDaniel & DeSai LLP, though the practice closed down at some point within the last year, Ken McDaniel told ABC13.
An ABC13 reporter who spoke with DeSai's father said the man had tried calling his son numerous times on Monday but had only gotten the man's voicemail. DeSai's father said his son was upset over the failure of his law firm and the business closed due to a lack of clients.
DeSai's father confirmed his son owned multiple guns and said he had a license to carry. He also said DeSai drove a black Porsche, the same type of car police were examing in the shopping center parking lot. That car's license plate showed it was registered to DeSai, ABC13 reported.
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said the gunman "appeared to be a disgruntled lawyer who took out his anger and frustration on individuals," KHOUreported.
The FBI said on Monday evening that there did not appear to be any nexus to terrorism.
DeSai's LinkedIn page shows he graduated from the University of Tulsa with a J.D. and the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in psychology.
Six of those wounded in the attack were transported to area hospitals. Three have since been released and one person was in critical condition. Three other victims were treated at the scene. Mayor Pro Tem Ellen Cohen said all victims were expected to survive.
A fire official said some people were shot while inside their cars and several people were hit with glass fragments from shattered car windows.
A nearby homeowner told FoxNews.com his wife woke up to gunshots at 6:30 a.m. Shortly thereafter police were seen going into a nearby condo.
A woman said her husband called as the shooting occurred and said, "I'm hit." The man told his wife that the gunman was shooting people with a "red light aimed through the front windshield."
"As I was driving by Law Street I suddenly heard a big explosion," Andrade said. "I covered myself, accelerated and tried to get out of there. I did not know if someone was following me or trying to shoot me."
