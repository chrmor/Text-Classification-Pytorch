Ecuador volcano: Spectacular eruption spews six-mile column of ash into the sky
A volcano has spewed a six-mile column of ash into the sky after a massive eruption.
The Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador erupted twice yesterday night.
Ecuador's geophysics institute said the first blast occurred at 6.10pm local time and was followed by a second, four-minute explosion and five lesser tremors.
The 16,480-foot volcano, nearly 90 miles south of Quito, revived on February 1, with eruptions that affected a third of Ecuador's provinces and temporarily closed a regional airport.
Tungurahua has been erupting sporadically since 1999. In 2006, a toxic cloud killed four people and left two missing.
It follows a series of large earthquakes off the coast of Chile earlier this week.
