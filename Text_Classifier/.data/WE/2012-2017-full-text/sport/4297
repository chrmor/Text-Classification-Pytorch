Rossi in for Ferrara at struggling Sampdoria
UC Sampdoria have parted company with coach Ciro Ferrara in the wake of the 3-1 defeat at Calcio Catania on Sunday and appointed Delio Rossi in his stead.
After starting the Serie A season with three consecutive wins, promoted Sampdoria are now 14th with 17 points, three above the relegation zone. Rossi, most recently in charge of ACF Fiorentina in a coaching career that has encompassed 11 clubs over more than two decades, will be unveiled to the press on Tuesday.
Ferrara, 42, had signed a two-year contract with the Blucerchiati in the summer after leaving his post at the helm of the Italy team who subsequently qualified for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.
Capped 49 times by the Azzurri, the former defender counts a UEFA Cup win with SSC Napoli and a UEFA Champions League success at Juventus among the many trophies he lifted as a player. Prior to his experience with the U21s he coached the Bianconeri in 2009/10.
Ferrara's departure follows that of Serse Cosmi from bottom club AC Siena. The 4-1 weekend reverse at Fiorentina was their third straight loss. Giuseppe Iachini, who was replaced as Sampdoria boss by Ferrara having led them to promotion via the Serie B play-offs last term, has been named as Cosmi's successor.
"I promise to bring enthusiasm and work as hard as I can to keep the team in Serie A," said Iachini. "If I'm here it is because I believe in the strength of these players."Â
