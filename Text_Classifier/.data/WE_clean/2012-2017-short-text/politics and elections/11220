On preliminary counts, the National Party, led by John Key, wins a majority of 61 seats in the new 121-seat 51st Parliament. It is the first time a single party has held a majority since New Zealand switched to the Mixed Member Proportional voting system in 1994. Official results are expected to be released on 4 October 2014. (NZ Herald)
