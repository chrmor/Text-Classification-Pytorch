Rolf Harris challenges indecent assault conviction
Entertainer Rolf Harris has applied for permission to appeal against his conviction for indecent assaults, a spokesman for the Judicial Office says.
Harris, 84, was jailed in July for five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults on four girls aged between seven or eight and 19.
The Judicial Office said his lawyers had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal.
A judge will now decide if his appeal bid should progress to a full hearing.
On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided not to refer Harris's sentence to the Court of Appeal despite 150 complaints over its "leniency".
Mr Wright said he did not think judges would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it.
Harris, an artist, TV presenter and musician, was found guilty of all 12 indecent assaults of which he was accused in his trial at Southwark Crown Court in London.
His victims included a young autograph hunter, two girls in their early teens and a friend of his daughter's against whom he committed a catalogue of abuse over several years.
The offences took place between 1968 and 1986.
Harris has been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia. He also faces losing his CBE.
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed it has received "a number of allegations" about Harris since his conviction, which are being investigated.
The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw, said it was unlikely that Harris's application for permission to appeal would be dealt with in the next few weeks.
"We are looking at a possible decision or possible hearing in the autumn," he said.
