Attack in Israeli City of Beersheba Leaves One Dead, at Least 11 Wounded
A gunman killed an Israeli soldier and wounded at least 11 other people at a bus station in southern Israel on Sunday as Palestinian-Israeli violence in the region continued.
Israeli police originally said two assailants were behind the attack in the city of Beersheba on Sunday, but police commander Yoram Halevy told The Associated Press that officers at the bus station mistakenly opened fire on a foreigner, who they thought was a suspect. He was injured.
The suspected gunman was killed after a long gun battle, police said.
