Riot police out on streets in Nigerian city
Four explosions went off on Friday as people went about their last-minute Christmas shopping, killing at least 32 and wounding more than 100. Another six people were killed in the north of the country after heavily-armed gangs attacked two churches.
Early on Sunday morning, Muslim and Christian youths took to the streets and the clashes that followed saw houses set alight and shots fired.
Mohammed Shittu, a leader of the Hausa Muslim community in Jos who headed a search and rescue team, said 14 bodies were recovered and 23 houses were burned down following Sunday's riots. He said another 33 people were wounded.
The violence saw Namadi Sambo, Nigeria's vice president, cancel a visit to inspect the Christmas Eve bomb damage. But Abdulrahman Akano, the state police commissioner, played down the severity of the unrest and said he had mobilised riot police to restore calm.
"There were some skirmishes between the two groups and it's under control now," he said. "My records show three killed. One or two houses were burned."
The latest incidents follow a period of relative calm after the death of hundreds of people in religious and ethnic clashes in the region at the start of the year.
Jos is the capital of Nigeria's central belt, where the Muslim north meets the largely Christian south, and thus the focal point of tensions between indigenous groups, mostly Christian or animist, and Muslim migrants and settlers from the north, who are vying for control of fertile farmlands and for economic and political power.
Tensions are also heightened – and, it is feared, being exploited – ahead of next year's elections. Goodluck Jonathan, a southern Christian and Nigeria's president, is seeking to extend his mandate despite a pact in the ruling party to rotate power between the north and the south of the country.
