ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry says it has lodged a protest with the Indian government over what it calls a series of “unprovoked ceasefire violations” in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
Troops on both sides have repeatedly exchanged gunfire and mortar shells in recent days, killing four Pakistanis and an Indian woman. The two sides exchanged fire again on Saturday, with no reported casualties.
In a Sunday morning statement, the ministry expressed its deep concern over India’s “offensive posture” in Kashmir. The Indian army contends that Saturday’s clash was initiated by Pakistan.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars since 1947 over their competing claims to the Himalayan region.
