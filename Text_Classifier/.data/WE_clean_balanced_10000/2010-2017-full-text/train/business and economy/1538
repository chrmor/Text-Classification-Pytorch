UPDATE 1-Cephalon wins pain-drug patent ruling vs Watson
NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. Court upheld a Cephalon Inc CEPH.O patent protecting its Fentora pain medicine in a dispute with generic drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc WPI.N, Cephalon said on Thursday.
The U.S. District Court in Delaware found that Watsonâ€™s proposed generic version of Fentora infringes the patent, Cephalon said. Fentora, which won U.S. approval in 2006, had about $180 million in sales last year.
