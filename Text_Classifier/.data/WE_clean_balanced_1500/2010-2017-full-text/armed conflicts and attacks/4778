Two killed in suspected leftist rebel attack ahead of Peru election
LIMA, April 9 (Reuters) - At least two people, including an army sergeant, were killed in an attack staged by suspected leftist Shining Path rebels on the eve of Peru's presidential election, authorities said.
Police said the attack, in a remote coca-growing region of the Andean nation, occurred early on Saturday and that three military officials were wounded. In addition to the army sergeant, one civilian was killed.
The Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group was largely dismantled in the 1990s, but hundreds of insurgents still control swaths of a jungle-covered region of Peru known for its production of coca, the raw material for cocaine.
Peruvians will vote on Sunday in the fourth presidential election since the end of a decade-long battle between insurgents and state security forces commanded by former President Alberto Fujimori that claimed an estimated 69,000 lives.
Fujimori is now serving a 25-year sentence for ordering death squads to massacre civilians in his crackdown on rebels.
The legacy of the conflict - one of Latin America's bloodiest - has surfaced in this year's presidential race as Peruvians who credit Fujimori with stamping out the Shining Path rally behind his daughter, front-runner Keiko Fujimori.
Keiko Fujimori is the clear favorite in Sunday's election but is not expected to win outright with a simple majority . She has marketed herself as the toughest candidate on crime.
