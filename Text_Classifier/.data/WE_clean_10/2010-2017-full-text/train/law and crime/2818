Undercover cop tells of 'living nightmare' after fleeing to America
THE undercover cop who posed as an environmental activist has fled to the US over fears for his safety.
Former Met officer Mark Kennedy said his life became a "living nightmare" after his secret role was revealed.
Last week, the a trial of six people accused of planning to invade Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station collapsed as charges were dropped.
The protesters' legal team said the decision came after Kennedy, who infiltrated the group disguised as climber Mark Stone, offered to give evidence on their behalf.
Kennedy said he believes tape recordings secretly made by him were kept from the court for fear it would destroy the prosecution's case.
He said:"The tapes clearly show that the six defendants who were to go on trial had not joined any conspiracy. It meant that the police couldn't prove their case."
Kennedy, 41, has denied "going rogue" and siding with the protesters, but he said:"I am in fear for my life.
"People like to think of things in terms of black and white, but the world of undercover policing is grey and murky. There is some bad stuff going on."
