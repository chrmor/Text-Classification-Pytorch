Yemen crisis: Many die in Saudi-led coalition air strike
An air strike by the Saudi-led coalition has killed at least 30 people in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, witnesses there have said.
It is unclear how many of the dead were were civilians or Houthi rebels who the coalition planes have been targeting.
The rebels captured the capital, Sanaa last year, forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi into exile.
Some 3,000 people have been killed since the Saudi-led campaign began in March, the UN says.
The latest strike hit a marketplace in Fayoush, a suburb of Aden, witnesses there said.
"[There was] blood from people mixed with that of the sheep and other livestock at the market," one resident told the Associated Press news agency.
Efforts are continuing to try to broker a humanitarian ceasefire that would run through Eid al-Fitr, a major Muslim festival, later this month.
Both the Houthis and the Yemeni government-in-exile have signalled a readiness to observe such a truce.
The UN has declared its highest-level of emergency in the country, with more than 80% of Yemen's population needing aid.
