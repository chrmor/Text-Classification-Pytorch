Nearly half a million people in Bangladesh have been made homeless and at least 15 people have been killed by three days of storms and heavy rain.
Waves of up to two metres swept through low-lying areas, flooding many homes.
Thousands of people had to leave for higher ground.
Some took refuge at cyclone shelters, while many simply set up camp beside the roads.
Storms and tidal surges are nothing new to Bangladesh, where many are killed nearly every year.
But the events of the last few days have shown how a large number of people can be affected in a very short space of time.
