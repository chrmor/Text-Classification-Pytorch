Egypt appoints former air force commander as PM
CAIRO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Egypt’s president picked on Saturday a former air force commander and aviation minister, Ahmed Shafiq, as the next prime minister, ensuring men with military links are in the top three political jobs.
Shafiq’s appointment followed announcement earlier on Saturday that Omar Suleiman, the intelligence chief with military experience, would be vice president and in prime position for the top job if Mubarak does not run in September.
Mubarak, 82, was also a former air force chief.
The move followed days of unprecedented protests that have shaken the country to its core. (Writing by Edmund Blair)
