Donovan breaks MLS goal record with Nos. 135, 136
CARSON, California (AP) â€” Landon Donovan broke the Major League Soccer scoring record Sunday with his 135th and 136th regular-season goals in the Los Angeles Galaxy's 4-1 victory over the Philadelphia Union.
Playing for the first time since being omitted from the U.S. World Cup team, Donovan surpassed the mark he shared with Jeff Cunningham in the 49th minute with his first goal in four games this season to give the Galaxy a 2-0 lead. He then added another goal in the 81st.
The 32-year-old American is also the U.S. scoring leader with 57 international goals.
"It's been a long week," he said. "It's hard not to make it about me, and I don't necessarily want it to be that way. But I've sacrificed a lot to be in the position I'm in and I was very happy for myself because I've dedicated a lot to this. I think I deserved what happened today."
Donovan was trying to make his fourth World Cup squad, but U.S. national coach Jurgen Klinsmann left him off the team heading to Brazil. Klinsmann had previously dropped him from the national team for the first half of 2013 after Donovan took a four-month sabbatical.
Donovan has played in 307 regular-season games in 15 MLS seasons.
The Jamaican-born Cunningham, a former U.S. national team player, played in 365 games over 14 seasons with Columbus, Colorado, Real Salt Lake, Toronto FC and FC Dallas. He last played in MLS in 2011.
