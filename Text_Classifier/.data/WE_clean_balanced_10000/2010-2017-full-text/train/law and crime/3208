Tsarnaev Joins A Death Row With Many Members, And Few Executions
Now that he's been formally sentenced to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will soon become a resident of federal death row, joining 61 other killers who've been condemned to die by lethal injection at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.
There he will wait â€” likely for a very long time.
Just how long depends on a range of factors, mainly the strength of his legal appeals and the future of lethal injection drugs. But it's safe to assume that it will be several years before he is put to death.
Despite the name, there isn't much death on death row.
