Harvey is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane before landfall. Harvey may then stall or meander for a few days, leading to a dangerous flood threat in parts of Texas and Louisiana. Hurricane, tropical storm and storm surge watches have been issued for parts of Texas.
Tropical Storm Harvey is expected to strengthen into a hurricane before bringing a extremely dangerous combination of rainfall and storm-surge flooding to areas near the Texas and Louisiana coasts into the weekend or early next week.
