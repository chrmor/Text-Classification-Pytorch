Kurds Launch Offensive to Retake ISIS-Held Iraqi Town of Sinjar
A statement from the Kurdish Regional Security Council said some 7,500 peshmerga fighters were closing in on the mountain town from three fronts. It added that Operation Free Sinjar is aimed at establishing "a significant buffer zone to protect the city and its inhabitants from incoming artillery."
Peshmerga fighters and the militants exchanged heavy gunfire early Thursday as Kurdish fighters began their approach amid heavy aerial bombardment. An Associated Press team saw a small American unit at the top of a hill along the front line calling in and confirming airstrikes.
Pentagon officials told NBC News early Thursday that 20 U.S. strikes had been launched overnight — hitting ISIS fighting positions, staging areas, a bunker and other targets. They said that U.S. special operations forces were also embedded as advisers, adding that they were "well back from the fighting.”
U.S. military officials said "hundreds" of ISIS fighters were believed to be in Sinjar.
