General Stanley McChrystal to lecture at Yale
The former US commander in Afghanistan who was dismissed after speaking to a magazine about his civilian bosses is to teach at a top US university.
Gen Stanley McChrystal will lecture at a new centre for global affairs, Yale University announced.
He will teach graduates in the international relations master's programme in the upcoming term.
Gen McChrystal was relieved of his command in Kabul in June and retired from the military in July.
He has been appointed a senior fellow with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, a new centre at Yale, the university said in a statement on Monday.
"General McChrystal brings a wealth of experience in international affairs that will be of tremendous value to our students," said James Levinsohn, director of the institute.
The graduate students will focus on globalisation and modern leadership.
The general was fired by President Barack Obama in June after comments made to Rolling Stone angered the White House. He was replaced with his boss, Gen David Petraeus.
In the article, Gen McChrystal's aides were quoted as calling an Obama adviser a "clown", and saying the president appeared intimidated at an early meeting with the general.
