Iran hangs two for involvement in vote unrest: report
TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran executed two members of an exiled opposition group on Monday who it said were involved in turmoil after the disputed 2009 presidential election, the official IRNA news agency reported.
It said Jafar Kazemi and Mohammadali Hajaghaie were members of the Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) and had filmed and distributed footage of huge opposition protests that erupted in Iran after the vote.
“Two members of the Monafeghin (hypocrites) group ... were hanged early today,” IRNA reported, citing a statement by the prosecutor’s office.
The report said the two men were “members of an active network” of MKO and were involved in post-election riots with the guidance of their leader in England. IRNA said the pair were hanged after an appeals court upheld their death sentences.
Iran executed two people last year in connection with the vote unrest and on charges including waging war against God, trying to overthrow the Islamic establishment and being members of armed opposition groups.
The vote, which was followed by huge opposition protests, plunged Iran into its deepest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and exposed divisions in the establishment.
The reformist opposition says the election was rigged to bring back President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The authorities deny the charge and have portrayed the protests as a foreign-backed bid to undermine the Islamic government system.
Thousands of people, including senior reformers, were detained after the election for fomenting unrest. Most of them have since been freed, but more than 80 people have been jailed for up to 15 years and five have been sentenced to death.
Separately on Monday, six Iranians were hanged on different charges, including rape and murder, Iranian media reported.
