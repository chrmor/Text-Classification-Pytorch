Top ISIS leaders killed in Iraqi air strike, not Baghdadi
Several top Islamic State leaders were killed in an air strike but the group’s top commander, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, did not appear to be among them, according to multiple reports.
The Iraqi military announced that its air force hit a convoy carrying the reclusive leader as it moved to a meeting in Karbala, in Iraq's western Anbar province. The city is about three miles from the border with Syria.
The statement indicated Baghdad’s fate and whereabouts are not known.
Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed leader of an ISIS controlled caliphate in Iraq and Syria, rarely makes public appearances.
Iraqi forces have bragged about injuring or killing the bloodthirsty terrorist in the past. But those claims were later debunked by a voice recording in which Baghdadi urged Muslims to join ISIS.
The latest Iraqi air force statement said the group had bombed his convoy “while he was heading to Karabla to attend a meeting with [ISIS] commanders.”
Baghdadi grabbed headlines when a 21-minute video of a surprise sermon he gave in Mosul surfaced in July 2014. It was one of the few times the terrorist was seen in public.
The shadowy leader has been on the U.S. radar for almost a decade — and even spent time in a U.S. jail.
In 2011, U.S. officials posted a $10 million bounty for assistance leading to his arrest.
Six years earlier, Baghdadi was arrested by U.S. forces and put in an American-run detention facility in Iraq, Camp Bucca. The military did not believe he was a major threat and let him go when the camp closed in 2009.
