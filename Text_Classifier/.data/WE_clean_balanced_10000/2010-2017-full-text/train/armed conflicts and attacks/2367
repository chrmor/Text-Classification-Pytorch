Taliban Suicide Bomb Near Airport Kills Civilian, Injures 13
The head of Kabul police, Abdul Rahman Rahimi, said one person had been killed and 13 wounded, including three women. He said the aim of the attack in an overwhelmingly civilian area had been to create fear among Afghans.
"Enemies of humanity detonated a suicide car bomb in front of a madrassa where children were learning the Koran and Islamic studies. It shows that they are enemies of mosques, God and the Koran," he said.
A minibus was also destroyed by the explosion, which shattered the windows of nearby shops and spread debris across the street.
