Britain to wade into Myanmar's modernisation
Britain will offer Myanmar military training and official assistance to tackle its internal conflicts when President Thein Sein meets David Cameron in London on Monday.
Hugo Swire, the Foreign Office minister of state, said that Britain was determined to take a leading role in helping Myanmar to develop a more democratic system and resolve ethnic tensions.
In particular, the Foreign Office has sought to use its historic experience in the former colony, then known as Burma, to defuse tensions between the military-backed government and Rohingya Muslims. Clashes between the Rohingya and Buddhist radicals with close links to the government have left hundreds dead over the past year, while more than 140,000 people remain displaced across Rakhine state.
"We don't underestimate how much needs to be done in Burma but it is critical we are engaged in helping the Burmese undertake changes," Mr Swire said.
"The right way to proceed is to have the Burmese here and to send our officials over there to help them through their difficulties."
