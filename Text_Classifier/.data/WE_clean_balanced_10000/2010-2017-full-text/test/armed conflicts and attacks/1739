Palestinians set Josephs Tomb on fire
Unrest rattled the West Bank city of Nablus Sunday following the shootingof Breslov Hassidim visiting the Palestinian-controlled Joseph's Tomb in the city.
Twenty-four year old Ben-Yosef Livnat, a father of four from Jerusalem – and Minister Limor Livnat's nephew – was killed , and five others were wounded.
Palestinian sources reported local Palestinian youths gathered around the Tomb's compound shortly after the incident and set it on fire.
A group of Palestinian youngsters rolled burning tires into the Tomb's plaza, which was renovated only a few months ago.
A Palestinian source said black smoke towered over the gravesite, adding the sight was "reminiscent of the days of the Second Indifada."
Palestinian fire fighters and police forces were called to the scene. No substantial damage was caused to the compound.
Palestinian security forces are now heavily deployed in the area to maintain order.
