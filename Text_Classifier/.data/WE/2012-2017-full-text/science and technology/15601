Prof. Daphna Joel received her Ph.D. in psychology in Tel-Aviv University in 1998, and joined the faculty of TAU, after receiving the Alon fellowship for young Israeli scientists. Prof. Joel is presently the Chair of the PhD Committee at the School of Psychological Sciences and a member of the Sagol School of Neuroscience.
Prof. Joel studied the involvement of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in normal and abnormal behavior, using mainly animal models of psychopathology. More recently Prof. Joel has expanded her work to research questions related to brain, sex and gender. Ongoing studies attempt to characterize the relations between sex and brain structure and function. Other studies focus on the perception of gender identity and on sexual practices.
