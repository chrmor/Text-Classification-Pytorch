With the 6-1 victory, the Yankees swept the series, 3-0, and advanced to their second-straight American League Championship Series and ninth in 14 seasons. They will play the winner of the Rays-Rangers series with Game 1 scheduled for next Friday.
The Yankees jumped out to an early 1-0 lead in the second inning when Jorge Posada drove home Robinson Cano, who had tripled. They didn’t let up on Minnesota starter Brian Duensing, who was chased from the game in the fourth inning.
The key blow for the Yankees was a two-run home run from Marcus Thames in the fourth that gave the Yankees a 4-0 lead.
