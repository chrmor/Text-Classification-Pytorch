JAKARTA: Eighteen people on board a mini bus, including the driver, were killed in an accident at a rail crossing in North Jakarta Sunday morning (Dec 6).
A collision between a commuter train and a minibus on a level crossing in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Sunday killed at least 18 people and injured several others.
"There were 24 people inside the minibus, 16 people died including the driver, the rest are still being treated at hospitals," Jakarta police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal told AFP.
The transport ministry spokesman J.A. Barata told AFP that a team from the ministry and the National Transportation Safety Committee would be deployed to investigate the cause of the crash, the spokesman added.
Eva Chairunisa, a spokeswoman for train operator Kereta Commuter Line, said the accident happened shortly before 9am when a train slammed into a packed minibus as it crossed a railway line in the north of the city.
The bus drove past a closed gate at the level crossing before it was hit, she said. "No one on the train was hurt in the accident but several bus passengers died," she told AFP earlier in the afternoon.
Chairunisa said the train driver followed standard procedures and sounded the horn to warn the bus before the accident happened. The line was partially closed following the collision.
Transport accidents are common in Jakarta, where roads are heavily congested and buses and trains are often old and badly maintained. In 2013 seven people were killed and scores more injured when a commuter train collided with a fuel tanker at a level crossing in Jakarta and burst into flames.
