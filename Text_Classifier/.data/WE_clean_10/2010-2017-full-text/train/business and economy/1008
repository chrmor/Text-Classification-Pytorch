Japan logs first trade deficit in almost two years
Japan posted its first trade deficit in almost two years last month, officials said Wednesday, amid rising commodity prices and weak demand for its exports ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday.
The finance ministry said exports, a key driver of Japan's economy, rose just 1.4 percent in January -- the 14th consecutive month of growth, but a well off the 13 percent on-year surge in December.
That came as instability in the Middle East and North Africa pushed the price of oil and other commodities up amid concerns supplies could be cut, sending resource-poor Japan's import bill up 12.4 percent.
And analysts warned that with commodity prices looking set rise further Japan could see its cost of imports continue to grow.
The trade deficit for export-dependent Japan, which is struggling to revive its sagging economy, stood at 471.42 billion yen ($5.7 billion), compared with forecasts for a 49.6 billion yen surplus.
"Exports to China grew by only one percent in January, compared with 20.1 percent in December," said a finance ministry official.
