KARACHI: A pre-dawn fire at Karachi’s Regent Plaza hotel on Monday killed at least 11 people and wounded 75 others.
“We have received 11 dead bodies and 75 injured, four women were among the dead,” Seemin Jamali, a doctor at Karachi’s Jinnah hospital said.
Most of the victims had suffered from smoke inhalation or suffocated, Jamali said, adding that the deceased include three foreigners.
Some people were injured after jumping from windows to escape the blaze.
SSP Saqib Memon said the cause of the fire was not clear and an investigation had been launched.
Memon confirmed the death toll and said it took three hours for the fire to be brought under control.
Located at Shara-e-Faisal, the hotel had foreign, as well as local guests who were affected by the fire. Three players of the domestic cricket team were also injured during their escape from the hotel.
Yassim Murtaza of UBL’s team broke his ankle, while Karamat Ali received injuries to his hand from broken glass, the team’s sources confirmed. The scheduled match with Habib Bank will therefore not go ahead today.
The fire injured 16 Pakistan International Airlines cabin crew members belonging to Islamabad and Peshawar, a statement issued by PIA said.
“While most of the cabin crew members were discharged after receiving necessary first aid, some are undergoing treatment.”
