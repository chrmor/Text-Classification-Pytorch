14 killed in operation vs Abu Sayyaf in Sulu
ZAMBOANGA CITY—At least 14 people were killed—10 of them Abu Sayyaf bandits—during a heavy clash amid an intensified anti-Abu Sayyaf operation in Patikul, Sulu, on Friday.
Major Filemon Tan Jr., the spokesperson of the Western Mindanao Command, said four soldiers were slain while nine other soldiers had been wounded in the encounter.
The Abu Sayyaf suffered undetermined number of injuries, he added.
Tan said out of the 10 slain bandits, only three bodies had been recovered so far.
The clash ensued when operating troops under the 35th Infantry Battalion stumbled on a large group of about 150 bandits under Radullan Sahiron in Sitio Dyundangan in Barangay Buhanginan, Tan reported.
He said the firefight lasted for almost 45 minutes and stopped only when the Abu Sayyaf withdrew.
Tan said soldiers continue to pursue the group while support units fire 105-millimeter Howitzers./rga
