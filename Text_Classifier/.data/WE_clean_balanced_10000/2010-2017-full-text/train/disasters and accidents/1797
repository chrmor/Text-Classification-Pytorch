2 firefighters killed, 2 hurt in Texas lodge fire
Two Texas fire lieutenants have died of burns after battling a lodge hall fire.
A spokeswoman for the Central Texas city of Bryan confirmed the deaths of Gregory Pickard and Eric Wallace. Mary Stratta says Pickard died Saturday in a Galveston hospital and Wallace at the scene.
The firefighters entered the burning Knights of Columbus hall in Bryan about midnight Friday. Stratta says they didn't emerge when ordered to evacuate.
She says two other firefighters were taken to the hospital in Galveston to be treated for burns. Ricky Mantey Jr. and Mitchel Moran are both in serious but stable condition.
