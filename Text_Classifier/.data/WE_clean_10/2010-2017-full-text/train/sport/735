Cheers as 97% yes vote gives Tinkler the Knights
MULTIMILLIONAIRE Nathan Tinkler owns the Knights after a staggering 97 per cent of the NRL club's members voted in favour of the racing and mining baron's privatisation proposal at an extraordinary general meeting at Newcastle Entertainment Centre last night.
Tinkler required only a 75 per cent majority of members to agree to two constitutional amendments clearing the way for him to take control of Newcastle's NRL club, which until last night's history-making ballot had been a membership-based, community-owned entity from the time it was founded in 1988.
Emerging after an hour-long ballot, Knights chairman Rob Tew announced that the two special motions had been carried, 97 per cent for to 3 per cent against, prompting rapturous applause, a standing ovation from some members, and a spontaneous chant of ''New-cas-tle, New-cas-tle, New-cas-tle''.
''It is a resounding successful proposal for the Tinkler Sports Group,'' Tew said. ''In order to succeed the Tinkler Sports Group needed 75 per cent plus and as you can see they've clearly done that. From the outset, it's been the board's imperative to get the best deal for this club and this vote tonight is an historic vote in the history of this club â€¦ At 97 to three on both resolutions, we continue to be a united club.''
