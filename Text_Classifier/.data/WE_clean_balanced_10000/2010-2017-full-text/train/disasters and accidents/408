Prince William arrives in Christchurch
Prince William has touched down in quake-ravaged Christchurch to a rapturous round of applause, taking time out to hold a baby as he passed through the airport.
As he walked through the airport, one woman yelled out "thank you so much for coming to Christchurch".
Michelle Watkins said: "I just saw the prince; he looked at me too. I'm shaking, he's so beautiful."
A little boy of about six yelled out "I love Prince William" as he walked past.
The prince also stopped briefly to hold a woman's baby. He was met by Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker.
