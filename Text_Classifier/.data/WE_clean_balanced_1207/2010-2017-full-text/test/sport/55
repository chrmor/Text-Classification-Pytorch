Teen Hyo-Joo Kim beats Karrie Webb by 1 to win Evian Championship
EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France -- Having already made major history with the lowest-ever round, South Korean teenager Hyo-Joo Kim enhanced her reputation by beating Australian veteran Karrie Webb by one shot on Sunday to win the Evian Championship and become the third youngest major winner at 19 years, 2 months.
Kim trailed the 39-year-old Webb by one shot heading into the final hole. But she turned the tables with a birdie from 12 feet out, and Webb then missed a chance to force a playoff when a difficult attempt for par from the same distance drifted left of the hole.
Kim led Webb by one shot overnight and they both posted 3-under rounds of 68 in perfect conditions, with no clouds or wind to disrupt them.
"I feel very happy, like a bird," Kim said through a translator. "I want to fly in the sky."
She's been flying since her record-breaking 61 in Thursday's first round, the lowest in men's and women's majors. She finished on 11-under 273 overall.
Kim had played here before, tying for fourth in 2012 -- the final year before Evian became the fifth major.
Webb, meanwhile, was looking to win her eighth career major and first since Kraft Nabisco in 2006.
"I believe in fate a little bit, and I wasn't meant to win," Webb said. "I hit a lot of good putts this week. Probably the one on the last was the poorest I hit all week."
Only Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson -- both from the U.S. -- have won majors at a younger age than Kim, who is studying physical education in Seoul.
She seemed to take it all in her stride.
When Webb's putt rolled wide, Kim removed her glasses slowly and then walked up to give Webb a small hug.
Webb finished ahead of three other South Koreans. Ha-Na Jang and Mi-Jung Hur were tied for third at 9 under, with Na-Yeon Choi in fifth another shot back. Defending champion Suzann Pettersen of Norway was one behind her.
Choi birdied 12 and 14 to keep the pressure on, but the U.S. Women's Open champion from 2012 dropped back when she bogeyed the 16th, and Webb was level with Kim with three to play.
The shot of the day belonged to Japan's Mika Miyazato: a hole in one on the 16th.
Meanwhile, Michelle Wie, who pulled out during the first round because of a recurrence of her right index finger injury, won the inaugural Rolex Annika Major award.
Named after retired Swedish great Annika Sorenstam, it honors the player with the best overall record in the five majors. Wie won the U.S. Women's Open and finished second at the Kraft Nabisco.
"I am extremely proud of myself," said Wie, who hopes to be back playing in China next month.
Webb looked certain to clinch her 42nd LPGA title with two holes to play.
Kim's approach on the 16th almost rolled into the water, leaving her a difficult uphill par putt from the fringe, which she missed as Webb took the lead with a par from 4 feet.
Webb missed a long birdie chance on the 17th and was way short, before a par from six feet.
But that composure left her on the last, when her second shot went slightly off the green.
About 30 feet from the pin, Webb chose to chip and almost made an improbable birdie as the ball rolled just past the hole, but then carried on downhill for about 12 feet.
"I don't know what hit me actually," Webb said. "Just probably a rush of adrenaline with the belly wedge."
Kim punched the air after making her birdie.
"If I missed this hole, I would lose," she said. "I was very nervous."
"The shot is definitely very mature," Webb said. "I left the foot off the pedal a little bit. But she still had to make it."
Wie, who made her professional debut when she was 15, concurred.
"You can't put a blanket for everyone and say that now 19 winning a major is normal. It's not normal," she said. "It's pretty incredible what she did. It's pretty incredible what Morgan did winning at 18."
