AA flights halted in Chicago, Dallas due to computer glitch
DALLAS, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- All flights operated by American Airlines were put to a stop at three of the nation's busiest airports Thursday -- including Chicago's O'Hare -- due to a computer glitch that created connectivity problems, officials said.
The airline issued the ground stop Thursday morning after the extent of the computer problem was discovered. The airline responded by issuing the stop at about 11 a.m. CDT, meaning no flights could depart or land.
The ground stop affected all American flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago's O'Hare and Miami International Airport -- all three of which are major hubs for the carrier.
The order lasted for about 90 minutes, the airline said.
"We have resolved connectivity issues that led to a ground stop today at our Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami hubs," American Airlines spokesman Casey Norton said. "We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to get our customers on their way as soon as possible."
All three airports are among the nation's busiest.
American Airlines received assistance from the Federal Aviation Administration to fix the problem, officials said.
