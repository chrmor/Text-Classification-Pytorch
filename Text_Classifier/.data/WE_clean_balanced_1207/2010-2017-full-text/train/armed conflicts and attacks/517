US soldier killed in 'green-on-blue' Afghanistan attack
A US Nato soldier in Afghanistan has been killed by two gunmen wearing Afghan army uniform, officials say.
Two other American soldiers were wounded in the incident in eastern Afghanistan, a US official told the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
It is the latest in a series of so-called "green-on-blue" attacks, where men wearing Afghan army uniforms turn their guns on coalition troops.
At least nine civilians were killed in a separate bomb blast near Kabul.
The remote-controlled device hit a minibus in Paghman district on Tuesday. Reports say the intended target could have been a bus carrying Afghan soldiers that had passed moments before.
A man suspected of placing the bomb was arrested after villagers gave a chase, according to AP.
Another attack on a Nato base in Pule Alam, Logar province, injured 17 Afghan civilians and three Nato soldiers, officials said.
A senior Afghan intelligence official in Logar province blamed the Haqqani network for the Nato base attack.
The Haqqani network is closely allied to the Taliban and reportedly based in Pakistan.
It has been blamed for several high-profile attacks against Western, Indian and government targets in Afghanistan.
In other developments, officials in Paris have said that one French soldier has been killed and another wounded in a firefight with insurgents in Kapisa province.
The wounded soldier is expected to survive, a statement from the prime minister's office said.
Foreign troops are preparing to hand full responsibility for security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014.
France plans to have removed its troops from the country by the end of this year.
