Hurricane Jova Moves Inland Near Mexico Resort of Manzanillo
Hurricane Jova came ashore near Mexico’s Pacific resort of Manzanillo today, lashing coastal communities with 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour winds and heavy rainfall, the National Hurricane Center said.
The storm, which pummeled the region with high surf as well, was moving north at 9 mph and was now about 30 miles south-southeast of Puerto Vallarta, the center said today in a 5 a.m. PDT advisory.
A “dangerous storm surge” will bring life-threatening waves and coastal flooding to the area while weakening over land, the Miami-based center said. Rainfall totals may reach as much as 20 inches in Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states.
The state government of Jalisco suspended classes until tomorrow in 1,030 schools and evacuated 500 people from "high-risk areas," according to a statement on its website. The storm isn’t likely to affect the opening ceremony of the Pan American Games, scheduled for Oct. 14 in Guadalajara, it said.
In neighboring Nayarit state, Governor Roberto Sandoval yesterday canceled all classes in coastal municipalities and opened 331 shelters, according to the state government website.
West of Jova and at sea, Tropical Storm Irwin regained strength with winds of 40 mph. Irwin is about 555 miles from the southern tip of Baja California. It is forecast to weaken again to a tropical depression and dissipate over the Pacific.
The NHC is also monitoring a tropical depression bearing 35 mph winds that formed just south of Mexico’s Gulf of Tehuantepec near the Guatemala border that may become a tropical storm today and move inland with heavy rains tonight.
