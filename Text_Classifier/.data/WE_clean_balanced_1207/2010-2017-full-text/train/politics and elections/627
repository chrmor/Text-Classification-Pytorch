Daryl Hannah arrested
Actress Daryl Hannah has been arrested in front of the White House along with other environmental protesters who oppose a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the US Gulf Coast.
The sit-in on Tuesday involved dozens protesting the Keystone XL pipeline. It would go through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas to refineries in Houston and Port Arthur, Texas.
Before she was arrested, Hannah said the protesters want to be free from dependence on fossil fuels. The group calls for clean energy investments instead.
Hannah says they hope President Barack Obama will not bow to oil lobbyists.
