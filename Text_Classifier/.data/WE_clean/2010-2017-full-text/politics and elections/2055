Oil drilling ban lifted in Gulf of Mexico
The Obama administration has lifted a six-month moratorium on deep water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
The ban, implemented after the BP oil spill, had been scheduled to expire on 30 November, but White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said new rules imposed after the spill had reduced the risk of a similar disaster.
