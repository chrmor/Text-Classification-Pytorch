British tourist found dead on Kashmir houseboat
A 24-year-old British tourist was found dead early Saturday in a houseboat in Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.
Police arrested a Dutch tourist who was staying in the houseboat in a room next to the victim.
Before being apprehended, the Dutch tourist tried to flee but was captured in a town south of Srinagar.
"While fleeing, the Dutch tourist left behind his belongings and took only his passport along," said Abdul Gani Mir, Kashmir's inspector general of police.
The woman's door was broken and police suspect that she may have been raped before her murder, the inspector general said.
An autopsy and medical examination will determine if the victim was raped.
