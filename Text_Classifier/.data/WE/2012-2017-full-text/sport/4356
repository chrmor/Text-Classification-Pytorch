NHL announces cancellation of 2012-13 regular-season schedule through January 14
NEW YORK -- The National Hockey League announced today the cancellation of the 2012-13 regular-season schedule through January 14. The cancellations are necessary due to the absence of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NHL Players' Association and the NHL.
A total of 625 regular-season games—50.8 percent of the season—were scheduled for October 11 through January 14.
