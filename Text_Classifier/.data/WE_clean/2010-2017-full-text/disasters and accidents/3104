On the roads, motorists were warned to stay at home as the hazards of snow and ice intensified yet again across much of the country, with temperatures struggling to get above zero.

Staff at Edinburgh airport said they hoped to reopen the runway by midday, while London City, Southampton, Durham Tees Valley and Robin Hood airports were also closed on Thursday morning.
