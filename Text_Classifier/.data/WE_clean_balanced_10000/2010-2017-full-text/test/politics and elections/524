Minnesota blame game ramps up
Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said GOP legislative leaders are being held hostage by the tea party while Republicans accused the governor of engaging in “a class warfare classic” Friday as the two sides blamed each other for their collective failure to reach a budget deal, closing state government functions and leaving some 23,000 employees out of work.
Gov. Dayton, who had been the target of attacks all day by GOP leaders of the state house and senate, fired back in a late-afternoon interview on Minnesota Public Radio. In an echo of the bickering taking place in Washington, he blamed newly-elected tea party-backed Republicans who seized control of the state legislature last fall.
“We were making our best efforts,” Dayton said. “They’re really hemmed in by their caucuses. The two caucuses in the Republican ranks are so dominated by tea party ideologues. Not a penny more, their way … their budget, not a penny more. Well, I have a different view, and we were both elected, so in a democracy you have govern by coming to a reasonable, balanced compromise, and they were just unwilling to do that and that left their leaders unable to take the leadership that was necessary.”
The governor also said he will hold no new talks with Republicans until at least Tuesday, leaving state parks, social services and other functions closed.
Dayton’s remarks continue the state’s furious blame game, which began late Thursday night when the two sides were unable to reach a biennial budget deal before a midnight deadline.
The senate majority leader, Republican Amy Koch, ripped Dayton for refusing to drop his plan to slap an income tax increase on people who earn more than $1 million annually, while Democrats charged that the GOP was holding state residents hostage to its demands for social policy changes, including new restrictions on abortion.
“We made an offer to the governor on more revenue yesterday morning,” Koch said during a morning interview on Minnesota Public Radio. “He countered with an offer that we thought we could work with. … The governor, very honestly, walked away then. He withdrew the offer.”
Koch, who with house Speaker Kurt Zellers led a 2010 GOP takeover of the state Legislature, couched opposition to tax increases on the wealthy in the same terms Republicans in Washington use.
“It’s a class warfare classic, 1970s, 1980s philosophy,” Koch added. “It’s about what we can afford. We cannot afford the government we’ve got.”
And Zellers invoked New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s refusal to increase taxes on millioniares as a reason that Dayton, a Democrat, should do the same.
No new talks are scheduled, although Zellers told WCCO he remains “ready, willing and able to negotiate.”
And Minnesota Democratic party chairman Ken Martin took to MSNBC to affix the blame for the shutdown on the state’s previous governor, Tim Pawlenty, who is seeking the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.
“The last eight years of reckless policies of Tim Pawlenty are what got us into this mess in the first place,” Martin said.
Of Pawlenty’s Thursday night press conference at which he said a long state government shutdown may be a good thing, Martin said: “It’s like a guy running through a crowded theater yelling ‘Fire! Fire!’ and in fact he’s the one who set the place on fire to begin with.”
Minnesota House Democratic leader Paul Thissen told the public radio station that the GOP offer to make a budget deal came with unacceptable strings attached — including significant restrictions to abortion.
