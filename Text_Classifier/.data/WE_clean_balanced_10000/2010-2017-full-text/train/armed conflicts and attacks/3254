Salah Abdeslam's brother denies involvement in Paris attacks and says he has no idea where his brother is
Mohamed Abdeslam, the brother of two suspects accused of taking part in the Paris attacks, has insisted he is not "in the slightest way" connected to the killings and said he has no idea of the whereabouts of his brother Salah, who is currently the focus of an international manhunt.
Speaking to reporters in the Molenbeek area of Brussels, he said: "I was accused of committing an act of terrorism... but I have not in the slightest way been connected to the operation in Paris."
"I have worked for the local council for 10 years and I've never had a problem with anyone... my parents are completely shocked by the tragedy."
"My two brothers are normal and I have never noticed anything strange."
His brother Brahim died on Friday after blowing himself up outside a caf√© in Paris' 11th arrodissement, wounding one person in the process.
His other brother, 26-year-old Salah, is currently 'France's most wanted man', and was found to be the renter of a Volkswagen Polo that was parked outside the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people were killed.
He was stopped by police in a car near the Belgian border on Saturday morning, but was later released after brief police checks. He has not been seen since.
Mohamed Abdeslam said he did not know where his brother was.
"My brother Salah still has not been heard from, perhaps he just isn't daring to show himself to the authorities," he said.
