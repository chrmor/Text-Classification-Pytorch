The working group is intended to develop a "new level of relations between the military departments of both countries," the statement said.
According to the document, the working group will address the following issues: armed forces reform and transformation, priorities of defense policy and national security, transparency and confidence-building measures furthering the improvement of mutual understanding, regional and global security, new challenges and threats, and cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
Gates and Serdyukov, who will co-chair the group, intend to meet at least once a year, the statement said.
