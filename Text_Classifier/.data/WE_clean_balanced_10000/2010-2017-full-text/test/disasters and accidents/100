last week's building collapse The death toll from last week's building collapse in southern India has risen to 61, area administrator K. Baskaran said Friday.
The 11-story building under construction in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, toppled over during heavy rains June 28. Emergency crews furiously dug through the rubble for people thought to be missing, police said.
At least 21 other people survived with injuries, Baskaran said. They included two workers who were pulled out alive on Monday, two days after the incident, police said.
Previously, CNN reported the death toll was at 32 on Tuesday.
Also Saturday, at least 10 people were killed when a rundown four-story building in New Delhi collapsed.
Building collapses in India are an all-too-common occurrence and have killed hundreds of people over the past several years.
