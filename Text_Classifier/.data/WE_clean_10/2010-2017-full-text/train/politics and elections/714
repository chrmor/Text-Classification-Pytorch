Tas govt reeling but premier stands firm
Tasmania's Labor minority government is reeling from the shock loss of two senior ministers but Premier Lara Giddings rejects claims it's in crisis.
Former premier David Bartlett announced he was quitting politics just days after education, children and police minister Lin Thorp lost her upper house seat, forcing a major cabinet reshuffle.
"It's no secret that this week has been a terrible week, and I'm not going to try to gloss over it," Ms Giddings told reporters in Hobart.
Ms Giddings said her government, which relies on the state's five Greens MPs to remain in power, was unified and strong.
Opposition Leader Will Hodgman said the government was in crisis at a time when the state was confronting an economic and budget crisis.
"There are many people increasingly saying when will there be another election, has this government got a mandate to govern, that it bears no resemblance to the government that was formed just a year ago," he said.
