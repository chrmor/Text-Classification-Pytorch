The Latest: Greek police come under fire as they arrest suspected migrant-smugglers
(AP) — The latest as tens of thousands of people flood into Europe in search of a new life. All times local. Greek police say they came under fire on the country’s northeastern border with Turkey during the arrest of two suspected migrant-smugglers who had just ferried 22 people across the Evros river that runs along the Greek-Turkish border. Police said late Wednesday that a border patrol intercepted two inflatable dinghies that had been rowed across the river from the Turkish side late Tuesday night with 24 people on board, including seven children. All were Syrians except for one Iraqi. The patrol arrested two Syrian men aged 31 and 44 as suspected smugglers. During the arrest, police said, the patrol and the group of refugees came under fire from a suspected smuggler still on the Turkish side of the border, who fired about 30 shots. The Greek patrol fired in the air, and no injuries were reported. ___ 1:35 p.m. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s special representative on migration says the numbers of Syrian refugees trying to reach Europe shows no sign of abating despite the onset of winter. Peter Sutherland acknowledged the enormity of the problem in a BBC interview, describing the influx as having no solution now or in the foreseeable future. He says the war in Syria “is driving people to desperation in terms of leaving and it will continue in its effects,” and that Europe has no choice morally and legally but to address it. “This is now a global responsibility, but it is a particular European responsibility,” he said. “And in Europe we can’t say simply that those who are the closest to the problem, and therefore receive most of the migrants, have to handle it themselves.” ___ 1:15 p.m. German authorities say 181,000 asylum-seekers entered the country in October, 17,000 more than September as the flow continued to increase despite worsening weather conditions
