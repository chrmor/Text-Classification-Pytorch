Iraq hits 'jihadist convoy' in Syria
Iraqi military helicopters have destroyed a convoy of fuel tankers inside Syrian territory, Baghdad says.
The convoy was heading towards the border and was due to supply jihadi militants in Iraq's Anbar province, according to the Interior Ministry.
It is believed to be the first time Iraq has said it has carried out an attack inside Syria.
Al-Qaeda linked group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) fights the governments in Syria and Iraq.
Isis has recently created a safe passage from Anbar to the north Syrian city of Aleppo, says BBC Arabic's Murad Batal Shishani.
He says the strip of territory grants the militants a smooth flow of weapons, logistics and manpower between both countries.
However, most of Syria's other rebels oppose Isis, and it has reportedly been forced to retreat after clashes with other armed groups.
Our correspondent says it seems Iraq now wants to increase the pressure on the group by hitting its supply routes.
The Interior Ministry's Brigadier General Saad Maan said eight lorries were hit in the raid near al-Bukamal, and eight people had been killed.
Isis grew out of the former Islamic State of Iraq, a jihadist militant umbrella group that included al-Qaeda in Iraq.
