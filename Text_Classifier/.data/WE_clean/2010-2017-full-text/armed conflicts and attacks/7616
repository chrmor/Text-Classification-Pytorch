Misurata residents celebrate ICC warrants
Libyans living in rebel-held Misurata have taken to the streets to celebrate the issuing of arrest warrants for Muammar Gaddafi, his son and his spy chief.
Judges at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands say they have grounds to believe Gaddafi has committed crimes against humanity. A Misurata resident told Al Jazeera: "It's the day we have all been waiting for!" Another resident said: "The courts will catch [Gaddafi]; otherwise we the people, our revolutionaries, will catch him." Al Jazeera's Sue Turton has this report.
