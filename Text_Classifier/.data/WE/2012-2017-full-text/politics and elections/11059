New Zealand has won one of five two-year seats on the United Nations Security Council
New Zealand, Malaysia, Angola, Spain and Venezuela have won seats on the United Nations Security Council for two years from January 1, 2015.
They are the newest members to the top UN body, which has the power to impose sanctions and authorise the use of force.
The 193-member UN General Assembly elected Venezuela with 181 votes, Malaysia with 187 votes and Angola with 190 votes.
All three countries campaigned unopposed for their seats after being chosen as the candidates for their respective regional groups, but still needed to win the votes of two-thirds of the General Assembly to secure their spots.
The only contest was between New Zealand, Spain and Turkey for two seats given to the Western European and others group.
New Zealand won a seat during the first round of voting with 145 votes. A run-off vote saw Spain roundly defeat Turkey for the seat.
Venezuela last tried to join the 15-member council in 2006, but failed to win the required two-thirds support of the General Assembly during dozens of rounds of voting after the United States successfully campaigned against its bid.
Washington did not stand in the way of Venezuela's bid this time.
Ten countries abstained in the secret General Assembly ballot to elect Venezuela.
"The Latin American and Caribbean countries have done a great disservice to the cause of international peace as well as helping a rogue military-civilian dictatorship gain a world stage," said Venezuelan opposition figure Diego Aria, who was the country's UN ambassador in the early 1990s.
