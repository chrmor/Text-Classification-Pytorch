Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country has seized a Syrian-flagged ship possibly carrying weapons to Syria.
Turkish media reported Mr. Erdogan told journalists in New York Friday that Turkey will intercept and seize any type of arms shipment bound for Syria. He said that applies to shipments by land, sea and air.
He did not give specific information about the Syrian ship that was seized, its cargo or when or where it was stopped.
Earlier this week, Mr. Erdogan said Turkey has suspended talks with Syria and is considering imposing sanctions against the neighboring country for its crackdown on anti-government protesters. At least 11 people were killed by Syrian security forces on Friday.
The European Union also slapped new sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad's government on Friday including a ban on oil investments and the delivery of bank notes to the country's central bank.
