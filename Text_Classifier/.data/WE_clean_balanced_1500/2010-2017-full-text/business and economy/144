Angola grounds Boeing 777 planes
Angola's national airline has grounded its fleet of three Boeing 777 aircraft after one of the planes was forced to make an emergency landing.
A TAAG spokesman said a flight from Luanda to Dubai had to turn back after take-off because of engine trouble.
Another of the planes experienced similar trouble on take-off two weeks ago at Lisbon in Portugal.
TAAG was only recently granted permission to fly its 777s to European Union countries.
It had been been banned in 2007 over safety concerns.
"In the face of two similar incidents in the space of 17 days, TAAG has decided to suspend all flights for its Boeing 777-200ER fleet for the sake of caution and international security," TAAG spokesman Rui Carreira told Angolan state radio station RNA.
He said TAAG would demand a report from the manufacturers of the engine and the plane who would carry out an investigation to determine the causes.
