Los Angeles and New York Differ in Their Responses to a Terrorism Threat
LOS ANGELES — The nation’s two largest school systems confronted threats of a terrorist attack on Tuesday and reacted in sharply different ways: New York City reviewed the warning and dismissed it as a hoax, but officials here abruptly shut down all public schools, upending the lives of parents, students and teachers.
The emailed threats to school officials on both coasts — which spoke of teams of jihadists using guns, bombs and nerve gas to attack public schools — were largely identical in their wording, and both had been routed through a server in Frankfurt, apparently by the same person, officials said.
The Los Angeles schools chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, reviewed the threat, which came in to several school board members around 10 p.m. on Monday, with police officials here early Tuesday before deciding to send out an alert closing nearly 1,100 schools and asking parents to keep the district’s 640,000 children home. “I as superintendent am not going to take a chance with the life of a student,” he said at a 7 a.m. news conference.
In New York, the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, reviewed the New York version of the threat and decided it was “a hoax.” Later on Tuesday, officials said that they believed that the email in Los Angeles was also most likely a hoax and that schools will reopen Wednesday.
