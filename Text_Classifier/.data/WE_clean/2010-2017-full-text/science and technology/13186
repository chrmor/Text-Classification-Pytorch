Another Rover Bound for Mars in 2020
NASA will launch its next robotic rover to Mars in the summer of 2020, agency officials announced on Tuesday. The $1.5 billion rover would largely reuse the same design as the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in August. This is the last piece in a revamped program that NASA put together after withdrawing from collaborations with the European Space Agency to launch two Mars missions in 2016 and 2018 because of budget constraints. NASA has since announced plans to launch a lander in 2016 that will study Mars’ interior by listening to seismic waves rumbling through the ground. On Tuesday, NASA also announced that it would again participate in the Europeans’ 2016 and 2018 missions, but on a more limited scale.
