Japan Plans to Buy Islands  in Dispute
Discussions at APEC summit of Asian-Pacific leaders featured Europe's debt crisis and the environment during meetings in Vladivostok. As the WSJ's Brian Spegele explains, territorial disputes around the region were left off the agenda.
TOKYOâ€”The Japanese government made a formal decision to buy islands at the center of a dispute with China, a move to prevent the islands from ending up in Japanese nationalists' hands but one that provoked an angry response from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
Japan's chief government spokesman said it had agreed with the islands' private owners to purchase them, stressing it was in line with the government's policy of maintaining control of the islands in a "peaceful and stable" manner.
