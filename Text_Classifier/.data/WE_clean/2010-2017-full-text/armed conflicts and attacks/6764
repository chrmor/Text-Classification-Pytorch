Palestinians in Lebanon mourn dead protesters
Palestinian camps across Lebanon declared a day of mourning on Monday as the families of 10 people killed when Israeli troops opened fire on protesters at the border prepare to bury their dead.
"Today is a day of general strikes in the camps in mourning for the victims who were killed by the enemy," Fatah commander in Lebanon Munir Maqdah, based in the refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh, told AFP.
Funerals will be held Monday in the Palestinian refugee camps of al-Bass, Burj al-Shemali, Mieh Mieh and Ain al-Hilweh, all located in South Lebanon.
Maqdah said talks were underway for a "Martyrs' Friday" to honour the victims.
"This will not end here," he said. "We may hold a 'Martyrs' Friday' but what the program will entail has not been finalized and we are still holding talks with our comrades here and abroad."
The 1948 formation of Israel is known in Arabic as the "nakba," or "catastrophe".
Israeli troops shot dead 12 people on Sunday and wounded hundreds more as Palestinians marking the "nakba" marched on Israelâ€™s borders with Gaza as well as Lebanon and Syria. These regions are home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out in 1948.
The Lebanese army said that 10 of those killed were approaching a barbed wire fence at Lebanon's border with the Jewish state. More than 100 more were wounded when the crowd of thousands of refugees, who were throwing rocks at Israeli troops from the Lebanese town of Maroun al-Ras, came under fire.
