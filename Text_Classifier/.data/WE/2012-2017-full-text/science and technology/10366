Bubonic plague death in Yumen, China sparks quarantine
Beijing: China has sealed off parts of its northwestern city of Yumen after a resident died of bubonic plague last week, state media reported on Tuesday.
A 38-year-old victim was infected by a marmot, a wild rodent, and died on July 16. Several districts of the city of about 100,000 people in Gansu province were subsequently turned into special quarantine zones, Xinhua said.
It said 151 people who came into direct contact with the victim were also placed in quarantine. None have so far shown any signs of infection, the news agency said.
The city had set aside 1 million yuan ($171,000) for emergency vaccinations, the Jiuquan Daily, a local newspaper, said on Tuesday.
