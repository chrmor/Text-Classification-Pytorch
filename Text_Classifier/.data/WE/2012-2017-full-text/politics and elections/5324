Victoria's new Premier, Denis Napthine, was born March 6, 1952 in Geelong, Victoria, which means he became Premier on his 61st birthday.
He went to school at Winchelsea State School and Geelong's Chanel College, and studied veterinary science at university. In his 20s and early 30s he worked as a vet in Victoria's Department of Agriculture.
At 36 he was elected to Parliament. He was first elected to the seat of Portland. When that was abolished he won an overlapping seat, South-West Coast.
In Jeff Kennett's government he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, then Minister for Youth and Community Services.
After Mr Kennett lost the state election in October 1999, Dr Napthine became Victorian Opposition leader, and held on despite terrible opinion polls until August 2002.
He was defeated in a challenge by Robert Doyle â€“ Melbourne's current lord mayor - not long before the 2002 Victorian election. He came within 1 per cent of losing his seat in that election but increased his margin in 2006 and again in 2010.
Before becoming premier, he was Ted Baillieu's minister for Racing, Ports, Major Projects and Regional Cities.
He owns a race horse called Spin The Bottle with Federal Liberal MP Dan Tehan.
Dr Napthine and his wife Peggy are parents to three children, including an autistic son they fostered in the 1980s.
