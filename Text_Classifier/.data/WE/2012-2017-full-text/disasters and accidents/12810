Hundreds of Migrants Rescued Off Libyan Coast
Italian and French authorities said they have rescued more than 2,400 migrants Saturday after the boats they were on ran into trouble in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya.
Italy’s coastguard said some of the migrants were being taken to Lampedusa, an island off the coast of Italy, and would arrive Saturday evening. The country’s coastguard and navy have taken most of the migrants to Italian ports after about 13 search and rescue operations.
Also involved in the operation was a French vessel that is part of Triton — the European Union (EU) border protection program, which had its budget tripled after hundreds of migrants died two weeks ago after their boat capsized — and two commercial ships from Panama and Liberia, the coastguard said.
