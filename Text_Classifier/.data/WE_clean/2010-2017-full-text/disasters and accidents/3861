Brisbane is preparing for the full impact of its worst flooding in more than 100 years, with officials warning almost 20,000 homes in the city will be flooded by early tomorrow morning.
Thirty-five Brisbane suburbs and 3,000 homes in the nearby city of Ipswich are already submerged by rapildy rising floodwaters.
This morning the death toll from this week's flash flooding in the Lockyer Valley was revised up to 12 after search teams found two more bodies.
A huge tide of brown water is surging down the swollen Brisbane River as authorities continue to release water from the overloaded Wivenhoe Dam.
The crisis is expected to be at its worst about 4:00am tomorrow morning, when the flood peak in Brisbane is expected to touch 5.5 metres, slightly higher than the city's 1974 flood peak.
Houses and businesses in Ipswich's CBD are underwater and thousands of properties are being evacuated in Brisbane as entire streets are submerged.
Adding to the misery, more than 60,000 homes through the region are without power.
The number of people missing after flash flooding in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley was revised down this morning, with 67 people still unaccounted for.
But Premier Anna Bligh has warned the hopes of many will be crushed as search teams reach areas of the Lockyer Valley, where they are expecting to find bodies.
"This incident is not a tourist event. This is a natural disaster," she said this morning.
"If you are not going to be affected, reach out to a neighbour. Reach out to friends and family.
"The fact that this is peaking today does not mean we won't see very dangerous scenarios today," she added.
"Don't take any comfort from the fact that we have blue sky today."
Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson says no more bodies have been found in the Lockyer Valley this morning, but he expects the death toll to rise.
"Part of the difficulty of this is the conditions ... some of these homes have been demolished and we fear that some people have been swept from their homes," he said.
"So we'll need to do aerial searches in case they've been swept out to paddocks."
Commissioner Atkinson says there are grave fears for about 18 people who are still missing in the Lockyer Valley area.
Ipswich is being swamped this morning and the Bremer River there is now expected to peak today at 20.5 metres, slightly lower than the devastating 1974 floods.
Floodwaters have covered all but the tops of shops in the Ipswich CBD and the city's mayor Paul Pisasale expects about 4,000 homes to be flooded.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes last night, with around one-third of Ipswich expected to go under today.
In Brisbane, several low-lying suburbs as well as the CBD are already affected and the situation will worsen as the flood level is expected to reach 4.5 metres about 2:30pm (AEST).
The waters are then expected to peak again at approximately 5.5 metres about 4:00am AEST on Thursday morning and stay high until Saturday.
About 62,000 homes are without power in south-east Queensland and eight people have been rescued from a rooftop at Lowood west of Brisbane.
Power has been cut to Ipswich, while low-lying parts of Brisbane, including Oxley and the CBD, are now without electricity as Energex moves to protect the grid.
Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman this morning said new modelling helped generate a revised list of homes that will be affected.
"There are 19,700 residential properties across Brisbane where there's projected to be flooding across the whole block of land," he said.
"I can't tell you about the depth... there's a further 3,500 commercial premises across the city that will see flooding across the entire block of land as well."
Suburbs including Jindalee, South Bank, Toowong and Milton were flooded this morning and a total of 2,100 Brisbane streets will be affected by flooding under the new modelling.
Brisbane's bus system will start to be closed down from about 1:00pm today.
The South Brisbane train station is closed and there are no trains west of Darra.
The Port of Brisbane is closed.
One resident says many homes in Haldane Street in Graceville are under water, including his own.
"I went to check on my property because we slept in our car last night, and as we were there my mailbox disappeared under water, so it's actually rising quite quickly," he said.
Council says more than 6,500 people will need to housed in evacuation centres at the RNA Showgrounds and QEII Stadium.
Apart from inner-city residents, there are few people in the centre of Brisbane and it is uncharacteristically empty and silent.
Supermarkets were open last night but shelves that stock fruit, vegetables, bread and milk were largely empty.
More than 1,200 people spent the night at an evacuation centre in Ipswich and 200 in Brisbane.
Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale says floodwaters have covered all but the overhead signs and billboards above many shops in the CBD.
"The water's rising and it's swallowing up your city - it makes it very hard," he said.
"But it's most important to get a message out to the community that these are only floodwaters and the most important thing is our safety and I want to make sure no other lives are lost."
Search and rescue teams will go to Grantham and Murphy's Creek to begin the grim task of searching destroyed properties for bodies.
Ms Bligh says it is going to be a very hard day for the community.
"Families who are still holding out hope some of them are likely to have their hopes tragically crushed," she said.
"So I think it's going to be a tough and emotional day in the Lockyer Valley as those search and rescue teams get in there for the first time."
A telephone hotline - 1300 993 191 - has been set up for people seeking information on friends and relatives caught up in the flooding disaster.
