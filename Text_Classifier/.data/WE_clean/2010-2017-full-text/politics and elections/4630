Foley steps down as SA deputy premier
Embattled Kevin Foley has stepped down as South Australian deputy premier and treasurer, apologising for perhaps being too much of a bully boy.
Like his colleagues Industrial Relations Minister Paul Holloway and Police Minister Michael Wright, Mr Foley will formally tell Labor caucus on Monday that he's handing over two of his key portfolios.
He's been under pressure to quit since he and Premier Mike Rann faced calls for generational change at the state ALP conference in November while angry unions protested outside against the tough state budget.
But a defiant Mr Foley denies he was pressured into stepping down as the powerful right faction seeks generational change.
"I have not been pushed, I have not felt pressured, I don't feel that I have been knifed, I haven't made any threats, I haven't demanded anything in exchange," he told reporters on Sunday in the heart of his Port Adelaide electorate.
Mr Foley, one of Australia's longest-serving treasurers, was seen as a smart and capable man in the job.
