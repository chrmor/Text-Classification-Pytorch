Mexican prisoners moved for Mel Gibson film
About 300 inmates have been transferred from a Mexican prison to make way for a Mel Gibson film, despite protests from their relatives.
Director of the Ignacio Allende prison, Gerardo Duran, said the inmates would be bussed to at least four other jails.
He added that about 1,200 prisoners remained at the facility in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz.
Families demonstrated outside the jail last month saying the move would make visits difficult and expensive.
Prison officials have not ruled out transferring more detainees to Villa Aldama penitentiary 50km (31 miles) away.
Military officers were deployed to keep relatives away from prisoners during the transfer - which took five hours.
The AFP news agency reported that many of the inmates fought with police last week after learning of the move.
It is not known when filming will begin, nor when the prisoners will be returned to the prison.
In early December, Veracruz governor Fidel Herrera Beltran announced Gibson planned to film several scenes of his upcoming feature in the state, including at Ignacio Allende prison, a location he scouted in April.
Gibson also filmed his 2006 Mayan-language film Apocalypto in Veracruz.
