L.A. County mudslides trap numerous cars; I-5 closed to traffic
As Michael Henderson left his job in Lancaster for his evening drive home to the Leona Valley, he was shocked to see that the roads had seemingly become rivers. Emergency vehicles zoomed past him in every direction. "It was just panic," Henderson said. "I'm in an intersection with gushing water and I knew I couldn't stop, but I couldn't keep going because I couldn't see." He turned off the road and took shelter under an awning at a roadside store until it was safe to continue. He made it home after two hours, with the sun setting on mud and debris on the roadways. Henderson and his family moved to the Leona Valley less than a year ago and hadn't seen much in the way of weather until now. "This is quite an introduction," he said.
