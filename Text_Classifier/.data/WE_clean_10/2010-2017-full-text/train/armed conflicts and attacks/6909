5 soldiers, 2 al-Qaida militants killed in central Yemen, intelligence officer assassinated
A Yemeni security official says five soldiers and two al-Qaida militants have been killed in fighting in the central town of Radda, and a senior intelligence officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in the south.
During Yemen's 2011 uprising, al-Qaida occupied large sections of the south before being driven out by the new government. Al-Qaida has retaliated with assassinations and bombings at military compounds.
The official says the soldiers were killed Saturday when al-Qaida fighters attacked a military checkpoint in Radda.
Another security official says Col. Ahmed Abdel-Razaq, who was the intelligence chief in Mukalla, the capital of southern Hadramawt province, was killed Saturday by two gunmen on a motorcycle.
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
