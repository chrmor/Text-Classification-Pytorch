Nobel laureate Soyinka starts political party
Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka has launched a political party in Nigeria, months before the presidential election.
He was elected chairman of The Democratic Front for a People's Federation at an event in Lagos.
The new party says it aims to tackle corruption and improve health and education in Nigeria.
Wole Soyinka's books and plays have won worldwide acclaim but he is also renowned as a political activist.
His book "The Man Died" in 1972 dealt with his period in jail during Nigeria's 1967-70 civil war.
He was the first African to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1986.
State, presidential and legislative elections are due to take place next year but it is unclear whether Mr Soyinka intends to be a candidate.
