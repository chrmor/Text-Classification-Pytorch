British Airways Jet Catches Fire at Las Vegas Airport; 20 Injured
The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the engine failure that caused an intense fire on a British Airways Boeing 777 as it prepared for takeoff in Las Vegas, sending 20 passengers to the hospital.
Passengers used inflatable slides to escape the blaze on Tuesday afternoon at McCarran International Airport, just before the plane was to embark on a 10-hour flight to London Gatwick.
Thick clouds of black smoke billowed from the left engine of the plane as the passengers scurried across the tarmac. Witnesses said the fire was so intense that it melted windows on the plane.
Sunrise Hospital said it treated 20 patients. The airline said Wednesday that everyone had been released. It also pledged its cooperation with the NTSB.
Cockpit alarms could be heard on recordings of the pilots' mayday call to air traffic controllers.
The Boeing 777 experienced an engine failure after being cleared for takeoff at around 4:13 p.m. (7:13 p.m. ET) at McCarran International Airport, the airport said.
