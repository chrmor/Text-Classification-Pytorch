Remember how Lenny Dykstra was arrested for bankruptcy fraud?  Yeah, he’s indicted now. Thirteen counts, reports CNBC’s Darren Rovell.  If he is convicted on all counts he faces 80 years.  Given his business acumen, however, I’m sure he could talk it down to 95.
This is just the latest in a long line of fun for Mr. Dykstra. He was once accused of destroying and/or absconding with property he shouldn’t be destroying or absconding with, though that may be related to the current charges (haven’t seen the indictment). While his financial troubles have mostly hurt himself, it is apparent that he frittered away his son’s signing bonus too.  And then there are the various and sundry issues he’s had ranging from ripping off his escort to having some, ahem, trouble with his would-be cleaning lady.
Enjoy life on the inside, Lenny. You’ve done enough outside.
