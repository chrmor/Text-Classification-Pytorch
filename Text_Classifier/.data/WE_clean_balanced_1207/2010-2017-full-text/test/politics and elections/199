Russia lawmakers back banning gay couple adoptions
Russia's lower house of parliament on Tuesday overwhelming voted in favour of a bill banning adoption of Russian orphans by gay couples in countries where same-sex marriages are legal.
In the second of three readings, lawmakers backed the proposal with a vote of 443 for and none against. If the bill becomes law it will affect married gay couples as well as unmarried people of any sexual orientation.
