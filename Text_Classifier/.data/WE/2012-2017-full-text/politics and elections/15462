Amid increased violence, Kerry meets with Israeli and Palestinian leaders
In addition to the local unrest, Kerry referred to the turmoil engulfing the wider region. "We are deeply concerned about Syria, about Daesh, about regional unrest," the secretary said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State militant group. It was in everyone's interest to work together against the violence "interrupting too much of the daily life of too many nations," he said.
