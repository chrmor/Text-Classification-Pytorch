Cocaine sacks accidentally shipped to UN HQ
The drugs, worth around $2 million, were hidden in hollowed-out books inside of bags that carried the global body's famous blue emblem.
Police said the sacks were shipped from Mexico but that when parcel sorters in Ohio were unable to find an address on them they simply forwarded them to the UN.
"It is my understanding that because there was no addressee, the DHL just thought well that's the UN symbol so we should ship it on to UN headquarters and let them figure out who it was supposed to go to," New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told AFP.
Staff at the UN identified the bags as "obvious fakes" after they triggered a security alert at the Manhattan headquarters of the international forum.
"The working theory now is that possibly it was never meant to have left Mexico at all," Mr Browne said. "Somebody in Mexico is probably in trouble now having let a significant amount of cocaine out of their possession."
UN officials said the bags were like flour sacks but were the wrong colour or material to be any kind of official bag. "It was not a diplomatic pouch. That I can say categorically," UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
