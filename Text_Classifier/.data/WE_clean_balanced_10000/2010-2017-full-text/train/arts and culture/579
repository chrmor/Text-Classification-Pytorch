Video: North Korea: statue of former leader Kim Jong II unveiled in Pyongyang
Top political and military leaders attended the unveiling ceremony on Tuesday on the grounds of the Mansudae Art Studio.
The monumental sculpture depicts Kim Jong Il and his father, North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, on horseback. Officials say it is the first sculpture of Kim Jong Il cast in bronze, like the imposing statue of Kim Il Sung in central Pyongyang.
According to North Korean state media, while he was alive Kim Jong Il gave instructions that he did not want to see a statue of himself put up.
Sculptors at the Mansudae Art Studio said that after Kim Jong Il's death, North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un ordered them to create this statue.
They added that they were working on another statue of Kim Jong Il to be set up on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang, where a giant statue of his father Kim Il Sung has stood for decades.
While there are other statues of Kim Jong Il in North Korea, but they are not in public or open spaces.
Kim Jong Il died in December, and would have turned 70 on Thursday.
