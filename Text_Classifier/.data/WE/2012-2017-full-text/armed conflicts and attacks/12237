Suicide Bomber Attacks NATO Convoy in Kabul
KABUL â€” A suicide car bomber rammed an explosives-laden Toyota Corolla into a NATO convoy in the Afghan capital on Thursday, killing one person, according to authorities.
The NATO-led coalition confirmed that one person died in an attack on a coalition convoy but did not provide further details.
Afghanistan's deputy interior minister Gen. Ayoub Salanghi said the driver of the vehicle that was rammed was killed and another person inside was injured in the attack near Kabul's Zanbaq Square.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast in a Twitter post.
While Salanghi said "the suicide bomber targeted a convoy of Turkish embassy," the Taliban claimed the "target of the attack was U.S. forces convoy, not any embassy or the citizens of any other country."
