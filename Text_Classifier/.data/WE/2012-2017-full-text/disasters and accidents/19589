One pilot dead, a second injured in U-2 spy plane crash in rural Northern California
The U-2 flies to 70,000 feet — higher than any other U.S. military aircraft. It's also among the oldest. The spy plane was first designed during the Eisenhower administration to breach the Iron Curtain and, as engineers said, snap "picture postcards for Ike" of hidden military strongholds in the Soviet Union. There have been 33 updated versions of the jet that still flies today.
