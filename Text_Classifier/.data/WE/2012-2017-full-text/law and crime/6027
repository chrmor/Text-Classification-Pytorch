A member of the LulzSec hacker group was sentence to a year in federal prison Thursday as a result of his involvement with a cyberattack in 2011.
The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ordered Cody Andrew Kretsinger, a 25-year-old Decatur, Ill., resident to also serve a year of home detention after he completes his time in prison. He will also be required to perform 1,000 hours of community service and pay more than $605,000 in restitution.
Kretsinger, who went by the name of "recursion" during his days with LulzSec, pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and unauthorized impairment of a protected computer in connection with the hacker group's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer systems in May and June 2011.
Kretsinger's sentencing comes one week after another LulzSec hacker pleaded guilty to his involvement with the hacker group. Ryan Ackroyd admitted to his involvement with the attacks and will be sentenced along with three other LulzSec hackers May 14 by London's Southwark Crown Court.
