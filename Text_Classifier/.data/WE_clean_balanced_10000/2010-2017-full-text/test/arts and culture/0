Scholars Unveil New Edition of Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’
The result is systematic and dense, and requires close attention. “We wanted literally to surround Hitler with our comments,” Mr. Hartmann said.
The two-volume edition will sell for 59 euros, or about $63, with more than 200 orders to date, Mr. Wirsching and Mr. Hartmann said. There will be no special school edition, although “every intelligent history teacher can work with our comments,” Mr. Hartmann said. He said that there would be no e-book but that discussions to make the work available online were continuing.
Mr. Hartmann noted that he had worked on an earlier volume of Hitler’s speeches from the mid-1920s into the 1930s. “The public interest was almost zero,” he noted with a smile.
Sven-Felix Kellerhoff, a historian and senior editor at the daily Die Welt, argued that “Mein Kampf” elicited a special fascination mostly because of the ban imposed in 1945 by the Allies and extended ever since by Bavaria.
“The problem with ‘Mein Kampf’ is that everyone knows the title but nothing of the book itself,” Mr. Kellerhoff said in an interview. “The myth is that it is banned, and so dangerous that the German public cannot be trusted with it.”
“The false policy of Bavaria gave rise to this myth,” he added, arguing that Bavaria should have lifted the ban at the very latest by the 1980s or 1990s, when a generation had grown up without Nazism. Mr. Kellerhoff has just published his own book, “Mein Kampf: The Career of a German Book,” which runs a little less than 370 pages and traces the history of Hitler’s work.
“Mein Kampf” is available online, and printed copies can be obtained at antique shops or markets, particularly in countries bordering Germany. During Nazi rule, from 1933 to 1945, it was translated into 18 languages and sold more than 12 million copies. Many of them were distributed by the Nazis to, say, newlyweds.
