Isco wins 'Golden Boy' award
There can be no doubt that Francisco Rom�n Alarc�n is something special. The talented M�laga playmaker better known as Isco has long been earning rave reviews in Spain and is beginning to draw admiring glances from across Europe. And now, as of today, he belongs to an exclusive club of winners of the 'Golden Boy' award, an accolade for the "best up-and-coming youngster in Europe", his club has confirmed on its website.
By capturing the 'Golden Boy', Isco joins illustrious company including Leo Messi, Sergio Ag�ero, Wayne Rooney and Cesc Fabregas. The Borussia Dortmund starlet Mario G�tze won the award last year.
The M�laga midfielder received a total of 137 votes, beating off the challenge of Milan's Italian-Egyptian striker Stephan El Shaarawy (125 votes) and the Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is currently on loan at Atl�tico de Madrid from Chelsea (116 votes). Nominees for the 'Golden Boy', which was established by Turin-based sports daily 'Tuttosport', must be under 21 (this year's candidates were all born after 1st January 1992) and ply their trade in Europe.
Born on 21st April 1992 in Benalm�dena, in the province of M�laga, Isco has featured at all youth levels for the Spanish national side, as well as earning two senior call-ups. He was also named the best breakthrough player in 'La Liga' in the 2011-12 season. Isco is expected to be presented with the award by a representative from the newspaper tonight at the Rosaleda, the M�laga stadium, ahead of his team's league clash with Real Madrid.
