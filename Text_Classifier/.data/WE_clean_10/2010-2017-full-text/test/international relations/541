America is the (second) most generous country in the world
When it comes to charitable giving, the U.S. comes in second place.
Myanmar is the most generous country in the world, according to the U.K.-based CAF America, an international nonprofit organization that’s part of the World Giving Index and that promotes effective giving and philanthropy worldwide. Among more than 145 countries surveyed, Myanmar came in first place with an overall score of 66% — meaning 66% of people say they have helped a stranger, volunteered their time or given money to a charity in the past year — while the U.S. came in second place with a score of 61%. The two shared first place last year. Myanmar saw an increase in the number of people who say they donated money in 2014 versus the previous year.
“The majority of Myanmarese people are highly devout Theravada Buddhists, regularly giving money and time to ordained monks and nuns, and for the upkeep of temples,” the report concluded. Such charitable giving is integral to religious observance among Theravada Buddhists and while, in many cases, the amounts given will be very small, they still have significant religious meaning and so individuals give regularly, sometimes daily, it added. Myanmar is classified by the World Bank as a lower middle income country, while the U.S. is regarded as a high income country.
The World Giving Index is primarily based on data from research firm Gallup’s “World View World Poll,” an ongoing research project carried out in more than 145 countries in 2014; it encompasses interviews with over 130,000 people worldwide. Of course, people may be inclined to exaggerate their generous spirit in a survey, but Hart says the questions are phrased in such a way to help prevent that.
The measurement for donating money is based on the number of people who give money — and not on the actual dollar amount donated — and on those who say they have volunteered their time and helped a stranger. Burundi was ranked at the bottom of the countries in the Index, with China, Yemen and Lithuania just above them.
But there was good news for the U.S. The “CAF World Giving Index” shows that America ranks higher for generosity than any other nation in the Group of 20 or G-20 forum of countries. “It’s great to see that America ranks as the most generous country in the developed world,” says Ted Hart, CEO of CAF America. “Being one of the most generous nations on earth is something that Americans are rightly proud of.” But the U.S. score of 61% was down from 64% last year. “This report also shows that there can be no room for complacency,” he added.
However, the proportion of Americans saying they had donated to charity fell from a record high of 68% last year to 63% this year — equivalent to 11 million fewer people giving when extrapolated for the entire population. And the number of Americans who said they had helped a stranger was also down slightly from 79% in 2013 to 76% in 2014. (Overall, more than 31% of the world’s population had given money to charity, up 3.2 percentage points on 2013. After the U.S., New Zealand came in at No. 3, followed by Canada, Australia, the U.K., the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, Ireland and Malaysia.)
But the percentage of people who give to charities varies across the U.S., according to a separate analysis released last year of Internal Revenue Service tax returns by researchers at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a Washington, D.C.-based periodical. New Hampshire residents give 1.74% of their income to charity, the least of any state; the state’s motto is “live free or die” and is based on strict individualism. Utah — the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — was No. 1 on that list, with residents there giving 6.56% of their income to charity. (Mormon teachings encourage adherents to give 10%.) Many of the most generous states were in or around the Bible Belt.
