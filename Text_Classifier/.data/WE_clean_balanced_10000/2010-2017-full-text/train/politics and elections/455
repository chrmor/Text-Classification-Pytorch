Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei endorses Hassan Rouhani as president
Supreme leader gives official approval to Rouhani, who won landslide victory in presidential elections on 14 June
Iran's supreme leader has formally endorsed Hassan Rouhani as the country's president, opening the way for the moderate cleric to take over from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
In a ceremony broadcast live on state television on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave his official approval for Rouhani. As the ultimate authority in Iran, Khamenei has the final say in all key matters, including Rouhani's upcoming selections for key cabinet posts, such as the foreign and intelligence ministers.
Rouhani, who will take the oath of office in parliament on Sunday, won a landslide victory in the presidential elections on 14 June. He has pledged to follow a "path of moderation" and promised greater openness over the country's nuclear programme, which has placed it at odds with the west.
All foreign diplomats were invited to the inauguration but Britain declined to send an envoy.
Douglas Alexander, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, said the decision was ill-judged and short-sighted.
"Britain should be pursuing a twin-track diplomatic approach to Iran where possible by improving bilateral relations whilst also maintaining peaceful pressure through sanctions," he said. "An open dialogue with Iran is not only important in relation to Britain's security, but also to raise vital matters such as freedom of speech and expression in Iran with the newly elected president."
