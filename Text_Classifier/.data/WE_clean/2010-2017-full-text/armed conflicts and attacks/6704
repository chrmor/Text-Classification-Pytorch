Egypt extends Hosni Mubarak's detention for 15 days
Egypt's authorities have extended the detention of ousted President Hosni Mubarak for another 15 days.
It comes after the 83-year-old was questioned in a hospital in a Red Sea resort on charges of profiteering, Egypt's Mena news agency says.
His wife, Suzanne, was also questioned for the first time by investigators.
Mr Mubarak was forced out of power on 11 February after a popular uprising. He is also accused of involvement in the killings of anti-regime protesters.
Essam al-Gohari, who heads Egypt's Illicit Gains Authority, "has ordered the detention of former president Hosni Mubarak for 15 days following questioning [on Thursday] in Sharm el-Sheikh that lasted three hours, over accusations of the illegal acquisition of wealth", Mena reported.
Mr Mubarak is in custody in Sharm el-Sheikh's military hospital after suffering heart problems.
More than 20 Mubarak-era ministers and businessmen linked to the regime have been detained since Mr Mubarak's departure.
Last week, former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly was sentenced to 12 years in jail on charges of money-laundering and profiteering.
Adly also faces separate charges of ordering troops to fire on demonstrators. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
