Virgin, Tiger suspend flights
Virgin Australia and Tiger Airways have begun cancelling flights as the ash cloud from a volcano in Chile returns to Australian airspace.
Virgin suspended all Adelaide and Mildura flights for tomorrow, while Tiger Airways announced it was cancelling eight flights, four between Sydney and Melbourne and four between Melbourne and Adelaide.
"The current forecast suggests the ash plume will below 20,000 feet over Adelaide and Mildura tomorrow. With this in mind we are suspending these services tomorrow," said the head of the Virgin Australia's operations, Sean Donohue.
A Qantas spokeswoman said that while the airline will have a better indication of the as cloud's impact tonight and early morning tomorrow, at this stage some early flights from Adelaide might be delayed.
