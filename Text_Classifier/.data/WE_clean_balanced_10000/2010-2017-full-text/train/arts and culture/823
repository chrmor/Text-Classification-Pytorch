Zsa Zsa Gabor 'in an extremely serious condition'
Publicist John Blanchette said that he had spoken with Ms Gabor's husband Frederic Von Anhalt, who had told him of her condition.
She asked that a priest read her the last rites on Sunday.
Mr Blanchette described the situation as "very sad."
Mr Blanchette says Ms Gabor was in surgery for several hours on Saturday for the removal of the clots from her upper body, one of them very close to her heart.
Ms Gabor was taken to hospital on Friday afternoon because she was bleeding and in a lot of pain.
She had broken her hip July 17, had hip replacement surgery and had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday.
The actress's health has been declining in recent years.
She was left partially paralysed after a car accident in 2002, which forced her to use a wheelchair, and she suffered a stroke three years later.
The Hungarian-born Gabor has appeared in more than 30 movies, and her penchant for calling everyone "dah-ling" in her Hungarian accent made her a well-known Hollywood personality.
She, along with her two glamorous sisters Eva and Magda made several appearances on radio and television shows in the 1950s and 1960s. Zsa Zsa's first starring role in the movies was in Moulin Rouge.
Married nine times to a string of husbands that included a Turkish diplomat and the hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, Ms Gabor celebrated her 24th wedding anniversary to Mr Von Anhalt in the hospital on Saturday, said Mr Blanchette.
