Buried chemicals on U.S. military base removed from S. Korea
SEOUL, June 2 (Yonhap) -- Chemicals that were buried at a U.S. military base in South Korea in the 1970s were excavated and removed from the South for apparent disposal, a U.S. commander told the South's environment minister, ministry officials said Thursday. South Korea and the U.S. have launched a joint investigation into claims by retired American soldiers that they had helped dump large amounts of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange in 1978 inside Camp Carroll in Chilgok, 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul.
