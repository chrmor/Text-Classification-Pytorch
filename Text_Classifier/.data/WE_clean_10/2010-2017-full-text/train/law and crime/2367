Sacramento mayor, former Phoenix Suns star Kevin Johnson punches protestor who threw pie in his face
Former Phoenix Suns guard and current Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson assaulted a protester after he was hit in the face with a pie Wednesday.
Nick Miller of eastbayexpress.com wrote "multiple sources have confirmed" that Johnson "tackled and assaulted the protester in a 'bloody' brawl" during a dinner event in Sacramento.
According to eastbayexpress.com, a witness reported the protester charged Johnson and threw a store-bought pie in his face. Another witness said the pie had a whipped-cream topping.
The protester then reportedly had some words for Johnson, prompting the mayor to punch the protester in the face at least "half a dozen" times.
"One witness described it as a 'bloody pulp,'" Miller wrote, adding Sacramento Police arrested 32-year-old Sean Thompson for felony assault of a public official. Thompson'sÂ mugshot can be found here.
Johnson played for the Suns for 12 seasons after being acquired in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1987. He was a three-time NBA All-Star and helped lead the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals.
The 50-year-old Johnson is a Sacramento native and played collegiately at Cal-Berkeley. In March, several women came forward to accuse Johnson of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred when they were in their teens.
