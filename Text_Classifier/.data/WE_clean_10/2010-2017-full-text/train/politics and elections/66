@LulzSec hacks into The Sun's website; redirect to their Twitter feed
HACKERS from @LulzSec have gone to work on the website of Britain's biggest tabloid newspaper.
The homepage of the News International newspaper was replaced with a story announcing the false death of Rupert Murdoch, earlier today.
The Sun remains under the control of LulzSec, with the homepage redirecting to the hackers' Twitter feed.
"TheSun.co.uk now redirects to our twitter feed. Hello, everyone that wanted to visit The Sun! How is your day? Good? Good!" the page reads. The Sun is owned by News Corporation, the parent company of news.com.au.
