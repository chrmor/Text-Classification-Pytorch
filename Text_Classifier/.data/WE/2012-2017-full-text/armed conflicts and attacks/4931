Suicide Bomber Kills Members of a Militia in Iraq
A suicide bomber struck members of a militia opposed to Al Qaeda north of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 22 people and wounding 44, officials said. The blast was the latest in a string of attacks against security forces and civilians. More than 200 Iraqis have been killed since the beginning of the year. In Monday’s bombing, the attacker mingled with men gathering to collect their salaries outside the militia’s headquarters in Taji, about 12 miles north of Baghdad. Three Iraqi soldiers and 19 members of the Sunni militia, known as the Awakening Council, were killed, police officials said. The militia was formed from Sunni fighters who switched sides and joined American and Iraqi government forces to fight Al Qaeda at the height of the insurgency.
