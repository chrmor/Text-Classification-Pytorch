Rampaging bull injures 40 in Spanish arena
A bull has injured 40 people after jumping out of the arena at a Spanish bullring and marauding through the crowd.
TV footage shows spectators trying to restrain the animal - one fan grabs its tail - as it careers through the stands.
Most of the injured were treated for cuts and bruises, officials in the northern town of Tafalla said.
But nine people were taken to hospital in nearby Pamplona.
Among them was a 10-year-old boy who apparently suffered multiple bruising when the bull fell on him, and a 24-year-old who was gored.
The animal was brought under control after several minutes and was later killed.
Analysts say bulls occasionally leap security fences at bullrings but they rarely make it into the crowd.
