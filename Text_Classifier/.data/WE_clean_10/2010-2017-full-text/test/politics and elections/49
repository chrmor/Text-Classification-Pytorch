Croatian gov't survives no-confidence vote
ZAGREB, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Croatia’s centre-right coalition government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday, requested by the opposition over corruption and economic problems in the European Union candidate state.
The Social Democrats tabled the no-confidence motion last week but Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor’s government, led by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), mustered 79 votes to defeat it in the 153-seat parliament.
