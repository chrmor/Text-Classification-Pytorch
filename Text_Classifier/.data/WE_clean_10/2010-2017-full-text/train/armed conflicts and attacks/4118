Police: Girl suicide bomber kills 5, injures 41 in Boko Haram bus station attack in Nigeria
Police say a girl suicide bomber killing five people in an attack at the crowded entrance to a bus station in Damaturu in northeast Nigeria.
Assistant Superintendent Toyin Gbagedesin says 41 people were wounded in the Tuesday morning explosion.
He says the bomber appeared to be about 14 years old.
Nigeria's homegrown Islamic extremist group has used dozens of girls and women in recent suicide bombings in Nigeria and neighboring Chad, Cameroon and Niger, raising fears it is using kidnap victims.
More than 1,000 have been killed since President Muhammadu Buhari was elected in March with a pledge to annihilate the militants.
