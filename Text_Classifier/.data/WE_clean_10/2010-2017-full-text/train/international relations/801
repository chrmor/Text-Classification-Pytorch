39 Pakistani prisoners come back home
The Indian government released 39 Pakistani prisoners, including two women, as a goodwill gesture. Border guard officer Lakhbir Singh said the detainees were held in eight separate prisons on charges of either overstaying their visa or illegally crossing to India.
The Government of Pakistan decided on Monday to reciprocate the gesture by calling for the release of 89 Indian prisoners from Pakistani jails. - Photos by AFP
