Raw Sewage Pumped Into River
The level of the river is simply getting too high to keep the Monroe Pumping Station operational. Crews have removed the pumps and electrical from the station, they will be returned when the river recedes.
The Monroe Station is one of 17 pumping stations used by the city of Omaha and the only one being shut down.
Marty Grate says, "We are hopeful that this will be the only one the others are protected by the levee system so we would have to have a levee failure to have a problem with those."
The Monroe Station handles some 6,000,000 gallons of waste per day.
