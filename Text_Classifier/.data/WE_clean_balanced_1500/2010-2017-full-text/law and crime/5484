US-Colombia bases deal unconstitutional
Colombia's constitutional court on Tuesday declared a US-Colombian accord that gave the US military access to at least seven Colombian bases to be unconstitutional.
The court ordered the government to submit the agreement to the Colombian Congress, arguing that it should be executed in the form of an international treaty that would be subject to congressional approval in order to comply with constitutional norms.
The court did not address whether the agreement itself was appropriate.
The agreement "is an arrangement which requires the State to take on new obligations as well as an extension of previous ones and as such should be handled as an international treaty, that is, subject to coNgressional approval," said the court's chief justice Mauricio Gonzalez.
The court decided in March to review the agreement after a group of lawyers filed a complaint arguing it was unconstitutional.
The lawsuit claimed the October 2009 military accord was invalid because it was signed by the government of President Alvaro Uribe without prior discussion in Congress, as mandated by the constitution.
