Tsunami warning cancelled as magnitude-7.0 earthquake strikes Vanuatu
A tsunami warning issued after a shallow magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck the Vanuatu island of Malekula, 64 kilometres south south-east of Luganville, has been cancelled.
But the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) has warned that minor sea level fluctuations of up to 0.3 metres above and below the normal tide may continue over the next few hours.
The sparsely populated village of Norsup was one kilometre from its epicentre, which struck on land at a depth of 35 kilometres, the US Geological Survey said.
The PTWC earlier advised people located near coastal areas, within 300 kilometres of the epicentre, to stay alert for information and follow instructions from national and local authorities.
Waves measuring one to three metres above the tide level were possible along Vanuatu coasts.
The alert was also in force for New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands for damaging waves.
There was no threat of a Pacific-wide tsunami, the PTWC said.
Staff at the Bauerfield International Airport told Pacific Beat they felt the quake, but damage to the capital, Port Vila, was unlikely.
