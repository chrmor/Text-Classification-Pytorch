Ancient Gaza tunnels discovered
Archaeologists digging at a site on Gaza's border with Egypt have discovered ancient tunnels in the same area as today's smuggling tunnels.
They are believed to be a part of a hidden city that is estimated to be over two thousand years old. However, the excavation work is complicated by the blockade of Gaza and there is also the constant risk of being hit by an Israeli rocket targeting a modern tunnel.
There is also a shortage of funding for adequate excavation and looters are a constant threat.
