Bombs Hit Syria During Visit From Peace Envoy
Two blasts in Syria hit predominantly Christian areas in the capital Damascus and the most populous city Aleppo on Sunday as President Bashar al-Assad met with special peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
The Syrian attacks came two days after a blast in neighboring Lebanon killed a top security chief and plunged the country deeper into a crisis linked to the turmoil in Syria now into its 20th month.Â No one claimed responsibility for the blasts.
