NATO Agrees On 'Comprehensive Package Of Assistance' For Ukraine
NATO says defense ministers of the alliance have agreed to "boost" support for Ukraine with a "comprehensive package of assistance."
In a statement issued on June 15 following a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission in Brussels, the alliance said the package aimed to "help Ukraine strengthen its defenses by building stronger security structures."
NATO is already implementing projects under the "trust funds" established for Ukraine to help it reform its military -- including on command and control, cyberdefense, and rehabilitating wounded soldiers.
"We are also developing new projects, including in the areas of countering hybrid warfare and explosive devices," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
"Modernizing Ukraine's forces while they are engaged in conflict is no easy task, but the government is making good progress," Stoltenberg said.
