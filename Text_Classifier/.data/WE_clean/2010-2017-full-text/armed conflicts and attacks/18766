Hamas: "Wait for suicide attacks on every bus, café and street"
"Zionists, wait and see stabbing attacks everywhere. Wait for suicide attacks on every bus, café and street. Wait for the rage and for revenge for Gaza, wait for the flames of the West Bank and inside you [Israel]. Zionists, do you still remember the rockets that made Tel-Aviv and the Israeli Parliament tremble? We just wanted to tell you that we have thousands of them. Zionists, [we] can reach you above ground and below it. So start counting the number of coffins you'll need in these months. Zionists, the resistance has many goals, it has the ability to reach places you thought were safe. Look, they [the rockets] are on their way to you now and will reach you soon." [Al-Aqsa TV (Hamas), July 9, 2014]
