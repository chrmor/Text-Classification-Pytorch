Bad eggs hit 1200
SALMONELLA-infected eggs traceable to a large producer in Iowa may have caused as many as 1200 cases of intestinal illness in at least 10 US states in recent weeks.
Wright County Egg has issued a recall for 380 million eggs, some laid as long ago as May 17, but the vast majority have already been consumed.
State and local health departments are studying cases of salmonella illness in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.
The number of cases is expected to rise in the next few weeks.
