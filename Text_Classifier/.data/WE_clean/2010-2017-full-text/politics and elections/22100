Protesters, police clash at Aquino QC residence
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines) — It's the eve of President Benigno Aquino III's last State of the Nation Address (SONA) and things are apparently starting to heat up.
A scuffle between protesters and the police broke out on Saturday (July 26) in front of the president's residence on Times Street in Quezon City when members of  the group "Southern Tagalog Remove Aquino" roughed it out with members of the QC Police District who tried to push back the marchers' ranks.
Before this, the group unveiled an effigy of Aquino, depicting him as a "monster sitting in the Palace."
The protesters also had lunch on the street to show contrast of their humble meal to the "grandiose" P2.5 million food budget for the SONA on Monday (July 27).
The group's spokesperson, Iya Franca, said the president protected the interests of his friends and family in the past five years.
[He used his position to preserve their wealth and power, his family and his "shooting range" friends.]
The protesters added that they would also give a version of SONA after Aquino's speech and they would evaluate the performance of the administration.
