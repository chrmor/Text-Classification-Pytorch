ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to impose a ban on Jundullah and all the terrorist groups that claim responsibility for terror attacks.
Sources said that the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), on the directives of the Interior Ministry, has decided to impose a ban on Jundullah and all splinter groups of terrorists.
