IDF kills terrorist who fired at soldiers near Jenin
A terrorist opened fire at an IDF post near Mevo Dotan in the West Bank on Thursday. A Kfir Brigade force fired back and killed the terrorist. No soldier was hurt.
A preliminary inquiry indicates that a terrorist armed with a Kalashnikov rifle approached the IDF post and started firing. The soldiers left their fortified positions and fired back, killing the terrorist as a result. It is currently estimated that the terrorist was not aware that the post was fortified.
The IDF nevertheless considers the event as an attempted terrorist attack and said the soldiers acted in a professional manner.
Military sources noted this was an unusual incident. "Recently, there have been several cases in which Palestinians approached checkpoints in an attempt to carry out attacks against IDF soldiers. However, in this case – for the first time in a long time - the Palestinian was armed and had fired his weapon."
Mevo Dotan's security officer Motti Emor described the incident: "This event should turn on a red light, it should worry us as well as the army."
This is the second incident this month where a terrorist targets soldiers. Some two weeks ago a Palestinian terrorist was shot to death in the Bekaot checkpoint in the West Bank. He was carrying two pipe bombs ready to be detonated as well as a knife.
