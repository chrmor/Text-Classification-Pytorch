Rocket from Gaza falls near children's bus stop
Police sappers early Monday morning collected the shards of a Kassam rocket that Palestinians earlier fired from the Gaza Strip at the Hof Ashkelon area.
The rocket was found several hours after it fell near a bus stop used by schoolchildren. There were no injuries in the attack, but the bus stop sustained light damage.
Late Sunday night the Code Red alert, which warns of incoming rockets or missiles from the Gaza Strip, was heard in several communities in the area to the east of the coastal city of Ashkelon.

Earlier this month, three Kassam rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory, all landing in open Gazan territory.
The rocket fire followed a series of unsuccessful attempts to launch attacks from the Gaza Strip in recent months.
Last month, Israel and Gaza marked the one-year anniversary since Operation Pillar of Defense, an eight-day offensive launched by Israel to stem rocket fire from Gaza.
