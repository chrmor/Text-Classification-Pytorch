Tropical Cyclone Enawo made landfall March 7 in Madagascar in what turned out to be the island's strongest landfall in 13 years.
Just prior to landfall at 11 a.m. local time March 7, the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated maximum sustained winds of 145 mph, the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane.
MeteoFrance estimated Enawo's central pressure was 925 millibars in the few hours before the eye crossed land between Antalaha and Sambava.
The above video was taken in Sambava, Madagascar around landfall on March 7.
According to NOAA's best track database, Enawo appeared to have been the strongest landfall in Madagascar, by peak estimated winds, since Gafilo made landfall as a Category 4-equivalent storm in roughly the same area of northeast Madagascar in March 2004, claiming 363 lives, according to the EM-DAT International Disaster Database. More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, according to MeteoFrance.
The Associated Press reports that five people were killed by Enawo. Damage caused by the cyclone also forced 10,000 people to leave their homes.
More than a foot of rain drenched the town of Sambava near where the center of Enawo moved inland. 
According to the World Bank Indicators, only 11 percent of Madagascar's roads are paved. 
According to Dr. Phil Klotzbach, activity in February in the Indian Ocean was at its third-lowest level on record. February is typically a peak month for hurricane-strength systems in that basin.

The southwestern Indian Ocean typically sees about 9 to 10 tropical cyclones each year, while 4 to 5 of these become hurricane-strength systems. 
The last tropical cyclone of at least hurricane strength to landfall in Madagascar was Hellen on Mar. 31, 2014.
Only two hurricane-strength tropical cyclones have made landfall on Madagascar's east coast this decade: Giovanna on Feb. 13, 2012, and Bingiza on Feb. 14, 2011, according to NOAA's Best Track database.
