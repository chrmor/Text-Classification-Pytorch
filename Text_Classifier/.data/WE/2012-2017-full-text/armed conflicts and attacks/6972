Bomb attack on security convoy kills at least 11 people in northwest Pakistan
Police say a bomb attack on a security convoy in northwest Pakistan has killed at least 11 people.
Police officer Mohammad Zahid says the blast Sunday in the main northwest city of Peshawar also wounded 19 people. Several vehicles and nearby shops were damaged in the attack.
No one has claimed responsibility. But suspicion will likely fall on the Pakistani Taliban. The group has been waging a bloody insurgency against the government for years that has killed thousands of security personnel and civilians.
Peshawar is located on the edge of Pakistan's semiautonomous tribal region, the main Taliban sanctuary in the country, and has been hit by scores of bombings over the years.
