Arab foreign ministers offer Syrian opposition coalition country's Arab League seat
Arab foreign ministers have offered the Syrian opposition coalition the country's seat at the Arab League on condition that it first forms a representative executive council.
Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby announced to offer to the Syrian National Coalition, the Western- and Arab-backed opposition umbrella group, on Wednesday in Cairo.
The 22-member Arab League suspended Syria's membership in 2011 after President Bashar Assad's government did not abide by an Arab peace plan that aimed to end the conflict.
