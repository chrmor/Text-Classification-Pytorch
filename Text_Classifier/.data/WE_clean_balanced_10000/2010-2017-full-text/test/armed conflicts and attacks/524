Another plane from the Russian Emergencies Ministry with humanitarian aid for Libya will take off for Tripoli from Moscow on Thursday, a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
On Wednesday, a Russian Emergencies Ministry's Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft delivered 36 metric tons of humanitarian aid to the Libyan city of Benghazi. The aid included rice, sugar, canned milk and fish.
"Another flight of a Russian Emergencies Ministry's plane to Tripoli carrying a similar cargo is scheduled for July 7," the statement said.
Libya has been rocked by fighting between pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces since mid-February.
An international military operation in Libya began on March 19, following a UN resolution authorizing countries "to take all necessary measures" to help protect Libyan civilians from attacks by Gaddafi forces, and was extended until late September.
