10 asylum seekers still missing off Java
Authorities are holding out little hope for at least 10 asylum seekers still missing after their boat sank in rough seas off Indonesia during a voyage to Australia.
The body of a nine-year-old boy was pulled from the water on Wednesday morning, as police said their mission was now one of recovery rather than rescue.
The death toll, which stood at eight confirmed deaths after the boy was found, was expected to rise, with at least 10 people still missing.
However, it's possible the number killed will be even higher, with authorities still trying to piece together exactly how many asylum seekers were aboard the vessel when it sank.
It's believed the boat, which left from Cilacap in Central Java with a crew of three, was carrying at least 70 asylum seekers who had arrived in Indonesia from the Middle East.
"The number is uncertain," Ciamis Water Police chief Samsudin said on Wednesday afternoon.
