Kitty Wells, the 'undisputed queen of country music,' dies at 92
“She was the undisputed queen of ,” singer Marty Stuart said Monday. “There’s more to being a queen than just calling yourself a queen -- it’s a title that goes with an entire lifetime of service and influence. You check the careers of anyone in this town [of Nashville], and you won’t find anyone with a more spotless career than Kitty Wells.”
