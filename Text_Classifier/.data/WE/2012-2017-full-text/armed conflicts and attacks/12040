Marseille police fired on by 'hooded gunmen'
Marseille’s police chief came under automatic gunfire on Monday morning on the day the prime minister is due to visit the southern French city to praise "excellent" progress in fighting crime.
Pierre-Marie Bourniquel came under Kalashnikov fire upon entering the housing estate of Castellane, in the north of the Mediterranean port, after locals reported gunshots.
Mr Bourniquel was travelling with a police commando and seeking to reach a high point overlooking the estate where Zinedine Zidane, the international French footballer was brought up, when his vehicle came under attack.
He had sounded the police siren while approaching the area where armed clashes had reportedly erupted between at least two groups of “between five to ten people” in what is thought to be a drug-related dispute.
Undaunted, the gunmen trained their fire on the police chief, who had to duck down on the car floor to avoid being hit. The bullets passed within two or three metres of the vehicle, according to Le Figaro.
According to police sources cited by AFP, the initial shots were fired "in the air" and there are no victims.
Witnesses said the gunmen were "masked" and were "dressed in blue, like the police".
The violence comes after a 25-year old man was shot dead in the estate on January 15 in an apparent drug-related killing.
A local school and nursery were shut and the estate’s 7,000 residents told to stay indoors. A police helicopter flew overhead.
France has been tense since the Paris attacks in January in which Islamist gunmen killed 17 people, but there was no suggestion the Marseille incident had any religious connection.
Rather it is though the violence was part of a drug dealing turf war.
“The drugs trade in Marseille – for cannabis and cocaine – can bring in 100,000 euros (£75,000) per month just for one housing estate,” a police source told Le Figaro.
According to France Info radio, the neighbourhood was calm in the early afternoon.
The violence comes as Manuel Valls, the prime minister, was due in the Mediterranean port city on Monday afternoon to laud “excellent” progress in fighting crime, which has seen dozens of gangland murders and led to one prosecutor dubbing parts of Marseille “like the favelas of Rio”.
Several local politicians have called for the army to be sent to the city’s toughest housing estates to tackle gangland violence.
Mr Valls was due to announce extra means for local schools.
