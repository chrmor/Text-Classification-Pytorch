Court sentences 4 men to death in New Delhi gang rape case
Prosecutors had asked for the death penalty for the men, citing the "extreme brutality" of the attack, which took place on a moving bus in December. They had also argued the court needed to send a message to Indian society with its judgment.
The announcement of the sentence was met with cheering from hundreds of protesters outside the court. Posters and banners held by those in the crowd read "hang the rapists" and "a woman's life is the foundation, do not defile it."
Police said the men took turns raping the woman, using an iron rod to violate her as the bus drove around the city for almost an hour. When they had finished, they dumped the two victims by the side of the road.
The victim's parents had tears in their eyes as the judge read the verdict in which he said the men had been found guilty of "committing the murder of a helpless victim." Her brother wiped a tear from his cheek.
"The rape and murder of the young woman in Delhi last year was a horrific crime, and our deepest sympathy goes out to the victim's family. Those responsible must be punished, but the death penalty is never the answer," said Tara Rao, director of Amnesty International India. "Sending these four men to the gallows will accomplish nothing except short-term revenge."
Government figures show the number of women reporting rapes has risen significantly since the New Delhi attack and the heavy scrutiny that followed it. Observers said it indicates women who are victims of sexual attacks feel more emboldened to come forward than they did before.
Prosecution of such crimes has improved, said Kiran Bedi, a human rights activist and former Indian police officer. But it will take a heavy emphasis on the family and school environments to resolve the problem in the long run, Bedi said.
"You can't just begin and end with the police and the prosecution and the courts," she said. "You have to go backward and take it to the source."
