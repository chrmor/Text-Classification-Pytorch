Tropical Storm Meari pummels Korean peninsula
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Meari raked the west coast of South Korea over the weekend, leaving at least nine people dead and three missing, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said Monday.
Among the missing is a three-year-old toddler who was swept away by strong currents along the coast, the agency said.
The heavy rains and strong winds flooded fields and suspended dozens of sea routes around the peninsula, emergency officials said.
Meari has since moved over North Korea where it is expected to dissipate. The powerful storm pounded the cities of Kaesong and Haeju, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday.
Regional governments in South Korea have begun to tackle the clean-up effort, according to NEMA. The agency said Monday that most public facilities had been restored across the country.
The emergency agency said no damage estimates were immediately available.
