Dozens of Palestinians detained abused, say Israeli rights groups
JERUSALEM — Dozens of Palestinian detainees at an Israeli detention facility have been subjected to mistreatment, and in some cases torture, two Israeli human rights groups alleged on Wednesday.
The report was released at a time of heightened violence. In new bloodshed Wednesday, Israeli troops accidentally shot and killed a fellow soldier as they thwarted a Palestinian stabber in the West Bank, the military said.
The report by the B’Tselem and HaMoked rights groups presented accounts by 116 Palestinian detainees on conditions at the Shikma interrogation facility, run by the Israeli Shin Bet internal security agency.
It said detainees have been incarcerated in small, rank cells, often in isolation. Palestinian detainees told the Israeli rights groups that they were at times exposed to extreme heat or cold, bound to a chair and denied access to a shower for days or weeks. The detainees said they were shouted at and spat on, deprived of sleep and provided little, substandard food, the report found.
“Conditions at the Shikma facility are an inherent part of interrogations there: They serve to weaken both mind and body, complementing the actual interrogation of detainees in the interrogation room,” the report said. “The combination of conditions both in and outside the interrogation room constitutes abuse and inhuman, degrading treatment, at times even amounting to torture.”
Israeli agencies are bound by a Supreme Court’s 1999 prohibition on torture and work under legal supervision. Far more serious abuses of detainees are rampant in other countries across the region.
The report comes as Israel struggles to cope with months of near-daily Palestinian attacks on civilians and security forces.
The rights groups’ report was based on affidavits and personal accounts from Palestinians held for security reasons at the facility between August 2013 and March 2014. The prisoners interviewed spent a maximum of 58 days in detention.
The Shin Bet called the report “twisted.” It said interrogations are conducted according to law in order to prevent attacks and “activities that damage the security of the country.”
