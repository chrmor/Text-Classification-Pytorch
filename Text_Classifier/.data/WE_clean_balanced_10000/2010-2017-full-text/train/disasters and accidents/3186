Strong quake strikes Northern Mariana Islands
A strong earthquake happened close to Agrihan, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, at about 7:18 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake had a magnitude of 7.7 and was located 19 miles south-southwest of the island, and about 131 miles deep. It was felt as farÂ south as Guam.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, based in Hawaii, has acknowledged the quake, but issued a statement saying there is no tsunami threat because the quake was very deep in the earth. No warnings have been issued.
As of 8:20 a.m, an hour after the quake, there had been no reports of damage or injuries, according to the commonwealth's Emergency Management Office.
According to the Geological Survey, deep quakes cause less damage on the surface than shallow quakes, but strong deep quakes, like this one, can be felt at greater distances.
