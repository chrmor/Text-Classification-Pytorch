Westlife singer Shane Filan declared bankrupt in UK
The Westlife singer Shane Filan has become the latest victim of the Irish property bubble after being declared bankrupt in the UK.
The 32-year-old, whose boyband career saw him share in the group's estimated £31m fortune, said he was devastated by the move, which happened just days before Westlife play their farewell show in Dublin.
Filan's announcement came as an Irish couple who amassed an £800m international property portfolio started bankruptcy proceedings in London on Thursday.
Filan was declared bankrupt this week at Kingston county court in Surrey, a month after his Ireland-based property development company went into receivership. The bankruptcy order lasts for a year but would have lasted for three years had it been filed in Ireland.
Filan said in a statement that he had been forced to make the move after exhausting all other options. "Together with a team of financial and legal experts I have spent months exploring all possible alternatives to bankruptcy but to no avail. I have worked long and hard to try to reduce my debts, and I am devastated that it came to this conclusion.
"I now intend to focus on the remaining dates of the Westlife tour and my commitments to the band before looking to rebuild a future for my wife, my three children and myself."
Westlife, currently on their final tour, have had 14 No 1 singles in the UK, including Flying Without Wings and Fool Again, and more than two dozen top 10 hits. In 2010, the group were estimated to have amassed a £31m fortune after selling more than 44m records. The group will wind up their 14-year career with a show at Croke Park in Dublin on 23 June.
