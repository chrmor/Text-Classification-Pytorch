Deportivo pin hopes on Paciência
RC Deportivo La Coruña have announced that Portuguese coach Domingos Paciência will take charge of the Liga strugglers until the end of the season following José Luis Oltra's dismissal late on Sunday.
Oltra took the Galician club back into the Spanish top flight last season with a record points haul in the second division but, having won just two of their 17 Liga outings this season, the Blanquiazules are bottom of the Liga.
"We consider this an apt moment for us [to change coach]," said club president Augusto César Lendoiro, who confirmed Paciência would take over for the remainder of the campaign.
"It's something of great pride to coach this team," said Paciência at the press conference to confirm his appointment. "I'm very keen to achieve the objective of maintaining our Liga status. [To do that] we will need balance on the pitch; the team must know when to attack and when to defend. Everyone will need to be fully committed."
A former FC Porto and Portugal international striker, Paciência – who left Sporting Clube de Portugal in February – took charge of UD Leira and A. Académica de Coimbra before moving to SC Braga, whom he led to a UEFA Europa League final appearance against Porto in 2011. The 43-year old's first game in charge of his new team will be Saturday's Liga meeting at home to Málaga CF.
