India bus crash in Himachal Pradesh 'kills 18'
Eighteen people were killed when a bus they were travelling in plunged off a mountain road in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, police said.
Fourteen people were also injured when the private bus fell into a gorge in Sirmaur district early on Friday. The police said the toll could rise.
The bus, with 36 people, was travelling between Punardhar and Solan towns.
Road accidents are common in India, often due to poor driving or badly maintained roads and vehicles.
In April, 12 people were killed when their vehicle fell into a gorge in Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh.
And in March, 37 people were killed when a bus careered off a bridge in the western state of Maharashtra.
