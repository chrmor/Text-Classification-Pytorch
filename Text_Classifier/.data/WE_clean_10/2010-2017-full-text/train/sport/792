Olympiacos cut ties with coach Jardim
Olympiacos FC have dismissed coach Leonardo Jardim, with his assistant Antonis Nikopolidis taking temporary charge for the Greek Super League match at home to PAS Giannina FC on Sunday. 
Jardim, formerly of SC Braga, filled the vacancy left by Ernesto Valverde in June, but has lasted just six months of his two-year contract. Nikopolidis inherits a side unbeaten in the league and ten points clear of PAOK FC at the summit.
One of the heroes of Greece's unexpected UEFA EURO 2004 triumph, former goalkeeper Nikopolidis retired 18 months ago and is poised to make his coaching debut. 
Olympaicos, who finished third behind FC Schalke 04 and Arsenal FC in UEFA Champions League Group B, face Levante UD in the UEFA Europa League round of 32 on 14 and 21 February. Should they progress, a last-16 tie against either Club Atlético de Madrid or FC Rubin Kazan awaits.
