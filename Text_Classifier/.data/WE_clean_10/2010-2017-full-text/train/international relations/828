India, Pakistan to set up terror hotline on militants
India and Pakistan have decided to set up a hotline to better 'real time information sharing' on terrorist threats, said a joint statement released after the two countries' home secretaries talked on Tuesday.
It stated Pakistan has also agreed in-principle to entertain a commission from India to interrogate 26/11 suspects held in that country.
The date of visit for the judicial commission from Pakistan to visit India will be conveyed by India within four to six weeks, the statement said.
India's NIA and Pakistan's FIA will continue to cooperate in the Mumbai attack's probe, it added.
India also provided information on the Samjhauta Express blast probe. It was agreed that India will share updated information with Pakistan in future.
