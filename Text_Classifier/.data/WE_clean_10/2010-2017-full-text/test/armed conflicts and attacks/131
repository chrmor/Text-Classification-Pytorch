At least 14 dead in Ivory Coast ethnic clashes
At least 14 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in the western Ivory Coast city of Duekoue, a United Nations official said on Thursday declining to make a link with the presidential crisis in Abidjan.
"Over the last three days, inter-ethnic violence has taken over Duekoue following the death of a woman during a robbery," the UN mission in Ivory Coast's human rights spokesman Simon Munzu told journalists.
"At least 14 people have been killed" during clashes between members of the Guere and Malinke ethnic groups in the city around 500 kilometres west of the commercial capital Abidjan, he said.
UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said Wednesday that he was worried about an eruption of ethnic fighting in Ivory Coast's western Liberian border, saying it was "the start of conflict in the west".
The UN says at least 210 people have been killed in the Ivory Coast unrest since mid-December.
