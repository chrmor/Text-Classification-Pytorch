Toronto, October 17 Fauja Singh, a 100-year-old runner of Indian-origin has set a new Guinness record of being the oldest person to complete a full-distance marathon here.
It took Fauja Singh over eight hours to cross the finish line, more than six hours after Kenya�s Kenneth Mungara won the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon yesterday for the fourth straight year.
Fauja Singh was the last competitor to complete the course but entered the Guinness Book of World Records.
He accomplished the amazing feat, becoming the oldest person ever to complete a full-distance 42-km marathon. Singh, who only speaks Punjabi, also surprised himself.
Through his interpreter, he said he had set a goal of finishing the race in about nine hours. �Beating his original prediction, he�s overjoyed,� his coach and translator Harmander Singh was quoted as saying by the Toronto Star.� PTI
