Hurricane Joaquin a threat to the Island
Hurricane Joaquin has weakened to a Category 3 storm but remains a threat to the Island, according to the Bermuda Weather Service.
A hurricane watch and small craft warning are in effect as the storm heads northeast after lashing the central islands of the Bahamas with sustained winds of 125 miles per hour.
In its midnight update, the National Hurricane Centre said the storm was about 765 miles southwest of Bermuda and moving northeast at 10mph. This motion was expected to continue, with a gradual increase in forward speed over the next 48 hours.
The Bermuda Weather Services midnight update predicted Joaquins closest point to the Island would be within 126 nautical miles to the west at 11pm on Sunday night.
Hurricane Joaquin will begin to make its presence felt with winds beginning to strengthen in the early hours of Saturday morning, with stronger gusts developing Saturday night and an increased possibility of showers in the vicinity, said a Bermuda Weather Service forecaster, Andrew Read. At this stage, heavier showers are less likely.
Ahead of the hurricane, thunderstorms and more significant showers could develop shortly after midnight on Saturday and intensify over the course of Sunday.
According to the National Hurricane Centre, the storm decreased in strength slightly as the eye passed near San Salvador.
Data from a reconnaissance plane indicated that maximum sustained winds last night were 125mph with higher gusts.
Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 50 miles from the centre and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles.
