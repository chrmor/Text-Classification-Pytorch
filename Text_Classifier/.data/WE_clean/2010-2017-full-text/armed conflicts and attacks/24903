ISIS, in a First, Says It Was Behind Attack in Syrian Capital
GAZIANTEP, Turkey — The Islamic State claimed its first attack inside the Syrian capital on Tuesday, asserting responsibility for a car bomb that destroyed a police officers’ club and left several people dead and dozens wounded.
The bombing, witnesses and regional news reports said, struck Masaken Barzeh, a neighborhood on the northern edge of the city that had been largely secure and quiet. Within hours the Islamic State, using its official media channels, said it had orchestrated the blast. The Islamic State had said it was behind an assault last month on the Sayeda Zeinab shrine on the outskirts of the capital that left dozens dead.
The blast on Tuesday came amidgovernment advances against insurgents in northern Syria, a signal that even as the leadership goes on the offensive in some parts of the country, government-controlled areas, including those believed to be secure, remain vulnerable.
