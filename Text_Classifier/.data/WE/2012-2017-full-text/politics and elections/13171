John Kerry Suffers Broken Leg in Bike Accident in France
Secretary of State John Kerry suffered a broken leg in a bike accident in France early Sunday and will return to the U.S. for treatment, the State Department said.
The cycling accident occurred near Scionzier, France, about 25 miles from Geneva, where Kerry had been holding nuclear talks with Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif.
Kerry was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Geneva. He was reported stable and in good spirits.
State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry had suffered a broken femur but was expected to make a full recovery. Kerry had planned to fly back Sunday evening to the U.S., but doctors decided it was "sensible" for him to remain in the hospital for observation overnight and fly home Monday, Kirby said.
He said Kerry never lost consciousness and was grateful to the French and Swiss doctors and nurses who assisted him. Paramedics and a physician were in Kerry's motorcade at the time of the accident, Kirby said.
Kerry had been due to head to Madrid on Sunday for talks with Spain's king and prime minister before attending a meeting in Paris on Tuesday with coalition members battling ISIS.
Kirby said Kerry was planning to take part in Tuesday's meeting remotely.
