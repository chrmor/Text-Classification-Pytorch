100,000 in Spain anti-crisis protest
More than 100,000 protesters took to the streets in Spain on Sunday blaming bankers and politicians for causing a financial crisis that forced the country to adopt painful spending cuts.
Demonstrators of all ages linked to a movement called the "indignants" also protested against crippling unemployment and a failure to take on government corruption.
The El Mundo newspaper, quoting police sources, said as many 40,000 protesters flooded streets in Madrid.
In Barcelona, the nation's second-largest city, police said 50,000 people turned out, while groups of several thousand demonstrators rallied in other cities.
Protesters assembled in several neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Madrid early on Sunday, then formed six columns and converged on the city centre.
They tried to gather at parliament but were stopped by police, who had set up barricades and used 12 vans to block several major roads.
