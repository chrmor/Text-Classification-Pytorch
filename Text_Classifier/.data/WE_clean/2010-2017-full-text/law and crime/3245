WikiLeaks: Tony Blair recalled to give more evidence to the Iraq inquiry
Tony Blair is to be hauled back before the Iraq Inquiry over fresh allegations that he ignored warnings the invasion was illegal.
In an explosive development, the former prime minister was named at the top of a list of people to be recalled next month for a second grilling in London.
The move is a blow to Mr Blair, who is trying to put controversy over the 2003 war behind him.
It is believed to relate to fresh documents showing that the then Attorney General Lord Goldsmith warned Mr Blair on January 30, 2003 that a second UN resolution was needed to legalise war.
A scribbled note next to this sentence, apparently in Mr Blair’s handwriting, says: 'I just don’t understand this.'
He reportedly told George Bush the next day that he was 'solidly' with him as the U.S. president said the bombing of Iraq was planned to begin in mid-March 2003.
During his previous six-hour interview in January, Mr Blair angered some relatives of British troops killed in Iraq by refusing to express regret over the invasion.
Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot had to call for quiet after he was heckled from the public gallery. People shouted 'liar' and 'murderer' as he left.
Taxpayers, meanwhile, were landed with a £273,000 bill for security to protect the multi-millionaire.
Last night the Stop the War Coalition pledged to 'pursue him to the end of his days'.
'Wherever Tony Blair goes, we will go until the establishment sees fit to try him for his crimes,' a spokesman said.
'We will give him a very warm welcome, just as we mobilised protests against his last appearance.'
Sir John said: 'As we draft our report, it is clear there are areas where we need further detail.'
Others to be recalled include former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Lord Goldsmith.
The committee has been studying the 400,000 secret documents on the conduct of the war published last month by whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks.
Sources have also made clear that chairman Sir John Chilcot has studied Mr Blair's memoir, A Journey, for further explanations of his decisions. 
It is likely the inquiry will want to quiz Mr Blair more closely on his motives for going to war.
In his memoirs he admitted that the decision troubled him, saying he was 'desperately sorry' over the deaths it caused, which contradicted that stance he took while giving evidence.
No date has been set for Mr Blair's second appearance, which has been set down for half a day.
There will be another public ballot for the 60 seats in the hearing room and a third of the places will be set aside for the relatives of those killed in the war.
The inquiry has also requested written evidence from former defence procurement ministers Lord Drayson and Lord Bach and officials including Mr Straw's ex-special adviser Lord Williams of Baglan, former vice chief of the defence staff Air Chief  Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall and ex-Foreign Office head of news John Williams.
This evidence will be published on the inquiry's website unless there are exceptional reasons, such as protecting national security, not to do so.
As well as its public evidence sessions, the inquiry committee has heard from more than 30 witnesses in private.
Edited transcripts of some of these closed hearings will be published in the new year.
The panel is now hard at work completing its final report.
Sir John said: 'My colleagues and I remain committed to producing a full and frank report based on the evidence we have before us.
'We are independent of government and will not shy away from criticising if we find fault or if we conclude that errors have been made. We are determined to produce a report that will be useful to future governments.
'Writing it will take time but we will finish our work as soon as possible and present it to the Prime Minister for debate in Parliament within the coming months.'
