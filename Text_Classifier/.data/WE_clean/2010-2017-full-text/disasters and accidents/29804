Deadly Winter Storm Niko Buries Northeast; Schools Remain Closed Friday
Thursday, 59-year-old Miguel Gonzalez died while shoveling snow on the Upper East Side of New York, CBS New York reports. Authorities say the doorman slipped and crashed through a plate glass window around 9:30 a.m. He was taken to Metropolitan Hospital with injuries to the neck and face and was later pronounced dead.
Snow emergencies were declared in two major Northeast metro areas, Philadelphia and Boston, as the rapidly strengthening storm blanketed the Northeast with up to 2 feet of snow in places.  Thundersnow was also reported at several locations around the region. 
Governors in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio urged people to stay off the roads Thursday, the Associated Press reports, to keep them clear for plows and emergency vehicles. Despite the warnings, the rapid accumulation of snow caught many drivers out in the open. 
"It's pretty nuts here," Felecia White told the Associated Press as she and friends hunkered down in a restaurant in Newport, Rhode Island, waiting for the weather to improve. "Even with four-wheel drive, you can't do anything. You can't see across the street."
Connecticut State Police responded to more than 600 calls during the storm, including 68 accidents with four injuries and several jackknifed semi trucks that closed stretches of Interstate 95. New Jersey State Police reduced speed limits to 35 mph along the 122-mile length of the New Jersey Turnpike but still fielded more 600 calls for assistance.
In New York, dozens of motorists were stranded on Long Island after they couldn't make it up icy ramps, and scores of others were around the NYC Metro area, the Associated Press reports. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo himself stopped to give aid to a driver stuck in a snowbank in Westchester County, helping to attach tow cables from his security detail's SUV onto the man's car.
