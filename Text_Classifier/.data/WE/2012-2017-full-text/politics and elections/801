U.S. & World Population Clocks
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the equivalent of Eastern Standard Time (EST) plus 5 hours or Eastern Daylight Saving Time (EDT) plus 4 hours.
Note: The U.S. POPClock is consistent with Census 2010 data and the most recent national population estimates.
Population clocks on the US Census Bureau's Web site will update continuously for one minute and then will update once per minute after the first minute a web page is displayed.
See the Detailed POPClock Pages for more information:
