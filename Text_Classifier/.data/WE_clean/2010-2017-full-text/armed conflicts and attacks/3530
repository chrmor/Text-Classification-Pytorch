Blast at Swiss embassy in Rome injures one
A package bomb exploded at the Swiss embassy in Rome on Thursday, seriously wounding one, according to reports.
The Italian interior ministry said a man seriously injured both of this hands when he went to open the package. He was taken to hospital for surgery as police gathered at the scene.
"Investigations are ongoing but I can recall, without attributing any responsibility, some episodes of a similar nature in the recent past," said Swiss Ambassador to Rome, Bernardino Regazzoni. He recalled an anarchist group had launched a campaign on the internet recently, announcing its actions. A bomb also exploded at the Chiliean embassy in Rome, injuring one. Police were investigating a suspicious package that had arrived at the Ukrainian embassy as well.
Other embassies in the Italian capital went on high-alert. The Germans expressed their sympathies with the injured Swiss, a 53-year-old mail worker. The Italians called it “a deplorable act of violence” against the Swiss. Specialists were combing for evidence but could not yet say who was responsible.
The explosion happened two days after a rudimentary device with wires and powder was discovered on an empty underground train, also in Rome. Police said that device turned out to be a fake, with neither a detonator nor explosives.
There have been growing concerns in Europe about holiday season attacks following a suicide bombing in Sweden.
