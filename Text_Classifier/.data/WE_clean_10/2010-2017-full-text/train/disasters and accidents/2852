Italy fireworks factory blast kills seven
At least seven people have been killed in a huge explosion at a fireworks factory near Italy's southern city of Bari, local media say.
Reports say several people were injured - some seriously - at the Bruscella factory in the town of Modugno.
The first blast reportedly triggered a series of explosions and a fire, which is threatening a nearby forest.
Firefighters and ambulance crews are now at the scene. The cause of the blast is being investigated.
The factory was said to have been busy preparing fireworks as many Italian towns celebrate festivals at this time of the year.
