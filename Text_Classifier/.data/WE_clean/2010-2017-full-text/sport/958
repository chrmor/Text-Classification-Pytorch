England blind team finish fourth in world championship
England bowed out of the World Blind Football Championship with a 1-0 defeat as China clinched third place through a Ya Feng Wang goal at Hereford.
Wang, a constant threat for the visitors, slotted home from close range to put his side ahead before the break.
Dave Clarke and Jon Gribben went close as Tony Larkin's side pushed for the equaliser, but China held on to win.
Brazil scored either side of half-time in the final to beat Spain 2-0 and lift the trophy for a third time.
Wang, who was named as the young player of the tournament after the final, was only denied by last-ditch challenges from Clarke and Keryn Seal before opening the scoring against England.
A fine save from Lewis Skyers prevented him adding another in the second half, but the hosts could not find a way through a packed defence at the other end.
"We were unlucky not to finish up with a medal," said coach Larkin.
"We are a young side and finishing fourth in a World Cup is fantastic achievement for everyone involved."
Alves and player of the tournament Goncalves found the net for Brazil as they beat the competition's only other undefeated side in the final.
