21 dead at Radison Blu hotel in Mali
(CNN)Heavily armed gunmen on Friday fired indiscriminately at guests at a hotel hosting diplomats and others in Mali's capital, the maître d' told CNN.
At least 21 people were killed in the attack in which an al Qaeda-affiliated group is taking partial responsibility.
"These people started shooting. They were shooting at everybody without asking a single question. They were shooting at anything that moved," Tamba Couye said of the attack at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako.
One man did yell "Allahu akbar," said Couye, who was working in the restaurant where breakfast was underway. The attackers sounded like they were from northern Mali, he told "Erin Burnett OutFront."
Couye said an attacker chased him from the hotel but he came back later to help because his instincts told him he needed to do so to save lives.
The Radisson Blu Hotel is in an upscale neighborhood outside the center of Bamako, rising high above the dusty streets and surrounding houses. With 190 rooms and suites, it is known as a hub for international guests such as diplomats and businesspeople, and it is a 15-minute drive from Bamako-Senou International Airport.
• One U.S. citizen was killed, a senior State Department official told CNN. "We express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. ... Out of respect for the family, we have no further information at this time." OfAnita Datar, her brother Sanjeev Datar, said. "Everything she did in her life she did to help others -- as a mother, public health expert, daughter, sister and friend."
At the time, the Malian army said the attackers were affiliated with the Macina Liberation Movement. Human Rights Watch has described the group as Islamists who commit "serious abuses in the course of military operations against Mali's security forces."
