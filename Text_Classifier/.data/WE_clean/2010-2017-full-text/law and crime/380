Atomic whistle-blower Vanunu exits prison, asks to leave country -  Haaretz - Israel News
Nuclear whistle-blower Mordechai Vanunu was released from prison yesterday after serving a 10-week sentence at the Ayalon Prison for violating the terms of his parole.
Upon his release, Vanunu asked that he be allowed to leave the country, saying that he had been a mere technician at the Dimona nuclear plant and had no knowledge about atomic weapons.
Vanunu said he hoped the prime minister and the head of the Shin Bet security service and the Mossad would solve what he called their problem of his frequent arrests, by allowing him to leave the country.
Vanunu's brother Meir criticized the fact that he was kept separate from other prisoners.
Vanunu served 18 years in prison for revealing secrets about the Dimona nuclear facility to The Sunday Times in 1986. In 2004, he was charged with violating the terms of his parole and sentenced to six months in jail, which was reduced to three months on appeal and later exchanged for community service. Vanunu petitioned the High Court of Justice to allow him to do his service in East Jerusalem out of fear for his life if he worked among Israelis, but authorities in charge of community service sentences objected and therefore he was ordered to serve his sentence, which was further reduced.
