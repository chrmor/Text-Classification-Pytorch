Venezuela quitting OAS in anger at pressure over political crisis
Venezuela said on Wednesday it was quitting the Organisation of American States in anger at pressure from the bloc over the government's handling of the country's political crisis.
"Tomorrow we will present a letter of complaint to the OAS and we will begin a process that will take 24 months" to pull Venezuela out of the Washington-based regional diplomatic grouping, Delcy Rodriguez, the foreign minister, said in a televised address.
