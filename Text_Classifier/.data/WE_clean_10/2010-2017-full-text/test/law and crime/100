Iris Robinson's lover, Kirk McCambley, becomes instant gay pin-up
Iris Robinson’s young lover Kirk McCambley has become an unlikely icon for the gay community.
Members of the homosexual community were left outraged when Mrs Robinson described their behaviour as “an abomination”.
The UK’s best-selling gay magazine Attitude has asked the 21-year-old to pose on the next edition of its front cover.
Attitude editor Matthew Todd revealed his magazine has been trying to contact Mr McCambley.
He said: “We would love to see him on the cover of Attitude. We think our readers would go wild for him.”
Devout-Christian Mrs Robinson embarked on the extramarital affair in the summer of 2008 while making a series of homophobic comments in the media.
One posting on Pink News, Europe’s largest gay news service, states “going on the picture here, there's no denying that he's a very good looking lad”. Another says: “Attitude want Kirk as their next cover boy!!!! Please make this happen!!!”
There are also dozens of comments from members of the gay community on an array of social network sites urging Mr McCambley to contact them.
Mr McCambley has also attracted thousands of fans on Facebook thanks to the Kirk McCambley Appreciation Society. Set up on Thursday, it already has more than 3,629 members.
Online campaigns have also been launched to get the Belfast businessman into Celebrity Big Brother 7 and Simon & Garfunkel’s hit song Mrs Robinson to number one in a Rage Against The Machine style download drive.
