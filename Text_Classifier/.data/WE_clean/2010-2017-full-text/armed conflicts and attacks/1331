Man pleads not guilty to Danish hotel blast charges
A man arrested in connection with a small blast at a hotel in Copenhagen has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges and putting lives at risk.
Earlier, police used a remote-controlled robot to remove a package from around his waist.
The Danish intelligence chief said it was not clear but circumstances pointed to a failed terror attack.
Islamist militants consider Denmark a target since cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad were published there in 2005.
Denmark is now on a heightened state of alert.
Speaking through an interpreter in French, the man told the court he could not remember his name or age.
He appeared in court on crutches, with the lower part of his right leg missing, and was remanded in custody until 4 October.
The blast occurred in a toilet of the Jorgensons hotel, a short distance from Norreport Station.
Denmark was already on alert because of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
"Regardless of the background for the bomb detonation, it is important that we don't allow ourselves to be guided by fear or change the way we live," Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement.
