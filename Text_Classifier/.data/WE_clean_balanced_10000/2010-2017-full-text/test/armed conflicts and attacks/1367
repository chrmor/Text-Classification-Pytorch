IDF kills 2 terrorists on Gaza border
Two terrorists from south Gaza were killed by Israeli soldiers overnight Sunday while attempting to plant explosive devices along the security fence.
The IDF said soldiers and a helicopter gunship opened fire on the group of terrorists. According to the army, two terrorists were killed in the incident.
Army officials said that at around 2 am three terrorists were spotted by soldiers manning an observation point as they were approaching the security fence in south Gaza, near the Suffa crossing.
The condition of the third terrorist remains unclear.
The army estimates that Gaza's terror groups will continue to try and attack Israeli soldiers along the border fence and may even attempt large, more complex attacks.
In early December two terrorists were shot dead while approaching the security fence.
A recent flare-up along the border has threatened the calm that has largely held since Israel invaded Gaza two years ago to try to stop years of Palestinian rocket fire.
Nearly 30 rockets and mortars have been fired toward Israel over the past week, causing no serious injuries. The Air Force hit back with multiple airstrikes on various targets in the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave. In the most recent strike, two Palestinians, apparently from Hamas, were injured.
On Saturday, Gaza's Hamas rulers warned they would escalate hostilities against Israel if tensions don't subside along the Gaza-Israel border.
"There is a truce in effect in the field. It is real if Israel stops its aggression and ends its siege. But if there is any Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip we will respond strongly," said a masked spokesman for Hamas' armed wing who identified himself as Abu Obeideh.
Speaking at a press conference with three guards, who were all masked and armed, he said the group was ready to repel any future Israeli invasion and hinted at a secret weapon.
"We are completely ready to answer any Israeli aggression," he said. "Our weapons are few compared to those of the Israeli occupation, but we have something that will worry the occupation," he said without giving details.
