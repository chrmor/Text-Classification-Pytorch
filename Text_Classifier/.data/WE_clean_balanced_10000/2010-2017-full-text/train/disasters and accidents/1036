Queensland braces for heavy rain as Cyclone Marcia hits
Queenslanders are being warned to stock up on supplies as latest weather warnings show Tropical Cyclone Marcia is set to make landfall within 24 hours.
Warnings issued by the Bureau of Meteorology at 4am Thursday said the cyclone was expected to strengthen as it headed toward the coast and was expected to hit as a category two system.
It is expected to cross the coast early Friday between Bundaberg and St Lawrence, according to the bureau, and bring destructive winds, flooding and as much as two months' rain in a day to the state's south east.
The bureau warns the cyclone is moving quickly through the Coral Sea.
