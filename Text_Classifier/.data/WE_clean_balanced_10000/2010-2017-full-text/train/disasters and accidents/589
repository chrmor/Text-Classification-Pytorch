Plague breaks out in China's Tibet
China issued a health alert in its southwestern region of Tibet after five people were diagnosed with the plague, an often fatal infectious disease.
One of the five has already died from a severe lung infection attributed to the pneumonic plague, while one other patient was in a critical condition, the Tibet health department said in a statement on its website on Sunday.
The outbreak was first detected on Thursday last week in Latok village in Tibet's Nyingchi Prefecture, the department said.
The four patients, all of whom had contact with the deceased, have been quarantined, it said.
Disease control experts have been dispatched to the area in an effort to control the further spread of the disease, it said.
The department also issued a warning to anyone who has visited the region near the outbreak to seek immediate medical attention should they develop fever, cough or other flu-like symptoms common to the plague.
