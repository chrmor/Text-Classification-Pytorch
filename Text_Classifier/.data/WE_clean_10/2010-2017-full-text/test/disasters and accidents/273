Twenty-seven bodies have been identified, and search operations have ended because rescuers think all the victims have been found, authorities said.
"Bodies are scattered all over the sloppy hill, so security personnel are having difficulties collecting bodies and rescuing the victims," Sharma said.
The bus fell more than 300 meters (about 985 feet) down the hill.
"It is a narrow, gravel road," Panthi said. "We are looking into the possibility of overcrowding of the bus being the cause of accident. We can come to a final conclusion only after the investigation is over."
