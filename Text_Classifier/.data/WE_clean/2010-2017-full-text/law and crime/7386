China: Media Coverage of a Study Embarrasses Party
A media storm over corrupt officials is embarrassing China’s Communist Party as it prepares to celebrate its 90th birthday on July 1. The news coverage has focused on a study circulating on the Internet claiming that corrupt officials have fled the country with more than $100 billion since the mid-1990s, mainly to the United States. It is unclear who wrote the 71-page study, which is marked “internal material” but has no author, letterhead or other identifying features. It was reported to have been posted on the Web site of the People’s Bank of China. It remains online, but not on the bank’s Web site.
