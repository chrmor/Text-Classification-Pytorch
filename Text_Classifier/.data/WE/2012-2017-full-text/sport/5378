Reading fires manager Brian McDermott

LONDON (AP) â€” Reading fired manager Brian McDermott on Monday in an attempt to preserve the team's Premier League status.
A fourth successive loss on Saturday left next-to-last Reading four points from safety and only off the bottom of the standings because it has scored more goals than Queens Park Rangers.
"In our current situation, owner Anton Zingarevich felt that a change was necessary," Reading said in a statement.
The 51-year-old McDermott had been in charge since 2009 and took the team into the topflight for the start of this season for only the second time in its 142-year history.
But the Russian-owned team is at risk of dropping out of the Premier League after only one season and missing out on sharing the wealth from a new TV deal worth about $8 billion across three years from August.
Reading has nine games left this season and is yet to replace McDermott, who won the Premier League manager of the month award in January.
"The search for a successor will start immediately, and it is hoped that a new manager will be in place as soon as possible to lead the fight against potential relegation," Reading said.
McDermott has been part of the backroom staff at the club, which is based west of London, since 2000. After taking temporary control of the team in December 2009 he was given the job on a full-time basis a month later.
Unlike relegation rival QPR, Reading failed to invest heavily in the January transfer window.
McDermott's final match on Saturday saw his players surrender the lead to lose 2-1 at home to fellow struggler Aston Villa.
Reading's next two games are against leader Manchester United on Saturday and fifth-place Arsenal.
