CMPD Investigating Fatal Officer Involved Shooting at Northlake Mall
CHARLOTTE --Charlotte- Mecklenburg Police spent all Thursday night interviewing witnesses after a deadly, officer-involved shooting on Christmas Eve inside the Northlake mall. 
Daquan Westbrook, 18, was killed during the shooting
It was reported around 2:20 p.m. Thursday outside of the Journey's store on the mall's lower level. Police say Westbrook started shooting a gun during an altercation between two groups of people.
Officer Thomas Ferguson, who was working off-duty security at the mall, responded quickly to the scene. Witnesses say Westbrook pointed his weapon at the officer, who then fired his service weapon.
Westbrook was pronounced dead at the scene. None of the responding officers were hurt.
During a news conference, CMPD Chief Kerr Putney said there is no indication that the shooting was gang-related, though there is information that it was part of an ongoing dispute.
Chief Putney said there were multiple weapons found at the scene.
A witness who works at a store in the mall says she heard about 10 shots fired and then people began running. She and her coworkers escaped the mall through a back exit and into the parking lot. 
Traffic around the mall became hectic as people fled the mall and emergency crews responded. Shoppers in the packed mall said it was a chaotic scene as people ran for exits, many afraid of being trampled by the crowds.
"The immediate thing that happened when I fell, when the people fell in front of me and I fell was, 'Oh, this is it. The stampede. We're going to get crushed running out of here.' Luckily my son was there with me," said shopper Kelly Thurston.
"It was chaotic...the first shot didn't sound like a gunshot until it was repetitive....Probably at least, I'd say, 10 to 15 shots. So when everybody realized it was gunshots, everybody started running at the same time. People were falling. My mom tripped over somebody in front [of] her that fell, and lost her phone and her keys. That's why we're still here. And it was just crazy. I had to pick her up and carry her out of the mall. It was crazy. It was like a stampede," said witness Bryce Hawkins.
Medic says one person was treated for a leg injury, another person had an asthma attack and a woman in the mall went into labor. 
The FBI is part of the investigation, and the off-duty officer is now on administrative leave, as is standard procedure.
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call CMPD at 704-336-7600 or call 911.
