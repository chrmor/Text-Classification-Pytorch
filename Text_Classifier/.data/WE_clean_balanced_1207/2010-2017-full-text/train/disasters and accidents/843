Several Deaths In Tornadoes That Swept Through Mass. « CBS Boston
BOSTON (CBS) — Peter Judge of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency confirms there were at least four deaths in Wednesday’s tornadoes.
Gov. Deval Patrick had said during a news conference just before 8 p.m. that he knew of at least one death in West Springfield, when a car overturned.
MEMA officials later confirmed two fatalities occurred in West Springfield, one in Springfield and one in Brimfield. Early reports from MEMA of two deaths in Westfield were incorrect.
Tornado touchdowns were confirmed in a number of communities, including Westfield, Springfield, West Springfield, Brimfield, Wilbraham, Sturbridge, Monson, Oxford, Charlton, and Agawam.
In a second news conference, this time from the MEMA bunker in Framingham, Gov. Patrick asked people to give search and rescue teams and assessment teams a chance to do their jobs Wednesday night and Thursday. He said there is lots of tree damage, debris on roads and live wires down.
He also encouraged people to check on their neighbors.
“We will do whatever we have to do to meet the needs of people to protect public safety,” said the governor.
