Dynegy Bankruptcy Examiner Finds Fraudulent Transfer
The report from the court-appointed examiner in the Dynegy bankruptcy case is out, and it’s a bombshell.
As I’ve noted in earlier columns, the Dynegy case has been distinguished from inception by hardball tactics that the parent company shareholders have used to try to salvage some value, after their earlier attempts for a merger or takeover failed.
On Friday, the examiner – Susheel Kirpalani, a well-respected bankruptcy lawyer — concluded that:
the conveyance of CoalCo to Dynegy Inc. was an actual fraudulent transfer and, assuming that Dynegy Holdings was insolvent on the date of the transfer (approximately two months before the bankruptcy filing), a constructive fraudulent transfer, and a breach of fiduciary duty by the board of directors of Dynegy Holdings.
The fraudulence conveyance finding means that Dynegy Holdings can sue its non-bankrupt parent company to undo the transfer. The breach of fiduciary duty claim would give the debtor the right to sue the parent company board members for damages – presumably at least equal to the value lost in the transaction.
This scrambles the planned confirmation hearing in the case. Indeed, the debtor parts of Dynegy will have to consider whether their plan remains viable – Chapter 11 requires that every objecting creditor obtain at least as much as they would in Chapter 7. A majority can’t consent to less. With some viable causes of action against its own board, Dynegy Holdings will have to see if it still meets this test.
Moreover, the Dynegy Holdings board may have to be revamped if the debtor wants to avoid appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. Right now, many members of the Dynegy Holdings board are the very people who Dynegy Holdings is supposed to sue.
