Judge orders release of Steven Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey in 'Making a Murderer' case
UPDATE: U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin granted a motion for release in the Brendan Dassey case. Attorney General Brad Schimel intends to file an emergency motion in the Seventh Circuit seeking a stay of this release order.
A federal judge has ordered the release of Brendan Dassey.
"It is therefore ordered that Dassey's motion for release...is granted," part of the ruling released Monday reads.
The district court judge outlined several conditions for Dassey's release, including that he can only travel in the court's Eastern District of Wisconsin, not obtain a passport, not possess a gun or any other weapons, or possess any controlled substances.
Dassey also has been ordered not to have any contact with Steven Avery, or with the family of Teresa Halbach.
Earlier this year, a judge ruled that Dassey's conviction should be thrown out. The state has appealed that ruling, and Dassey's conviction could be reinstated by the state either winning that appeal or taking the case to a full retrial.
Dassey was convicted of several crimes in 2007 in connection with Halbach's death, including being party to first-degree intentional homicide, mutilation of a corpse, as well as second-degree sexual assault. His attorneys have argued their client's confession was unconstitutionally coerced.
