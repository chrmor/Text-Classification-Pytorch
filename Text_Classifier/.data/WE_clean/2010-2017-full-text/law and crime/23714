16 ISIS-Linked Suspects Held in Europe-Wide Sweep: Italy Officials
ROME â€” Sixteen ISIS-linked terrorist suspects have been arrested in a coordinated sweep by police across Europe, Italian police said Thursday.
The group is accused of using an online network to radicalize fighters to send to the Middle East, with the eventual aim of setting up a caliphate in Iraq's Kurdistan region.
It is also alleged to have planned an attack targeting Norwegian and British diplomats in the Middle East and plotted to kidnap other envoys in a bid to free their leader while he was imprisoned.
"This is the most important international police operation in Europe in 20 years," Italian anti-terrorism chief Giuseppe Governale told a news conference in Rome.
