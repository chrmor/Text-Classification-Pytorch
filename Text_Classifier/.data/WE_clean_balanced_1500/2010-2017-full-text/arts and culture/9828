History overturned as Anglican bishops are ordained as Catholic priests
In its 100-plus years Westminster Cathedral, the mother church of English Catholicism, will have seen few stranger sights than Saturday's procession of three Anglican bishops' wives, in matching beige coats, one with an outsized brown hat, going up on to the high altar to embrace their husbands, all newly ordained as Catholic priests. Catholicism isn't that keen on women on the altar – to the pain of the demonstrators from the Catholic Women's Ordination movement protesting outside the cathedral's doors – and it doesn't usually countenance priests having wives.
But this was no ordinary ceremony. Almost everyone who spoke during it used the word "historic" to describe the ordination as Catholic priests of John Broadhurst, Andrew Burnham and Keith Newton, all formerly Anglican bishops.
It is the Vatican's negative attitude to women's ministry that formed the backdrop to the whole affair. The three recruits oppose the Church of England's plans to appoint female bishops and regard the Catholic priesthood as a safe, female-free haven.
There has been a steady stream of converts since the Church of England voted in favour of female priests in 1992. What made the two-hour service in Westminster Cathedral genuinely historic, however, was that these three men were not simply joining the ranks of Britain's six million Catholics, or even being granted a special dispensation from Rome's usual rules to allow them to become married Catholic priests. That, too, has been happening in small numbers since 1992.
No, this whole ceremony, complete with 80 Catholic priests on the altar, plus six bishops, was a grand launch for Pope Benedict's new ringfenced section within Catholicism for Anglican dissenters. There has never been anything of its kind before. Its name was unveiled – the Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham – as well as the identity of its first leader, Father Newton. He will preside over a church within a church, where the normal rules of Catholicism don't apply. As well as a married priesthood, it can also use its own prayer books and rites, imported from Anglicanism.
What is breathtaking about the whole initiative is the speed at which 550 years of post-Reformation practice is being overturned. Until two weeks ago Broadhurst, Burnham and Newton were still Anglican bishops. In the space of 14 days, they have completed a journey that usually takes other converts seven years: 12 months to go through the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults to become a Catholic, and six years in a seminary.
Perhaps it was the sense that something was afoot in their church that had drawn so many to the neo-Byzantine cathedral. It was standing room only. Choirboys sang from up in the gods as the incense drifted into the upper reaches of the building.
Confronted by the heightened expectations, Archbishop Vincent Nichols, leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, did his best to inject a certain dignity and calm into proceedings. He was walking a difficult line between minimising the offence this ceremony would cause to Anglicans, including his good friend Rowan Williams, and doing what the pope wants.
In his homily, Nichols paid lavish tribute to Williams's "characteristic insight, and generosity of heart and spirit". His biggest challenge, however, was to present the ordination in record time of the three former Anglican bishops as doing a service to the cause of church unity. After all, it is hard to carry on saying that you respect the Anglican tradition and want to explore ways to work with it, up to and including eventual reunification, when at the same time you are offering special deals to woo dissident Church of England figures.
The new ordinariate, Nichols said, was intended by the pope "to contribute to the wider goal of visible unity between our two churches". Unless three Catholic bishops have plans to join the Church of England, it is hard to see quite how this notion of reciprocity works in practice.
Instead, it was hard to avoid concluding that what this ceremony really signalled was an end to the search for the compromises that would reunite two distinctive churches, and its replacement by Rome's scheme to gather up so many Anglican converts that the Church of England simply withers on the vine. A takeover, not a merger.
No one was saying that, but such is the confusion that surrounds the nature of the new ordinariate that anything is possible. At present, it has no offices, no church to worship in, very little money, and – it claims – a pile of applicants to process.
When it was first announced, Nichols assured me in an interview that the biggest take-up was likely to be among unhappy Anglicans in the US and Australia, yet here we are in London.
If many in the cathedral were puzzled, for the families of the three convert bishops in the front row there was at least clarity. No one would begrudge the pope extending a helping hand to men in the midst of a crisis of faith over the actions of their church. As they begin life as Catholic priests, though, even they probably have no real idea of whether, ultimately, they will be absorbed into the Catholic parish network or remain within the fortress of their ordinariate.
