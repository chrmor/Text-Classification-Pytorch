Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes divorcing after five years of marriage
"Rock of Ages" star Tom Cruise and his wife Katie Holmes are divorcing after five years of marriage, Fox News Channel confirms.
"This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family," Holmes' attorney Jonathan Wolfe said. "Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest." 
A rep for Cruise issued a statement saying that Holmes filed the divorce papers.
"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy to work this out," Amanda Lundberg said.
The news of the divorce was first reported by People magazine. 
Cruise, 49, and Holmes, 33, were married at an Italian castle in the fall of 2006 after a whirlwind romance that garnered major headlines for both stars. 
Cruise was widely mocked and panned for an appearance on the "Oprah Winfrey Show," where he jumped on a couch while emphatically declaring his love for the former "Dawson's Creek" actress in 2005.
"I can't be cool. I can't be laid-back," Cruise told Winfrey at the time. "Something happened and I want to celebrate it."
The couple's relationship continued to be a major source of public fascination over the next few years. After dating for just a few months, Cruise reportedly proposed to Holmes on top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Holmes often gushed about her husband, saying she dreamed of marrying him since she was a young girl.
But the seemingly fairytale romance was also plagued by reports that their marriage was a sham. Holmes often appeared on tabloid covers being portrayed as a victim or prisoner of the relationship. Holmes' conversion from Catholicism to Scientology also dominated headlines, as did young Suri's penchant for high heels and Starbucks.
This was Cruise’s third marriage. He was previously married to Nicole Kidman, with whom he has two children, and Mimi Rogers.  It was the first marriage for Holmes.
