Shiite Pilgrims Are Killed in Bus Attack in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Gunmen in the southwestern province of Baluchistan attacked a bus carrying Shiite pilgrims to Iran on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people and wounding 6 more, local police officials said.
The bus driver said that 8 to 10 attackers ordered the pilgrims off the bus and opened fire on them, the police said.
Hours later, the extremist Sunni group Lashkar-e-Jangvi claimed responsibility for the attack. The group, which the authorities say carried out previous attacks against Shiites in Baluchistan, is believed to be affiliated with Al Qaeda.
The attack occurred at Mastung, about 30 miles south of Quetta, the provincial capital, along the road to the Iran-Pakistan border crossing at Taftan. About 50 passengers were on the bus when it was attacked, said Saeed Imrani, the local deputy police commissioner.
Attacks on Shiite pilgrims traveling to Iran through Baluchistan have been frequent over the last decade. Two such attacks occurred last month. A year ago, 57 people at a Shiite rally in Quetta were killed by a suicide bomber.
Shiites are a minority in mainly Sunni Pakistan. Most of the Shiites in Baluchistan belong to the Hazara ethnic group, whose members are also numerous in Afghanistan and Iran. Shiites in Quetta complain that the local authorities have failed to provide adequate protection for them.
