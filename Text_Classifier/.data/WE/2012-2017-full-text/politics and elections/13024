North Korea cancels UN's Ban Ki-moon visit
Seoul: North Korea has cancelled an invitation to Ban Ki-moon to visit an industrial zone inside the isolated state, in an abrupt move the United Nations Secretary-General deplored as "deeply regrettable".
The decision comes after Ban this week urged North Korea to avoid any actions that might escalate military tensions, after it successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile.
Ban said North Korea had via "diplomatic channels" rescinded its invitation to the Kaesong zone, which is a key earner for the cash-strapped state but a perennial source of tension with South Korea.
"No explanation was given for this last-minute change," the UN chief, a former foreign minister of South Korea, told a forum in Seoul.
"This decision by Pyongyang is deeply regrettable."
