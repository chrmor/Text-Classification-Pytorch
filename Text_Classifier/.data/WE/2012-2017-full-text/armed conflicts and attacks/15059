ISIS Is Said to Have Killed 2 Activists in Turkey
Two Syrian activists who used video and social media to expose human rights abuses committed by the Islamic State were tracked down by jihadists and killed in their home in a southern Turkish city, according to their colleagues.
The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, released a graphic video claiming responsibility for their deaths on Sunday. The clip showed the body of one of the activists, his throat slit, along with a warning to the group’s opponents.
“You will never be safe from the blade of the Islamic State, and our hand will reach you wherever you are to slit your throat,” it said.
One of the men, Ibrahim Abdel Qader, was a co-founder of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, a group of citizen journalists and human rights activists that uses social media to document abuses committed by the jihadist group in Raqqa, the Syrian city it uses as its headquarters. The citizen-journalists are a primary source about life inside the ISIS capital.
The second man, Fares Hammadi, was a former member of the group who had left to work on human rights abuses across Syria as a whole, not just Raqqa, a spokesman for the group said.
