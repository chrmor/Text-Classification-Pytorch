E. coli recall affects major retailers across the U.S.
Contaminated celery from California-based Taylor Farms Pacific was found to be the source ofCostco's chicken salad recall last week. The Food and Drug Administration posted the company's recall of a range of food products that may also contain tainted celery.
The recall includes 155,000 items such as salad kits, vegetable trays and other prepared foods.
Among the stores involved are Walmart (WMT), Sams Club, Costco (COST), Albertsons (ABS), 7-Eleven, Target (TGT) and Safeway.
The products were primarily distributed in Western states, but stores in states including Georgia, Nebraska and Hawaii are also affected.
More than 45,000 Starbucks (SBUX) holiday turkey sandwiches distributed in California, Oregon and Nevada were also included.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 19 people were infected in seven states across the U.S. from eating Costco's chicken salad.
Officials are continuing to investigate the outbreak.
Chipotle (CMG) was also hit with an E. coli scare in early November.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that this recall had been expanded. In fact, the original recall has not been expanded.
