Philippines ferry: Death toll from capsized ferry rises to 41, divers halt search
The death toll from the ferry that capsized in the central Philippines has risen to 41 after rescuers recovered three more bodies from the hull.
Twelve people are still missing, but bad weather has hampered the search, local officials say.
The motorised, wooden-hulled Kim Nirvana was carrying 187 passengers and crew when it rolled onto its side and turned over minutes after leaving Ormoc City on Thursday.
Rescue boats quickly went in and picked up dozens of survivors who clung to the overturned hull, but others remained trapped inside.
There are 134 survivors so far, officials say.
But high waves and strong currents on Friday have forced rescue teams to postpone search efforts from divers, leaving only rubber boats to scour the surface for survivors.
Witnesses said the ferry appeared to turn sharply to the right and was hit by a large wave before it capsized.
Coast guard spokesman Armand Balilo said panicked passengers crowded the right side of the ferry, causing it to tilt slowly before capsizing.
"Some clung on to the hull of the overturned vessel, while some were rescued while swimming toward the shore," according to Ciriaco Tolibao, an official from the country's disaster management office.
Survivor Rhe-An Garciano added that "we were given life vests but we were not able to wear them before the ferry sank".
"The ferry was carrying cement and rice but it didn't appear to be overloaded," Mr Balilo added
Tens to hundreds of people die each year from ferry accidents in the Philippines, an archipelago of 7,100 islands with a notoriously poor record for maritime safety.
Overcrowding is common and many of the country's vessels are in bad condition.
