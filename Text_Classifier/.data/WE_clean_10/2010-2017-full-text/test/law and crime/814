Sen. Manchin Says Eric Holder Should Consider Resigning – Talking Points Memo
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said Friday that Attorney General Eric Holder should consider resigning over the Department of Justice’s seizure of journalist phone records as part of investigations into leaks of classified information.
“Whenever you feel that you have lost your effectiveness or may be losing your effectiveness to the detriment of the job that you do, you have to evaluate that and make a decision,” Manchin said, referencing the attorney general in an interview with Bloomberg Television set to air this weekend. “And I think we’re at the time now where decisions have to be made.”
Manchin’s comment about Holder comes in the wake of revelations that the National Security Agency had been collecting phone call and Internet data records, which the senator said “bothers” him.
“I’m wanting to do everything I can to fight the war on terror,” Manchin told Bloomberg. “There will not be another day in my life, my children or grandchildren’s life they won’t have to be vigilant against terrorists wanting to do us harm. But do you give up everything as an American?”
