UPDATE 1-Irish PM to address media at 1400 GMT Saturday
DUBLIN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen will address the media at 1400 GMT on Saturday, his Fianna Fail party said in a statement, following growing speculation about his future as leader of the ruling party.
The statement did not say what the briefing would be about. However, a botched attempt by Cowen to reshuffle the cabinet has prompted colleagues to plot afresh his removal.[ID:nLDE70K1G5]
Cowen won a secret ballot on his leadership on Tuesday, seemingly securing his position until a parliamentary election on March 11. But his challenger, former foreign minister Micheal Martin, said on Friday that the party should think again this weekend.
Cowenâ€™s thwarted reshuffle nearly brought down the coalition government on Thursday and forced him to call the early election.
Cowen was already the most unpopular premier in recent Irish history due to his handling of the economic crisis which forced Dublin to seek an EU/IMF bailout last year. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; editing by David Stamp)
