Ukraine Are The Women's World Team Champions!
The Ukrainian team of Anna Ushenina, Kateryna Lagno, Mariya Muzychuk, Inna Gaponenko and Natalia Zhukova won gold at the 2013 Women's World Team Championships in Kazakhstan after drawing their final match with Russia.
It was a fine victory for Ukraine who were undefeated in all their nine matches during the tournament, winning seven and drawing two. Their final round match with Russia was something of an anti-climax, with all games being fairly bloodless draws.
China narrowly defeated India 2½-1½ thanks to a win on top board by Ju Wenjun, and the Chinese team finished in silver medal position. Russia took the bronze.
The time control was 40 moves in 90 minutes, then 30 minutes to finish with a 30 second increment from the start of the game.
