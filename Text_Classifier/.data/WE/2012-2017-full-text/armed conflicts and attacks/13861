#NotAllMuslims Execute 19 Women For Refusing
As Iraq descends further and further into savagery, I think it’s safe to blame George W. Bush.
If this disturbs you, the Greatest President in the History of the United States would like you to get over it. Keep in mind what Obama said about these guys: “If a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.” See? They’re amateurs. They’re nothing. End of story.
If you make a big deal out of this, that means you hate Muslims. You are an Islamophobe. Don’t pretend you actually care about what happens to these women. How can you care about women if you hate Muslims? Plus, women get raped in the U.S. all the time.
Now, please excuse this wonderful man while he gets back to the important stuff:
The oceans aren’t going to recede on their own, teabaggers.
P.S. Oh, and shut up about Iran already. What do you think they’re going to do, nuke Israel? Yeah, right.
