A few minutes after the quake stopped, we went back inside the house,� he added.The spokesman for Afghanistan�s disaster management ministry, Omar Mohammadi, said two people in Nangarhar sustained serious injuries.He added that 74 houses were destroyed in that province and five others in northeastern Afghanistan � Badakhshan, Takhar, Baghlan, Kunar and Parwan.On Oct. 26, a magnitude-7.5 earthquake centered around 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Fayzabad, Badakhshan�s capital, left nearly 400 dead � including almost 300 in Pakistan � and more than 2,400 injured.
