Dynamite causes Morales to cancel speech
ORURO, Bolivia, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales abandoned plans to talk at an event in the mining city of Oruro after angry miners started tossing dynamite, officials said.
The president was supposed to speak during a parade commemorating a colonial-era uprising in Oruro, but he and his supporters left following explosions in the area, the BBC reported Friday.
Protesters were angry about increases in the cost of food, fuel and other commodities, the report said.
"The government took the decision not to respond to shameful provocations of this kind," said Ivan Canelas, the president's spokesman.
Angry protesters in Santa Cruz, which is an opposition stronghold, blocked the road leading to the airport. They demanded that the government abolish an agency set up to promote food production. They said the agency discourages private business.
The report said Morales' popularity has dropped since the beginning of the year when he scrapped plans to eliminate fuel subsidies.
