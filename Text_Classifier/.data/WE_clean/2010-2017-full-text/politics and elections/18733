Presidential aide named Senegal's new PM
A close aide to Senegal's president, has been named the country's new prime minister, two days after the resignation of his predecessor Aminata Toure. Mohamed Dionne, 54, will be the third prime minister serving under President Macky Sall, after Toure and former banker Abdoul Mbaye.
His appointment was confirmed by a presidential decree read on state RTS radio and television on Sunday.
Dionne has worked for the UN Industrial Development Organisation, which is mandated to promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development in developing countries and economies in transition. Since March, he had served as adviser to the president with the rank of minister tasked with overseeing an economic and social development plan. He attended a conference in Paris in February where international lenders pledged $7.6bn in aid to help begin the plan. Toure was sacked on Friday, less than a week after her ruling party was beaten in local elections. Many members of the government who were running in the local polls were defeated in their strongholds - a blow for the Alliance for the Republic (APR) headed by 51-year-old Toure. The APR controlled only a few towns before the election and was hoping to reinforce its local support bases. Toure, who had previously served as a justice minister, was the second woman prime minister in Senegal after Madior Boye, who led the government between March 2001 and November 2002. In her government policy statement in October, Toure had promised to meet social demands and restart the country's economy.
