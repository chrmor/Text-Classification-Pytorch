Manny Pacquiao Apologizes for Calling Gays ‘Worse Than Animals’
Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino world champion boxer turned politician, apologized Tuesday after calling people in gay relationships “worse than animals” during an interview with a local broadcaster, setting off a torrent of criticism.
In a video that was shared widely online Monday, Pacquiao told the TV5 network: “It’s common sense. Do you see animals mating with the same sex? Animals are better because they can distinguish male from female. If men mate with men and women mate with women, they are worse than animals.”
Pacquiao, 37, a second-term congressman, has been campaigning for a Senate seat in elections scheduled for May. His political ascendance has been fueled in large part by his storybook rise from poverty to avatar of national pride for the Philippines.
But the video of his recent remarks threatened to tarnish that image as fellow politicians, national celebrities and gay rights groups took turns issuing condemnations.
