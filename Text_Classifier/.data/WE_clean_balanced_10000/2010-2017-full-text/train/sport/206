FIFA Picks 4 Cities for 2017 Confederations Cup
The 2017 Confederations Cup will take place in the Russian cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, FIFA said Friday.
MOSCOW, December 14 (R-Sport) - The 2017 Confederations Cup will take place in the Russian cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, FIFA said Friday.
The Confederations Cup is a tournament between continental champions used as a test event for World Cup host countries.
Moscow’s vast Luzhniki stadium was officially confirmed as the venue for the 2018 World Cup final. The decision was widely expected because Luzhniki is the only host stadium that meets the relevant FIFA regulations.
Luzhniki will not be used for the Confederations Cup, with the new Spartak stadium picked instead as Moscow's venue.
Moscow and St. Petersburg will host a World Cup semifinal each, FIFA also confirmed at a meeting of its executive committee in Tokyo.
FIFA also selected the Byrom accommodation agency to handle FIFA’s hotel operations for the tournament, a role the company has fulfilled at every World Cup since 1994.
Byrom beat 17 other companies in an open tender, FIFA said.
