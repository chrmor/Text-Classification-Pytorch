Atlanta - Atlanta police say passengers who were evacuated from a terminal at Atlanta's airport are now being allowed back in after a bomb squad investigated and cleared a suspicious package.
Atlanta police Officer DT Hannah says the package "has been cleared" and the areas are being reopened.
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest airport, with 101.5 million passengers in 2015.
Hannah says in an e-mail that the package was found in the South domestic terminal on Wednesday morning.
The airport says in a statement on Twitter that the evacuation was done "out of an abundance of caution".
The evacuation comes one day after attacks at an airport and subway system in Brussels, Belgium, killed at least 34 people, including three suicide bombers.
