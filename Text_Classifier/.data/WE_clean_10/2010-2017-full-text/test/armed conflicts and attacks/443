Protest outside Egyptian embassy in Yemen
(CNN) -- A group of protesters marched outside the Egyptian Embassy in Yemen on Saturday.
Hakim Almasmari, editor in chief of the Yemen Post, said about 100 people took part in the demonstration in Sana'a.
Demonstrators expressed support for the Egyptian people and called on their own president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to leave office.
Almasmari said his reporters saw security forces apparently attacking some protesters, and one activist was detained.
A witness said said a number of people shouted against the protesters, saying, "We will sacrifice with our souls and blood for you Ali."
In recent days, much larger protests took place in Yemen, with thousands of people demanding the kind of change that forced Tunisia's president from office this month.
