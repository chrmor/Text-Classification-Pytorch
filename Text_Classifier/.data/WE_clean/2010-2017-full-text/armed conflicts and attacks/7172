Russia pulling diplomats out of Yemen
MOSCOW, June 4 (UPI) -- Russia is immediately evacuating 14 diplomats from the chaotic capital of Yemen, a diplomat said Saturday.
Amid escalating bloodshed in Sanaa, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was wounded in an attack on a mosque near the presidential palace Friday.
"Considering the complex situation in the Republic of Yemen ... we will send 14 diplomats by the next plane to Moscow," a diplomatic source told RIA Novosti.
The official said no Russians have yet been wounded in the conflict, but an evacuation of all nationals is being considered.
About 1,000 people from the former Soviet Union are believed to be in the Arabian country.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov condemned the violence in Yemen Saturday and urged a cease-fire.
