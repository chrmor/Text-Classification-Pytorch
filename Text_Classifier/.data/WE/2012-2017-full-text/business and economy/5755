Disney ends LucasArts' game development
Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday it will end video game development at Lucasfilm, a company it bought last year for about $4 billion, in an effort to cut costs.
"After evaluating our position in the games market, we've decided to shift (videogame division) LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model, minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games," read a statement from Lucasfilm.
As a result of the change, Disney said, there would be an unspecified number of layoffs. Some reports put the number of jobs at about 150.
Established in 1982, LucasArts has made numerous computer and video games based on the hit "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series of movies. It already had licensing agreements with popular brands like the game "Angry Birds" and Lego play-toy building blocks.
But the company, located in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio, has seen a lot of executive turnover in the past few years, and the new layoffs don't necessarily come as a surprise.
When Disney bought Lucasfilm in November, it said it planned to focus more on social and mobile games, rather than those built for consoles like X-box or Playstation3. Additionally, Disney has its own games division.
Chris Kohler of tech news site Wired points out that LucasArts has been struggling for a long time, and for Disney, it was not a priority to solve those problems. For video game lovers, meanwhile, Kohler said that the old days of creativity at LucasArts were long gone.
"The LucasArts that died today is not the one you loved, and it was never going to be again," he said.
The Lucasfilm company employs more than 1,800 people in San Francisco and other locations. It is looking for external partners to complete some games currently in development, such as "Star Wars 1313," a company representative told Bloomberg.
