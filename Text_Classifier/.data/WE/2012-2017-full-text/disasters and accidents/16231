Magnitude 7.1 earthquake jolts Alaska; 4 homes lost in explosions or fire
"When I bought my house in Anchorage, I had a geological map that shows what are the sturdiest parts of town and there were a few where I said, 'If there's an earthquake, that house is toast,'" Conter said. "That's how I chose my house. Literally. Drove my real estate agent nuts. But I didn't have one thing fall in my house. It was kind of clutch."
