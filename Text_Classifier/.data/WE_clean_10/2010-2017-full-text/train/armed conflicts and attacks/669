Police: Kenyan officer kills 10 in shooting rampage
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A Kenyan police officer killed 10 people during a shooting rampage in a small town northeast of the capital, local authorities said Sunday.
The officer assigned to guarding the district commissioner left his post at 3 a.m. to look for his girlfriend, according to a local journalist at the scene.
The officer, Peter Karanja, walked into several bars and allegedly shot customers and employees, including two off-duty officers.
Witnesses said after his rifle ran out of bullets, he walked to the nearest police station and turned himself in.
Several hundred people gathered outside the police station where Karanja was held and threatened to burn it down.
The shooting occurred in Siakago, about 90 miles northeast of Nairobi.
The suspect has been transferred to the provincial police headquarters for his safety.
