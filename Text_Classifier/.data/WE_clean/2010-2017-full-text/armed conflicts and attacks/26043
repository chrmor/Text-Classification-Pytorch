Pakistani Taliban kill seven police officers guarding polio workers
Group claims its gunmen carried out the two separate attacks in Karachi but officials say medical teams were not targeted
Taliban gunmen have killed seven police officers guarding medical workers administering polio vaccinations in the Pakistani city of Karachi.
The officers were killed in two attacks on Wednesday within 600 metres of each other near a market in the sprawling port metropolis, a senior police official said.
“One took place at the three policemen who were escorting a polio team, the policemen were on foot when they were attacked,” said the official, Ali Asif. “In the second incident, four policemen in a police van were targeted.”
While militants in Pakistan have on numerous occasions attacked teams trying to eradicate the crippling childhood disease, a police chief said his men were the target this time, not the health workers.
“The target was purely the police,” said the provincial police chief, Allah Dino Khawaja.
A spokesman for the group, Qari Saifullah Saif, said eight members carried out the attacks in revenge for the alleged killing of their colleagues by police in Karachi.
Teams in Pakistan working to immunise children against polio are often targeted by Taliban and other militant groups, who say the campaign is a cover for western spies, or accuse workers of distributing drugs designed to sterilise children.
At least 89 people – including vaccination workers and police officers – have been killed in such attacks since July 2012, according to a Reuters tally based on United Nations figures and media reports.
Last year, Pakistan reported 54 of 74 worldwide cases of polio, down drastically from the 306 cases reported in the country the year before, mainly due to expanded immunisation efforts.
Government officials in Karachi said the immunisation drive would be suspended while the violence was investigated.
