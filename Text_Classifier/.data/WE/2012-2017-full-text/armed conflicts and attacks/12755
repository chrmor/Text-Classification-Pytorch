Niger losses in Boko Haram weekend battle top 74-govt
NIAMEY, April 28 (Reuters) - Niger lost at least 46 soldiers and 28 civilians at the weekend in its bloodiest battle yet with Nigeria's Boko Haram militants, an initial defence ministry report showed on Tuesday.
The report said that 156 Boko Haram militants were also killed in the battle for control of the Karamga island on Lake Chad. The Niger army says it has since wrested back control of the island. (Reporting by Abdoulaye Massalaki; Writing by Emma Farge; Editing by Bate Felix)
