Iraqis launch offensive to retake Ramadi from ISIS
The operation appears to have begun late Wednesday, with Iraqi troops — backed by American and coalition warplanes — first securing the Palestine Bridge, according to information released by the U.S.-led joint task force overseeing the war on ISIS, as the terror group is also known. Located northwest of the city, the bridge is an important supply line that crosses the Euphrates River.
