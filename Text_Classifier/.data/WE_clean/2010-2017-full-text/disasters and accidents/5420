Japan quake official death toll tops 2400
THE death toll from a killer earthquake and tsunami that flattened much of Japan's northeast coast topped 2400, police say.
The National Police Agency today said 2414 people are confirmed dead and 3118 missing, with 1885 injured in the disaster which struck on Friday afternoon.
The official toll yesterday stood at 1647.
On Sunday, the police chief of Miyagi, one of the hardest-hit prefectures, said the number of deaths was expected to exceed 10,000 in his region alone.
Amid a mass rescue effort there were grim updates indicating severe loss of life along the battered east coast of Honshu island, where the monster waves destroyed or damaged more than 55,380 homes and other buildings.
More than 3000 houses were flooded by the tsunami, while some 130 houses had been burned, police said, adding that there were 68 landslides.
