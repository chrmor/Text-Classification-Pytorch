UK tabloid 'hacked murdered teen's phone'
British News of the World newspaper has been making the wrong kind of headlines after apparently hacking the phones of celebrities and politicians.
But the weekly tabloid has now been accused of hacking into the voicemail messages of a murdered British schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, shortly after she went missing in 2002.
David Cameron, the British prime minister, has urged police to "investigate vigorously" the new allegations.
Now, the teenager's family has joined the long queue of public figures seeking justice from News International, which owns the newspaper.
