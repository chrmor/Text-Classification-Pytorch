Israel plans more strikes in Gaza Strip
Israel will carry out further retaliatory air strikes on targets in the besieged Gaza Strip this weekend after Palestinian militants fired 45 rockets into Israel on Thursday, one targeting a school bus and critically injuring a 16-year-old boy.
The military wing of Hamas took responsibility for the bus attack ''as a first response to the crimes of the occupation and the assassination of three senior members of the organisation in [Gaza] on April 2''.
In response, the Israeli air force conducted 10 air raids on Gaza on Thursday, killing five Palestinians and injuring 40.
Authorities have shut down schools in southern Israel and will not reopen them until after the weekend, when the Defence Ministry can provide students with fortified buses.
In the past month, Israeli armed forces have launched repeated air strikes and ground attacks on targets inside the Gaza Strip, killing at least 20 people.
