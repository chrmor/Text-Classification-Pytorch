DPJ Candidates Kick Off Leadership Election
Former foreign minister Seiji Maehara kicked off the ruling Democratic Party of Japan’s presidential election Monday morning. The young lawmaker was the first of five aspiring prime ministers to make his final pitch to party voters, with the winner to succeed Naoto Kan as the country’s next prime minister.
The candidates are each making 15-minute remarks before voting is expected to begin at noon. The pitches are being broadcast live on at least three Japanese TV stations and streamed live on the Internet.
