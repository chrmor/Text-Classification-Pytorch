Ferguson: Van Persie 'could have been killed'
Ferguson, whose side moved four points clear at the top of the English Premier League table following Sunday's 1-1 draw, accused Williams of deliberately kicking the ball at the striker's head while he lay on the ground.
Van Persie and Williams squared up to each other following the incident as both sets of players tried to break up the confrontation.
"It was absolutely deliberate. The whistle has gone, the game has stopped and he has done that right in front of the referee -- he could have killed the lad.
Patrice Evra's 16th-minute header from a Van Persie corner had given United the lead before Michu equalized with his 13th Premier League goal of the season -- which put the Spaniard one clear of Van Persie as the leading scorer.
"We have been talking before about the mentality of the team; attacking, creating chances we had good movement, we were good in defense. As a team we had the balance we are looking for."
The defeat was Villa's worst in the top flight in its entire history and left manager Paul Lambert's team three points off the relegation zone.
"We were second best. We have to hold our hands hold our hand up, we never turned up at this level we can't play like that," Lambert said.
"We always learn, it will certainly be a wake-up call. It's been going fine for us and it is only Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs that have turned us over. We will bounce back."
The 29-year-old, whose contract was set to expire at the end of the season, will now remain in Germany until 2015.
"I have thought long and hard over this decision and I am very grateful that the bosses at Schalke gave me this time," he said on the club's official website.
Andre Ayew scored the only goal of the game to put Marseille third in the table on 38 points but with an inferior goal difference at the halfway stage going into the winter break.
