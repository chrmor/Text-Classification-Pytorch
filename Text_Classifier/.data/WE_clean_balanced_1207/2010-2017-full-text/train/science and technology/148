Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA
N.G. and E.B. conceived and planned the project and devised the information-encoding methods. P.B. advised on oligo design and Next-Generation Sequencing protocols, prepared the DNA library and managed the sequencing process. S.C. and E.M.L. provided custom oligonucleotides. N.G. wrote the software for encoding and decoding information into/from DNA and analysed the data. N.G., E.B., C.D. and B.S. modelled the scaling properties of DNA storage. N.G. wrote the paper with discussions and contributions from all other authors. N.G. and C.D. produced the figures.
S.C. and E.M.L. are employees of Agilent Technologies, a commercial provider of OLS pools. N.G. and E.B. are named inventors on a patent application on technologies described in this work.
