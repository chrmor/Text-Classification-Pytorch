India repatriates 39 Pak prisoners
ATTARI: As a goodwill gesture, ahead of Baisakhi, India on Monday repatriated 39 Pakistani prisoners including two females from Attari land border. The Pak prisoners returned home after spending sentences ranging from one and half year to eleven years on different charges. Strangely most of the Pak prisoners claims to have crossed the border by mistake while a few had entered India to carry out disruptive activities and others had jumped their visa's. A few Pak prisoners crossed the border singing songs of friendship while many were resentful of not recieivng their wages from the jail officials. The prisoners were brought here from jails of different places including Delhi, Janu, Amritsar, Sangrur etc informed naib tehsildar PPS Goraya who handed over the Pak prisoners to Pakistan Rangers. Resident of Karachi, Abdul Mazeed said that the bitterness among the hearts of both Indians and Pakistan's against each other had not been washed away but it had increased. "We being Pakistani's are discriminated in the jail, we are kept in high security areas whereas we had not committed any heinous crime " said he while talking to TOI. He said before being arrested he held Indians in high praise but in last eleven years he had realized that both Indians and Pakistani's hold animosity towards each other. He suggested that both countries should constitute a panel of lawyers to take up the cases of prisoners of both nations so no one had to spent a single day extra in jail. Mohammad Toquid of Faislabad alleged that many a times he was prevented from offering namaz in the jail. Besides, he said he was sentenced for five years whereas he was released after seven years. Toquid claimed that he had mistakenly entered India. So was the case of Karachi resident Altaf ur Rehman who was sentenced for five years but was allowed to go back to his country after nine years. He claimed that he had earned more than Rs 3 lakh wages in the jail but he was given only Rs 1.25 lakh. Dismal over the bureaucratic hiccups in both countries he said "dono chanae ki eik hi daal hai". Mother of two Razia from Lahore candidly admitted that she had arrived India to meet her mother and jumped visa but when she tried to go back to his country she was held at Attari and was sentenced to sixteen months. It was a celebration time for Mohommod Yaseen of Faislabad who chose to sing songs of friendship while crossing over to his country . "Past is past now I am being sent home so I should celebrate the moment‚Äù said he.
