At least 18 people have been killed in Guatemala, including a dozen on a bus that was buried in a landslide, as heavy rains lashed the Central American nation and southern Mexico.
Guatemalan president Alvaro Colom has declared a national emergency after weeks of driving rains triggered the landslides.
"Top priority at present is dealing with this emergency," he said.
"There are no funds left to deal with earlier disasters like the one caused by (tropical storm) Agatha."
He said damage estimates across Guatemala after weeks of rain stood at $US350-500 million, or 40 per cent of the damage wrought by Agatha, which killed 183 people in Central America, including 165 in Guatemala, and left thousands homeless in June.
The latest rains triggered two landslides on Saturday.
One swept away a bus on a road near central Chimaltenango city killing at least 10 people and injuring 20; the other killed four people inside a house in western Quetzaltenango.
Guatemala's meteorologists have forecast another 24 to 36 hours of heavy rain throughout most of the country.
