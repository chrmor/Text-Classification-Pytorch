Mass grave uncovered in Israel's Jaffa
The remains of around 200 bodies have been found in an unmarked mass grave in the coastal Israeli town of Jaffa.
Forensic experts have taken some of the remains for examination.
But Palestinians who were alive during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war say they saw what happened in the town.
