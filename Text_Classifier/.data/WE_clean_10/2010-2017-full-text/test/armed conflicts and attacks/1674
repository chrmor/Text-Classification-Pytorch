Suicide car bomb kills 23 in Baghdad
A suicide bomber has detonated an explosive-rigged car outside Iraq's main religious affairs office for Shi'ite Muslims, shearing off the facade of the three-storey building and killing at least 23 people.
More than 70 people were wounded in Monday's explosion that shattered nearby windows and damaged cars in Baghdad's central Bab al-Muadham area, two police officials said. Firefighters searched the debris for survivors.
In apparent retaliation, a mortar shell hit close to Iraq's main office for Sunni Muslim religious affairs in northeastern Baghdad later on Monday but caused no damage or injuries.
Violence has dropped sharply in Iraq in recent years but attacks on government offices and members of the security forces, aimed at undermining the Shi'ite-led ruling coalition, are still common. Monday's explosion came at a time of a prolonged political paralysis caused by sectarian tensions.
Adel Ahmed, an employee in the Baghdad Health Department, said he was reading a newspaper in his office near the religious affairs building when the blast went off around 1700 AEDT.
"The ceiling fell on my head and I was slightly wounded in the head and fell down," Ahmed told The Associated Press.
