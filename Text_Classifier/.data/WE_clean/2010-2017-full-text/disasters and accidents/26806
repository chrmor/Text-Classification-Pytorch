Belgium passenger train crashes into rear of freight train, killing three, mayor says
A passenger train has crashed into the back of a freight train in the eastern Belgian municipality of Saint-Georges-Sur-Meuse, killing three people and injuring 40, Belgian officials said.
The accident occurred on the line linking Namur and the city of Liege in the east of the country, with local emergency services and reinforcements from Liege at the site of the crash.
"A train â€¦ carrying around 40 passengers crashed into the back of a freight train on the same track," Belgian railways SNCB said in a joint statement with railway infrastructure firm Infrabel.
"Two of the six carriages derailed and are lying on the tracks."
The crash took place about 11:00pm on Sunday, local time, the statement said.
The Mayor of the Saint-Georges-Sur-Meuse district, Francis Dejon, told Belga news agency that three people were dead and 40 injured in the crash, according to a preliminary estimate.
The passenger train slammed into the back of the goods train on the same track at high speed, said Frederic Sacre, a spokesman for Infrabel.
The front carriage was completely turned on its side, an AFP photographer at the scene said.
Belga reported that the collision had been "very violent" and several passengers had to be extracted from the wreckage.
The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, with questions remaining over whether the passenger train was able to brake before the crash.
"The priority is to care for the victims," Infrabel and SNCB said, but added that information was already being analysed to determine how the crash took place.
