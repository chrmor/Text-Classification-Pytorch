Mubarak unleashes chaos
Just hours after promising that he would give up power seven months from now, Hosni Mubarak unleashed the "chaos" he had warned Egyptians was the only alternative to his autocratic regime. The regime's thugs ran riot in the center of Cairo, Alexandria and other cities Wednesday, attacking what had been peaceful anti-government encampments with stones, knives and Molotov cocktails.
Bahey El Din Hassan, who is one of Egypt's leading human rights activists, is not surprised. Hassan, who for the last quarter century has been one of the relatively small contingent of activists fighting against the abuses of the Mubarak regime, recognized tactics he has been documenting for years -- the use of plainclothes intelligence and security operatives; violence directed against peaceful protesters and journalists; and, most of all, the attempt to create a pretext for a still bloodier intervention.
"I was expecting that something like this would happen today," Hassan told me in an interview in Washington. "Because even though he offered the country a deal last night, Mubarak's statement was not reconciliatory. His speech was full of threats and negative interpretations of the demonstrations. And immediately after it ended state television began calling for 'supporters of stability' to show their strength."
Hassan's cellphone was chiming incessantly during our conversation with calls from his colleagues in Cairo's Tahrir square. "They are afraid there is a plan to clear the square tonight by any means," he said. In other words, rather than beginning the "orderly transition" to democracy President Obama said should begin "now" in Cairo, Mubarak may be trying to create the conditions for a massacre -- an Arab Tiananmen Square.
Hassan, who currently is director of a regional human rights group called the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, left Egypt on Jan. 25, the day opposition organizers had planned a "day of rage" against the Egyptian government. In contrast to Tunisia's spontaneous uprising, Egypt's was planned. But Hassan said neither he nor the young leaders of the April 6 movementwho organized that first protest expected such a huge turnout. Nor did they plan for the demonstrations to continue beyond Jan. 25.
"At first they weren't even sure they could continue until Friday," Jan. 28 -- the day that hundreds of thousands first took to the streets, Hassan said. The massive response, he said, "is very good news. But we don't yet have a real breakthrough.There is a lot of maneuvering and manipulation by the regime." Mubarak, he added, may still have the capacity to restore order by force.
Hassan watched President Obama's statement Tuesday night, and saw it as a good example of what U.S. policy has been the last two years: "fine words, but no action." "I think that this administration in practice has supported not only the Mubarak regime but all the authoritarian regimes in the Arab region," he said.
"The Cairo speech president Obama made two years ago sent a very good message to the Arab people. But in reality the administration engaged with the regimes at the expense of the people. It didn't help the people of the region and it didn't help U.S. long-term interests -- and this is what we now see in the streets of Cairo."
Some in Washington argue that the United States has little ability to affect the outcome of Egypt's crisis. But Hassan warned that if Mubarak represses the pro-democracy movement or fails to carry out a democratic transition, both Egyptians and Arabs around the region will blame the Obama administration.
"Rightly of wrongly, the Egyptian people think the United States is still supporting Mubarak," he said. "Rightly or wrongly, they think the United States has unlimited power to push Mubarak to respond positively. If he doesn't respond that way, that means the United States didn't push or agrees with how he handles the situation."
In other words, if Obama does not want to be known as the American president who facilitated the ugly violence Mubarak has unleashed in Cairo, he will have to act forcefully, publicly -- and quickly.
