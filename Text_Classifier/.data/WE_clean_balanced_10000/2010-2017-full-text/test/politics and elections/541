Recall Elections in Sharply Divided Wisconsin Are Ending on Frenetic Note
More surprising, though, is the level of interest beyond the state’s borders. These state legislative races (which might, in a normal year, go mostly ignored outside the state capital) are being seen by some as an early measure of what is ahead for both political parties in 2012 and one gauge of public opinion of the set of states, including this one, where Republicans scored sweeping victories in statehouses in 2010.
Here, state officials and other experts are reluctant to make predictions about the recall outcomes given little history to use as a model, a peculiar array of variables and a confusing, staggered set of election dates that included primaries with Republican-leaning candidates who ran as Democrats as a strategy to help Republican incumbents.
Since the state began allowing recalls of state-level politicians in 1926, only four such elections — which allow a new challenger to oppose an incumbent before a term’s end — were held before this year, and only two of the incumbents were ultimately thrown out.
Still, leaders in both political parties are professing optimism. “Enthusiasm and momentum are on our side,” said Mark Miller, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate, who suggested that Democrats had the ability to capture all six of the Republican seats in question.
Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, said he had confidence that Republicans would maintain their majority in the chamber, which they now control 19 to 14. “No question about it,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.
In a way, the senators facing recall, after residents gathered thousands of signatures on petitions, were picked less for individual acts than for fitting one of two categories.
The six Republicans voted in favor of the cuts to collective bargaining rights earlier this year, have served in office for at least a year (a technical requirement of the state’s recall provision) and were, in some cases, viewed as coming from districts where Democratic voters had gained in numbers of late.
The two Democrats (a third Democrat already survived a recall effort last month) fled Wisconsin along with the rest of the Senate’s Democrats in a maneuver to try to block a vote on the collective bargaining measure, served for at least a year and were, in some cases, viewed as coming from districts where Republicans had gained in numbers.
Senator Dan Kapanke, from a district in the La Crosse area that President Obama won in 2008, is viewed as one of the most vulnerable of the Republicans, in part because his district includes lots of public workers who would presumably be most affected by Republicans’ cuts to benefits and collective bargaining rights. Mr. Kapanke seemed not to help himself when he told a Republican group this spring (in an address that was secretly recorded and described in local newspaper accounts) that Republicans had to hope government workers “kind of are sleeping” on Election Day.
“We’re competing against every left-wing group you’ve heard of — and everyone you haven’t,” Mr. Kapanke’s campaign manager, Jennifer Harrington, said the other day.
Even once Tuesday’s votes are counted, however, control of the Senate might not be known. Unless one party or the other wins most of the races, all eyes will turn to the recall elections of Senate Democrats next week. Senator Jim Holperin, a Democrat who represents towns like this one, Sayner, in the state’s far Northwoods, is seen as the most vulnerable Democrat.
The outcomes of the recall elections seem likely to help decide the future of another, larger recall effort. Democrats have pledged to remove Mr. Walker, but signatures cannot be gathered for such an effort until at least next January, when he will have served a year in office. A victory by Republicans in the Senate would most likely temper such talk, while victories for the Democrats would encourage more of it.
Even beyond the elections, this state’s partisan gulf seems to have seeped into nearly every layer of government. Law enforcement authorities have investigated reports that a dispute between justices on the State Supreme Court turned physical during discussions over the state’s cuts to collective bargaining, and a lawsuit has been filed to stop those cuts from taking effect. And last week, a state facilities worker was charged with a misdemeanor after being accused of popping a protester’s balloon with a knife at the State Capitol, a place that has seen regular, continuing protests since the collective bargaining cuts were first announced.
