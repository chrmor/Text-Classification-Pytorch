'Grave reservations' on Burma poll
Australia has expressed "grave reservations" about Burma's plan to hold its first election in 20 years on November 7.
The country's ruling military junta named the date on Friday.
But concerns have been raised that the poll will be neither free nor fair.
Amnesty International says the regime has prevented more than 2000 political prisoners - including high-profile activist Aung San Suu Kyi - from contesting the election.
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith was also concerned about the election's legitimacy.
"We have grave reservations about the election process and the country's highly restrictive political environment," he said in a statement.
