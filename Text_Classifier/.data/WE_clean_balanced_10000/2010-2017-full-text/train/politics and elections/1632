With Deadline Looming, Government Funding Bill Passes House
House Democrats huddled Thursday night to discuss a way forward after the spending measure had prompted a public rift between the White House and progressive Democrats, who primarily objected to the bill's inclusion of a rollback of financial reforms. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, famed as a thorn in Wall Street's side, branded those changes a "bailout" for big banks at taxpayers' expense.
But some key Democrats emerged from the meeting acknowledging it was better to pass the bill then risk another shutdown. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said on the House floor it was "better to pass it than to defeat it.‚Äù
The White House said Thursday that, while the administration "objects to the inclusion of ideological and special interest riders" in the bill, the president supports the overall legislation and will not veto it.
But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - who also opposed the inclusion of the banking changes - publicly slammed the bill, calling its loosening of financial regulations "a ransom and a blackmail" and saying that she's "enormously disappointed" that the White House is accepting its inclusion in the spending measure.
After GOP leaders postponed a scheduled 2pm ET vote, Pelosi told fellow Democrats they had increased their "leverage" to amend the legislation and strip out portions they dislike, including an addition that raises donation limits to party committees.
