Dow tops 14,000
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 149 points, or 1.1%, to hit 14,009.8, its highest closing level since Oct. 12, 2007. The Dow is now less than 200 points from its all-time high of 14,198.10.
The S&P 500 rose 1% and is also at its highest level since 2007 -- about 4% away from its record high. The Nasdaq gained 1.2%.
Despite the day's big gains, stocks ended modestly higher for the week. The Dow gained 0.8%, the S&P 500 increased 0.6% and the Nasdaq climbed 0.9%.
Friday's strong advance followed reports on the job market, the manufacturing sector, construction spending and consumer sentiment, which all pointed to a healthy economic recovery.
The U.S. economy added 157,000 jobs last month, fewer than the 180,000 economists were expecting, but investors were encouraged by the government's revisions to its 2012 data. The revisions showed that the economy added 335,000 more jobs in 2012 than originally reported.
"The revisions point to a fairly healthy 181,000 per month trend in 2012, which is more than strong enough over time to bring down the unemployment rate," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.
In January, however, the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 7.9% from 7.8% in December. Economists were expecting it to edge lower.
The stalled unemployment rate is "giving strength to the argument that the Fed will continue its bond buying program and keep rates low, which is also a positive for the stock market," said Tom Schrader, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus.
The Fed's commitment to low rates is also boosting the bond market, added Schrader. The price of the 10-year Treasury rose, pushing the yield to 1.96%, down from 1.98% late Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Census Bureau said that construction spending rose 0.9% in December, which was well above expectations.
The Institute for Supply Management's monthly manufacturing index rose to 53.1 in January, a sign that manufacturing sector is continuing to expand. Economists were expecting a reading of 50.5.
The University of Michigan's sentiment index rose to 73.8 in January. Economists were expecting a reading of 71.4.
