Kashmir: Four shot dead in latest protests
Four people have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir, as the worst anti-government violence to hit the disputed region in two years continues.
Demonstrators have been pouring on to the streets and attacking police stations, defying attempts by the authorities to enforce a curfew.
More than 30 people have been killed in the violence since early June.
Indian-administered Kashmir's Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah, appealed to the population not to use violence.
He was speaking on Monday after emergency talks with the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the capital, Delhi.
"Tragically, we have locked ourselves into a cycle of violence where protests lead to death leading to further protests, leading to further casualties," he told a news conference.
The four men killed on Monday were shot by Indian police and paramilitary forces in separate incidents across Muslim-majority Kashmir.
Normal life has been severely disrupted for more than seven weeks by a series of curfews, protests and strikes.
Protests against Indian rule erupted after a 17-year-old student was killed by a police tear gas shell in early June.
The BBC's Chris Morris in Delhi says the political stalemate in the Himalayan valley has been a running sore of Indian governments for decades.
