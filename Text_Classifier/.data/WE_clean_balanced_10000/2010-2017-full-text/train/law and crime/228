Tajikistan frees jailed BBC reporter
Urunboy Usmonov, 59, was freed on bail on Thursday evening after signing a written pledge to remain in Tajikistan to face criminal charges.
The release follows a month of mounting pressure on the Tajik authorities from the BBC, the European Union, the OSCE, and human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, and Reporters without Borders.
Mr Usmonov was arrested at the start of June charged with belonging to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an Islamic group which is illegal in Tajikistan, although permitted in the UK and the US.
Peter Horrocks, the BBC's Global News director, said the BBC was "encouraged that Tajik authorities have considered our appeals".
"As we have said all along, we believe Urunboy is innocent and all he was doing was his journalistic work for the BBC. We know that his family and friends are delighted to have Urunboy back and are appreciative of the support from colleagues at the BBC and around the world," he added.
Tajik Prosecutor General Sherkhon Salimzoda said today that prosecutor's "have studied a criminal case against Usmonov and come to conclusion that they can continue conducting the case without keeping the accused in custody".
Earlier this month, the authorities said they were no longer prosecuting Mr Usmonov for membership and the banned group, and were instead charging him for failing to inform the authorities of people he knew to be members.
Amnesty International accused the Tajik authorities of persecuting Mr Usmonov for critical reports.
"Amnesty International considers that the charges against Urunboy Usmonov have been fabricated purely as punishment for his journalistic work, said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia said.
