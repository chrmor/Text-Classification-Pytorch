Sudan military plane crashes, killing 15
A Sudanese military plane crashed southwest of Khartoum on Sunday, killing 15 people, state media said.
The plane, which had 22 people onboard, was headed to El Fasher town, according to a military spokesman.
Before the plane split in half and erupted in flames, the captain called in a technical emergency, said spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khalid.
In August, a government plane crash in Sudan killed 32 people, including four Cabinet ministers and other top government officials.
Another military plane on a reconnaissance mission crashed in December, leaving six people dead.
