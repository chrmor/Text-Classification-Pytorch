Guatemala election: Comedian Jimmy Morales elected president in landslide victory
Former TV comedian Jimmy Morales, who has no experience in government, has won Guatemala's presidential election in a landslide after a corruption scandal toppled the last president and stoked outrage with the political establishment.
The headquarters of Morales' National Convergence Front (FCN) party erupted in celebration with live music and dozens of revellers.
A political outsider promising clean government, Mr Morales had 72.4 per cent of the vote with returns in from 70 per cent of polling stations, well ahead of former first lady Sandra Torres, who had around 27.6 percent.
Well before the full tally was announced, Mr Morales claimed victory and Ms Torres conceded defeat.
"As president I received a mandate, and the mandate of the people of Guatemala is to fight against the corruption that is consuming us. God bless and thank you," he said as results showed him on course for a massive victory.
With tales of his humble origins and jokes from a 14-year stint on a sketch comedy show, the 46-year-old Mr Morales connected with voters fed up with corruption that sparked nationwide protests and finally toppled Otto Perez from the presidency last month.
Mr Morales has faced criticism over fanciful policy ideas, like promising to hand out smartphones to kids or tagging teachers with GPS devices to make sure they show up for class.
His manifesto runs to just six pages, giving few clues as to how he might govern, and his FCN party will have just 11 out of 158 seats in the next Congress.
