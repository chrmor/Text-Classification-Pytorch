The engine explosion on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. "The unsafe condition," the FAA said in the order, "is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design." That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said.
