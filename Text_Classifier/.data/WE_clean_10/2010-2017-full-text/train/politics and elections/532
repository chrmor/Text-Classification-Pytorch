Poll shows support for Treaty referendum
Almost three quarters of voters want to see any new European Treaty put to a referendum, according to a new opinion poll.
The Red C poll for tomorrow's Sunday Business Post shows opinion evenly divided on the treaty, with a slight majority in favour of accepting it.
The Government has said it will not decide whether a referendum is required on the new EU treaty until the final text is agreed at a summit on Monday.
According to the poll 72% of voters say they want a referendum, while 21% do not and just 7% do not know.
When it comes to the treaty itself, 40% say they will support it, with 36% against, and 24% undecided.
Since the last Red C poll for Paddy Power a fortnight ago, support for Fine Gael has dropped three points to 30% and Labour is down two to 14%.
Fianna Fáil gains one to 18%, Sinn Féin is up three to 17%, and Independents and Others are up one to 21%.
