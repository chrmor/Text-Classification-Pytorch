Qantas engineers  to strike this week
Qantas passengers face probable disruptions to flights after the airline's 1600 licensed aircraft engineers announced today that they would begin strike action this week.
A one-hour strike is planned between 8am and 9am on Friday.
"We will wind it up slowly," said Steve Purvinas, national secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association.
Last-ditch talks this morning between Qantas management and the union representing the aircraft engineers before a Fair Work Australia judge failed to resolve the differences.
Mr Purvinas said in a statement today that negotiations had "hit a brick wall" and its members intended to begin protected industrial action later this week.
Last month the engineers voted in favour of industrial action if pay talks stalled. However, they need to give three days' notice before they can take legally protected action.
