MH370: Raw satellite data released - Nation
KUALA LUMPUR: The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has released the raw data obtained from British satellite firm Inmarsat which was used to determine the path of missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370.
“Inmarsat and the DCA have been working for the release of the data communication logs and the technical description of the analysis,” read a press statement released by the department on Tuesday.
It said that 47 pages of data containing the communication logs as well as relevant explanations and tables was being released in accordance with Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein’s instructions.
The department added that those with additional information and queries could email the DCA at mh370@dca.gov.my.
The raw data is available to the public on the DCA website.
Flight MH370, with 239 people on board including 12 crew members, departed from the KL International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 and disappeared from radar screens about an hour later while over the South China Sea.
The Boeing 777-200ER aircraft was supposed to have landed in Beijing at 6.30am on the same day.
A multinational search was launched to trace the aircraft, initially in the South China Sea, and then in the southern Indian Ocean when it was determined to have deviated from its original path.
