Family of Whitney Houston attend private burial in New Jersey
Pop star Whitney Houston has been laid to rest at a cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey, a day after a star-studded funeral service.
The late singer was buried at Fairview Cemetery beside her father John Russell Houston, who died in 2003.
The 48-year-old was found dead at a Los Angeles hotel last week. She was discovered submerged in the bath, the cause of death as yet unknown.
Fans watched the hearse travel to the cemetery, but were not allowed in.
Her funeral service was attended by some of the biggest names in music on Saturday, including her cousin Dionne Warwick, her mentor and former label boss Clive Davis, and Stevie Wonder.
One of the biggest voices of the 80s, Houston sold millions of singles and albums worldwide.
Investigators are now awaiting the results of toxicology tests.
Fans of Whitney Houston gathered at the funeral parlour to watch the golden hearse bearing her coffin leaving for the cemetery.
Some ran alongside the hearse, shouting "We love you, Whitney." Others gathered along the route, some applauding respectfully as the convoy passed by.
During Saturday's three-and-a-half hour funeral service, Wonder, Alicia Keys, and R Kelly all performed in her memory. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred opposite Houston in the film The Bodyguard, paid tribute to what he called the "sweet miracle" of her life.
Houston's ex-husband, Bobby Brown, arrived at the service but left again shortly afterwards.
He later said in a statement released to US media that he and his children "were seated by security and then subsequently asked to move on three separate occasions".
