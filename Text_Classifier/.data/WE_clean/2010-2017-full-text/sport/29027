Penn State vs. Wisconsin 2016: final score: PSU comes back from 21 down to win Big Ten
No. 6 Wisconsin and No. 7 Penn State battled in Indianapolis for the Big Ten crown on Saturday, with Penn State overcoming a 28-7 deficit to win, 38-31. That makes this game a microcosm of this season for a team that started the year 2-2 and went on to win the Big Ten.
The conference entered with four teams in the second-to-last top seven, which made this the biggest game of conference championship weekend. Now we’ll wait about 13 hours to find out whether PSU did enough to make the Playoff. A Rose Bowl bid, at absolue worst.
Scores and stuff, with instant, play-by-play instant notes below this section
Penn State 38, Wisconsin 31 (1:01, 4Q). The Nittany Lions stuffed Corey Clement on fourth-and-1, giving themselves a chance to burn up two Wisconsin time outs and almost the rest of the clock. That’s that. Big Ten champs. A star’s born in Trace McSorley, who finished with 384 passing yards and four touchdowns.
Penn State 38, Wisconsin 31 (5:47, 4Q). A couple 15-yard flags kept a nine-play drive going. PSU has now outgained UW, 454 to 364, and if not for those two early turnovers, this game might already be done. Sure didn’t think we’d be saying that at this point about a Penn State lead. Trace McSorley is still averaging a silly 12.4 yards per pass.
Penn State 35, Wisconsin 31 (13:41, 4Q). PSU is on a 28-3 run after yet another big-play strike from Trace McSorley, this time to Saquon Barkley to end a drive that included two throws of 25-plus to DaeSean Hamilton.
McSorley’s broken former Michigan State QB Connor Cook’s Big Ten Championship record for passing yards in a game, with 362 so far, plus four TDs. And this happened earlier:
Wisconsin 31, Penn State 28 (:16, 4Q). The Badgers finally break the slump, but can’t convert a third-and-8 after a drive that included two 20-yard gains. PSU’s chance to take the lead for the first time all day.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 28 (4:22, 3Q). That’s 21 unanswered against one of the country’s best defenses. Saquon Barkley (he’s playing, btw) punched in the finisher after an eight-play drive with three different gains of more than 15 yards. Big-play offense.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 21 (10:58, 3Q). One play after a missed Wisconsin field goal, Penn State struck with its third long passing TD of the night, a 70-yarder to Saeed Blacknall. Whole new ball game, and so forth.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 14 (half). Other than Penn State’s two turnovers, this game has evened up. PSU’s offense is all about big plays, and it’s connected on enough to remain in this game. Wisconsin’s still averaging 6.6 yards per run, but PSU’s up to 8.6 per run.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 14 (:58, 2Q). Penn State’s two scores were both long passes, the latest a 40-yarder from Trace McSorley to a streaking Saeed Blacknall, completing a 90-yard drive. Two Wisconsin possessions coming up.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 7 (2:25, 2Q). No new scores to report. Just look at this by T.J. Watt and friends. PSU QB Trace McSorley was wobbly after this, and Wisconsin punted the ball back after killing a couple minutes.
Wisconsin 28, Penn State 7 (5:15, 2Q). PSU went for it on fourth-and-2, giving UW a short field for a five-play, 42-yard drive, with Dare Ogunbowale trotting in the score. Wisconsin’s averaging 6.8 yards per rush and now has full clearance to just start sitting on the clock. Only 35 minutes left. Very few teams are capable of putting 21 points on Wisconsin’s defense in that amount of time.
Wisconsin 21, Penn State 7 (9:42, 2Q). A snap flew over PSU QB Trace McSorley’s head, and the ensuing blooper ended with Wisconsin’s Ryan Connelly in the end zone with the ball.
Wisconsin 14, Penn State 7 (1:10, 1Q). Penn State has at least one play that works really well: throwing it high and far to Mike Gesicki. Listen to Gus Johnson holler:
QB Trace McSorley’s celebration was good, too. (Apparently he always does this.)
Wisconsin 14, Penn State 0 (3:06, 1Q). Corey Clement broke a 67-yard touchdown after another Penn State three-and-out, and PSU’s slim Playoff hopes are slimmer by the second.
Wisconsin 7, Penn State 0 (5:27, 1Q). A 14-play, 81-yard voyage of a drive, capped by a one-yard Austin Ramesh run and highlighted by a 24-yard Bart Houston throw up the seam to Jazz Peavy. PSU got nothing on its opening drive, so UW’s looking good on both sides.

Penn State’s season went from a James Franklin hot seat to a Big Ten East title, just like that:
On September 29 — barely two months ago — PSU’s AD was forced to address rumors of Franklin’s status. The Nittany Lions were 2-2 with losses to Pitt (by a little) and Michigan (by a lot), and with expectations being a confusing concept in Happy Valley, many assumed trouble. Franklin was 16-14 with the Nittany Lions. Since leaving Ann Arbor, he is 8-0. So what has actually improved? In short, the passing game. Penn State’s offense ranked 53rd in Rushing S&P+ in 2015 and ranks 73rd in 2016. The defense ranked 15th in Def. S&P+ and now ranks 11th. That doesn’t scream “Massive improvement!” However, the Nittany Lions have improved from 73rd to a staggering third in Passing S&P+. Funny how much of a difference that can make. You can make a case that the threat of speedy running back Saquon Barkley opens up opportunities in the passing game, but sophomore quarterback Trace McSorley has been one of 2016’s unsung heroes.
While Wisconsin has weathered injuries to present one of the country’s best and steadiest defenses:
