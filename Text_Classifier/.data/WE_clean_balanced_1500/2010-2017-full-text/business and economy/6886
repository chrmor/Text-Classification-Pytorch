FTSE 100 hits record high as pound weakens below $1.23
A further weakening of sterling helped push the FTSE 100 to a record high during trading on Tuesday.
The country's premier share index climbed above 7,123 points just after midday - beating its previous highest level recorded in April last year and going as high as 7,129 before slipping back.
It finished the day at 7,070, just shy of its highest recorded market close level of 7,103.
Shares in the firms that make up the index have soared this month in pound terms as the currency has sagged to fresh 31-year lows.
The FTSE 100 consists largely of export-dominated multi-nationals which make the bulk of their sales in dollars - making the stocks of such firms more attractive when those sales are converted back to pounds.
However, on dollar terms, the FTSE's market value remains well below its referendum result level - down more than 6%.
The new record for the FTSE was marked as sterling slid back below $1.23 - with more bloodshed for the currency seen likely in the wake of the so-called 'flash crash' last Friday amid a market frenzy over the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said: "The index jumped as the pound took another leg lower on mounting concerns about what a 'hard Brexit' will look like.
"Leaked Treasury documents argue that the cost Brexit could be £66bn per year, due to a slump in GDP of up to 9.5% compared with staying in the EU." 
The FTSE 250, which has benefited from evidence the UK will avoid recession more than currency weakness, is also hovering near record highs.
Analysts have said the collapse in sterling has made UK firms more attractive for potential overseas buyers.
