12 killed after Polish bus crashes in Germany
"The number killed is now 12, and the number of very seriously injured six," a police spokesman told AFP.
The spokesman said that the bus hit a bridge pillar after swerving to avoid a car joining the motorway, not far from Berlin's Schoenefeld airport.
The fire brigade had said earlier 22 people have grave or light injuries after the accident near the Schoenefelder Kreuz motorway junction.
Some 250 members of the emergency services were at the scene, supported by helicopters. The motorway was closed after the accident.
The nationalities of those killed or injured was not clear. Reports said that the coach had 46 people on board.
