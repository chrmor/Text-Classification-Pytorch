Pakistan bomb blast kills 'at least nine' in Peshawar
A bomb has exploded on a busy road in Pakistan's north-western city of Peshawar, killing at least nine people and wounding at least 20 others.
A coach and at least two other vehicles, including a van belonging to the Pakistan Air Force, were destroyed, police said.
Officials said the van was the target of the attack.
Peshawar is near Pakistan's tribal belt - a stronghold of Taliban and al-Qaeda militants.
Hundreds have died in attacks in and around the city in recent years.
Wednesday's bomb was planted in parked car, and contained 30-40kg (66-88lb) of explosives as well as ball bearings and artillery shells, an official told the AFP news agency.
Another official said that the bomb was detonated by remote control.
No group has so far said it carried out the attack.
Earlier this month a suicide bomber killed two people and injured 19 others when he drove his car into a vehicle from the US consulate in Peshawar.
