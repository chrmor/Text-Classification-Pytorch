New Karachi violence kills 33
KARACHI, Pakistan, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- At least 33 people have died and 50 injured in violence ahead of special parliamentary elections in Karachi, Pakistan, police said.
Shootings Sunday by gunmen on motorcycles, in cars and on foot occurred across the city in apparent targeted killings, Dawn News reported.
The victims included two whose two bodies were found trussed up and blind-folded with more than a dozen gunshot wounds each and a rickshaw driver fatally shot near the Azizabad police station, Dawn said.
Five vehicles were also set afire Saturday night in wake of ongoing ethnic, religious and political contention.
The killings coincided with elections to fill a position in the PS-94 constituency Orangi Town left vacant after the assassination of its representative Raza Haider.
