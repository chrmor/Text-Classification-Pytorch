Taking the oath, Battulga pledged to respect and protect the rights and freedom of Mongolian citizens, "observe and protect the Constitution of Mongolia, protect sovereignty and independence, security and integrity of the state, and truly serve the people."
Aiming at reducing poverty, Battulga said he will restore the economy, develop the industrial sphere and ensure ecological balance.
