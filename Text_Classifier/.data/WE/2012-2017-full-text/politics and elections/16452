Vanuatu's new Parliament elects Charlot Salwai nation's 11th prime minister
Charlot Salwai will be Vanuatu's 11th prime minister after receiving more than 40 votes from the 52 Members of Parliament.
Mr Salwai is from the Reunification of Movements for Change (RMC) party, part of what has become known as the Pele Group for their seclusion on Pele Island to build a coalition after last month's election.
The newly-elected Prime Minister thanked political leaders for their confidence and trust, saying it had been a privilege for him to work with former prime ministers before he himself became a Member of Parliament in 2002.
As an advisor before entering Parliament, Mr Salwai was the private secretary to former prime minister Carlot Korman.
He called on the unity of the nation to carry out development projects to help people on its many islands, saying that the results of snap elections had sent a clear message of change with the election of many new MPs.
Vanuatu's legislature was dismantled in late 2015 after 14 members were jailed for bribery.
A former accountant and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Salwai is the member for the island of Pentacost.
He has also served as a deputy opposition leader, an opposition whip, and as a minister in internal affairs, finance, education, lands and trades.
The speaker, Esmon Saimon, and deputy speakers have also been appointed, 20 days after the snap election was held.
