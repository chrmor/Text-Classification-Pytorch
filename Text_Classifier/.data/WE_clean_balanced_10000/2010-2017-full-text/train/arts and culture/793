Zsa Zsa Gabor asks for last rites
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, a fixture in Hollywood for six decades, asked that a priest read her the last rites on Sunday, following hospitalization two days earlier due to complications from hip surgery.
The 93-year-old Gabor, whose string of movies, television shows and wealthy husbands dates to the 1950s, was visited by a priest at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, her husband Frederick Prinz von Anhalt, told Reuters.
Gabor was able to speak “very little,” though she was conscious, he said.
Gabor was admitted on Friday to the hospital to treat two blood clots, only two days after being released for hip replacement surgery. Gabor broke her hip on July 17 when she fell out of bed while watching the television game show “Jeopardy,” said her publicist John Blanchette.
“Her health has been up and down ever since,” he said.
The Hungarian-born Gabor has appeared in more than 30 movies, and her penchant for calling everyone “dah-ling” in her Hungarian accent made her a well-known Hollywood personality.
She, along with her two glamorous sisters Eva and Magda made several appearances on radio and television shows in the 1950s in the 1950s and 1960s. Zsa Zsa’s first starring role in the movies was in “Moulin Rouge,” followed by “Lili” and later “Touch of Evil.”
Married nine times to a string of husbands that included a Turkish diplomat and the hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, Gabor celebrated her 24th wedding anniversary to Von Anhalt in the hospital on Saturday, said Blanchette.
