China's economy sparks relief rally

Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso said investors were bracing for wose news. ‘‘It’s actually pretty close to market expectations,’’ he said.
The Australian dollar perked up on the release of the closely watched figures. It was recently buying about $US1.016, up from $US1.013 just prior to the release. Local stocks surged about two-thirds of one per cent - equivalent to about $8 billion in value - on the news before paring gains.
