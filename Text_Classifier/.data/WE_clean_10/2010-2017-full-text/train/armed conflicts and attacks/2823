Gunfire heard at military camp in western Ivory Coast town
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Gunfire erupted at a military camp in the western Ivory Coast town of Daloa on Friday, a resident and a military source said, hours after demobilised soldiers seized control of Bouake, the West African nation’s second largest city.
“There is gunfire at the Second Battalion in Daloa. It’s young demobilised soldiers,” said the resident, speaking by telephone from a cocoa processing factory near the army camp.
