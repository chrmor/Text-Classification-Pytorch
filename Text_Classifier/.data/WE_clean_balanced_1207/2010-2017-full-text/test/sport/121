Tiger Woods Returns to No. 1 With Win at Bay Hill
“It feels good to know that all the hard work has paid off to get me to this point,” said Woods, who posted three eagles at Bay Hill, one fewer than he had in all of 2012.
Three times, in 2000, 2003 and 2008, Woods won events before the Masters, including Palmer’s tournament. But there can be no comparing him then with him now. In 2000 and 2003, he was not married, much less divorced with joint custody of two small children. In 2008, knee injuries forced him off the tour for eight months. Those were the days when Woods’s world was neatly compartmentalized, his focus fully on whatever challenges presented themselves between the gallery ropes.
His margin of victory in 2003 was 11 strokes over Stewart Cink, Brad Faxon, Kenny Perry and Kirk Triplett. There is no comparing the competition then and now. The talent pool is deeper, the fields strengthened by a younger generation inspired by Woods to master the sport and replete with games patterned after Woods’s.
It was hardly a surprise that two of the tour’s fresh faces, Fowler, 24, and Bradley, 26, were among those applying the heat on Woods. Fowler was 8 years old in June 1997 when Woods first reached No. 1, where he stayed for 623 nonconsecutive weeks.
Injuries and off-course issues punctured Woods’s aura of invincibility in recent years. Fowler and Bradley joined the tour after Woods’s last major victory, at the 2008 United States Open, so they have never had their psyches bruised by battling Woods at his best. They have absorbed Woods’s strengths but not many of his beatings.
Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion, whose 67 on Sunday stood up as the lowest final-round score, called Woods “the greatest golfer ever.”
Watson said: “But you have to remember, the competition is better. Since he hurt himself, there are younger kids coming up. There are people coming over here and playing more. The whole world is growing, and they know how to train and how to practice because they’ve been watching him. So everyone knows how to get better at the game.”
After watching Woods secure a sixth official tour victory in his past 20 stroke-play starts dating to this event last year, the next generation can sense that its coronation has been put off indefinitely.
“This is the Tiger that I grew up watching,” Bradley said.
The golfers Woods, 37, is chasing now include the game’s best players. He passed Jack Nicklaus on the career victory list last year with his 74th title, and his eight wins at Bay Hill match the record-setting victory total of Sam Snead in Greensboro, N.C. Snead won for the first time there in 1938 and for the last time in 1965. Woods is also five titles from equaling Snead’s career victory total of 82.
“Sam did it for — what? — almost 30 years,” Woods said. “Well into his early 50s, he won. So it speaks to being consistent and just being there. To pass Jack last year, and I’m not that far from Sam, it hasn’t been easy. But also then again, over the course of time, I’ve put myself there so many times that I’d hope I’d cash in a few times along the way.”
Before entering the interview tent to meet with reporters, Woods lingered outside and scrolled through the texts on his smartphone. He could have stood there until nightfall and not thumbed replies to all the messages left by well-wishers.
It made him feel good, he said, which raised a question: when was the last time his game and his life have felt so in sync heading into the year’s first major?
Woods said, “It’s been a few years.”
