Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her new-look frontbench have been officially sworn in by the Governor-General in Canberra.
The incoming ministers have waited over three weeks since the election to take up their new posts while Labor negotiated the formation of a minority government.
This afternoon they were sworn in by Governor-General Quentin Bryce as family members looked on.
Former prime minister Kevin Rudd was among those sworn in and he will soon jet off to the United States as Foreign Minister to hold talks in Washington and New York.
The Opposition has criticised Mr Rudd's appointment as well as the rewarding of factional leaders who were instrumental in removing him as prime minister.
Bill Shorten is now Assistant Treasurer, while David Feeney and Don Farrell have been made parliamentary secretaries.
Ms Gillard was forced to reinstate Warren Snowden as the Minister for Indigenous Health after she was criticised for axing the position.
New Schools Minister Peter Garrett will now have the word education added to his ministerial title following criticism the word was missing from the original line-up.
Research has reappeared in Kim Carr's job description, and the word tertiary has been shoehorned into Chris Evans's new title too.
All up, the Prime Minister has made five changes to titles since unveiling her new ministry on Saturday.
Cabinet is likely to meet soon ahead of Parliament's first sitting day since June on September 28.
