Brit awards 2016 with Adele, Coldplay, Justin Bieber and more – as it happened
Nice modest performance from Adele, there. A backdrop glistening like a galaxy. Big vocals, and a big song with a big message: age, ageing, love, loss – a lifetime of emotions in four minutes.
If you are reading this, Adele: I may have had a bottle of white wine, but I thought, maybe, on your tour, well, maybe I could come on stage for this performance and do an interpretive dance? Nothing fancy, just some gentle cartwheels and some star jumps. Might jazz it up a bit, that’s all. Up to you, obvs.
Anyway, that’s it for the 2016 Brits. My verdict? Catfish frontman Van McCann missed his chance at becoming the next big gobby indie frontman. Adele did really well, as expected. And most importantly, Rihanna, Drake and Lorde seemed to steal the show, which is kind of depressing considering they’re not Brits. And this is the Brit awards.
