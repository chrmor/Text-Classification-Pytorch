KEVIN Sheedy – the man who put the ball in the England net at the Italia '90 World Cup - has been diagnosed with bowel cancer.
The former Ireland and Everton midfielder - who is now the club's academy coach and was an integral part of the all-conquering Everton team of the mid-80s - will undergo surgery later this week.
The 52 year old former international played 369 times for Everton, scoring 97 goals, and is optimistic of making a full recovery after the operation.
"It’s not ideal but I have to remain positive," he said. "There is a history in the family.
"It’s so important that people don’t ignore the early signs and symptoms and don’t be afraid to consult a GP.
"After a period of rehabilitation I will return to my coaching role at Everton."
Ireland were one nil down to an England goal by Gary Lineker in Cagliari, Sardinia, when Sheedy scored a dramatic and crucial equaliser.
Sheedy was a leading member of the team that went on the quarter finals of that World Cup.
He also scored the first penalty in the famous penalty shoot-out against Romania in Genoa.
Elsewhere, the Irish Cancer Society officially opened its Daffodil Centre at Tallaght hospital, where specialist cancer nurses and trained volunteers will support sufferers and their families.
Chief executive John McCormack said its cancer information, support and advice service had been brought to the place of diagnosis and care.
"This is a service not just for the patient - it is for their families and friends and anyone else who has a concern or question about cancer," he said.
"The Society plans to invest 3.6 million euro (£2.8 million) over the next three years in the nationwide rollout of Daffodil Centres across the country."
