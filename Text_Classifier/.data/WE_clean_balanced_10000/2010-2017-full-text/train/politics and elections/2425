Greens Quit Irish Coalition, Bring Vote Closer
DUBLIN—Ireland's Green Party pulled out of the government Sunday, a move that will hasten elections scheduled for March 11 and bring down the curtain on one of the most crisis-racked administrations in Ireland's history.
The Greens, junior partner in the governing coalition, said they still would support legislation underpinning the €67.5 billion ($91.8 billion) international bailout arranged for Ireland last November.
