PGA cancels Grand Slam of Golf at Trump National in Los Angeles
The PGA of America will not hold its Grand Slam of Golf for the major champions this year.
The 36-hole exhibition was supposed to be played in October at Trump National in Los Angeles. The PGA and Donald Trump agreed that it would move away from Trump's course after he received criticism for his remarks about Mexican immigrants while launching his candidacy for U.S. president.
The PGA had been looking for a replacement golf course with suitable dates. But on Thursday the PGA announced it would cancel the event because of the timing and logistics required to stage the exhibition at the "highest standards."
The major champions this year are Jordan Spieth (Masters and U.S. Open), Zach Johnson (British Open) and Jason Day (PGA Championship).
