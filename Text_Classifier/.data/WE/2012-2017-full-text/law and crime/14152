'Star Trek: Voyager' Actress Jennifer Lien Arrested For Indecent Exposure
Former "Star Trek: Voyager" actress Jennifer Lien was arrested in her Harriman, Tennessee, home on Sept. 3 after allegedly exposing herself in front of children, according to multiple reports. 
ABC WATE reports that on Aug. 31 a neighbor passing by the 41-year-old's home commented on her crying children, which led to the actress lashing out at the neighbor with a "vulgar" tirade. 
The neighbor claims that Lien then exposed herself, lifting up her shirt and dropping her pants, all while three children looked on. Lien denied exposing herself, but police issued her a detainer summons, charging her with indecent exposure. 
According to the police report obtained by Variety, when officers later appeared with a warrant on Sept. 3, the actress was naked under a blanket and resisted arrest.
Lien, who appeared on “Star Trek: Voyager” from 1995 to 2000 as Kes, allegedly threatened the arresting officers, claiming she would have all of them shot and killed. She remains in custody at this time. 
Lien has had trouble with the law before. Harriman Police Chief Randy Heidle told The Associated Press that the actress also faces multiple charges, including evading arrest, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment and aggravated assault, all in connection with an incident in April, in which police say she rammed a police cruiser with her vehicle.
