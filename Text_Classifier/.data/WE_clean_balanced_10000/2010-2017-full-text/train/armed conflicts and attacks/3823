Two Yemen bombings strike Aden
Medical workers in the city of Aden in southern Yemen say two explosions there have killed at least one person and injured eight others.
The blasts - within minutes of each other - struck an area of the city near the grounds of a local football team.
It appears the second bomb aimed to strike the emergency services once they had arrived on the scene.
Part of next month's the Gulf Football Championships is due to take place there.
Attacks aimed at the Yemeni security forces or Western targets are often blamed on an al-Qaeda offshoot in Yemen.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was formed more than a year ago when Yemeni and Saudi militant groups merged.
Six days ago, twin attacks on Western targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, left one person dead and at least four injured.
Militants fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a British embassy car, slightly injuring one staff member as well as bystanders, officials said.
In the other incident, a security guard at an Austrian gas company near Sanaa opened fire killing a French contractor and badly injuring a UK contractor.
Yemen has been plagued by decades of poverty and a range of security issues, including a separatist movement and a tribal uprising. Its high numbers of unemployed youths are seen as potential recruits for Islamist militant groups.
More than 40% of Yemen's population live on less than $2 (Â£1.25) a day.
