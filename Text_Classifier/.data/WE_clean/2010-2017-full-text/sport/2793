Robin Soderling seals victory in Paris Masters final
Soderling is ending the season in fine form The world number five raced through the first set before encountering some stronger resistance from Monfils in front of a raucous Parisian crowd. The flamboyant Frenchman pushed Soderling into a second set tiebreak, but the Swede was in control throughout and won it easily to seal victory. The win will see him overtake fourth-placed Andy Murray in the rankings. Soderling, twice French Open runner-up, became the first Swede to win a Masters tournament since Thomas Enqvist in 2000 at Cincinnati. I think you need to believe in yourself and I think that can make a big change. I'm feeling really good right now. "I know it's difficult to lose two finals in a row in this city but Monfils played incredible tennis this week," said Soderling. "Of course, winning matches against a lot of good players this week gives me a lot of confidence. "Playing in any Masters, when you play the top players of the world, every match can be a grand slam final. "I think you need to believe in yourself and I think that can make a big change. I'm feeling really good right now." The 26-year-old Swede played aggressively and his powerful service game proved too much for the Frenchman, who suffered his second successive final defeat in Bercy. In the first set, Soderling won eight of 10 net points and hit 12 winners, braking the Frenchman in the fourth, when Monfils hit a forehand volley wide, and again in the sixth. The Frenchman raised his game in the second set as the Swede's first serve percentage dropped, but errors in the tie-break, where he dropped three points, allowed Soderling to seal his maiden Masters title. Well done Robin on winning your first Masters title and getting to a career high ranking of four Monfils, who will lead France against Serbia in the Davis Cup final in Belgrate on 3-5 December, said: "I've had a week full of emotions. "I've learnt a lot, I've gone to the extent of my limits and I'm very, very disappointed to have got so close again and to have lost the final so easily. "But third time lucky, I hope to be in the final again next year."
