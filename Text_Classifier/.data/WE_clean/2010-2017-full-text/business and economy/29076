Alaska Air-Virgin America Merger Gets U.S. Approval
The Justice Department on Tuesday approved Alaska Air Group Inc.â€™s acquisition of Virgin America Inc., but imposed conditions requiring Alaska Air to scale back its route partnership with American Airlines Group Inc.
The $2.6 billion merger deal, struck in April, would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline by traffic, surpassing JetBlue Airways Corp., which lost a bidding war with Alaska Air for Virgin America.
