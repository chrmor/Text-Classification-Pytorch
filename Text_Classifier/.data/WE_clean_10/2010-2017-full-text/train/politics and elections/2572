Independence referendum: Who are the 'Better Together' backers?
"We make a positive case for staying together. A positive case that celebrates not just what makes us distinctive but also celebrates what we share. We put the positive case for staying together. We are positive about our links with the rest of the UK, through families and friendships, through trade and through shared political, economical and cultural institutions." "Better Together is about giving the shipbuilder from Glasgow to the nanny in Inverness a voice in the biggest decision Scotland has faced in 300 years. The future of the United Kingdom is about the future aspirations of a majority of ordinary Scots, who want to remain part of one of the most successful economic and political unions in the world."
"We welcome the fact that the three pro-UK parties in Scotland have come together to make the positive case for Scotland in the United Kingdom. We share the view that Scotland and all of the nations of the UK are stronger together - on the economy and jobs, on defence and security, on our influence in the world and so much more." "Today's Better Together launch marks the formal beginning of a positive campaign for a stronger Scotland in the United Kingdom. Devolution gives Scots the powers to take decisions over domestic issues within the strong and secure framework of the UK. That's a relationship that delivers in Scotland's interests."
Winner of Miss Inverness 2010 and a professional nanny to four children "We have a massive 300 year history and I believe that our generation of children should be a part of that. My boyfriend is down at Sandhurst at the moment, he is going through his training to become an Army officer. I think I speak for everyone when I say how I am immensely proud of our armed forces." Born in Inverness, grew up in Strathpether and studying at Edinburgh University "I am at Edinburgh University doing Scottish history and English language joint honours. That has given me a sort of perspective of Scotland where you really delve into and get to know the past more than just the folk stories. From my studies it is undeniable that the Union has been good for Scotland historically, but it is not about the history, it is about the future."
English born resident of Scotland for more than 30 years "I was brought up to think of myself as British so whether I lived in England, Scotland or Wales, really did not matter. I had a British passport and when I went abroad I was just British. We have more things in common then we have different. I definitely believe we have more clout together on the world stage then we would as a separate nation." "We want to keep the stamp of the Clyde on the ships - built on the Clyde, that is the history of the place. There is a great fear that independence will take that away. We have been together, we have worked together, we have even fought together and, as the slogan says, we will be better together."
"Not many girls come back home to farming, but I enjoy the daily challenges and faming is constantly evolving. Scottish farming plays a part within the UK - you have all the companies that come from Northern Ireland, England and Wales supporting Scottish faming. We rely on them as much as they rely on us." "The shipyards to me mean being part of an extended family. My great grandmother, my grandfather also worked there. I have been there myself for the last 23 years. I want my children and my children's children to have that same opportunity, to follow on in the family footsteps. That is one of the reasons I will be voting no to Scottish independence."
