Alaska earthquake: Strong tremor strikes off Atka Island
The earthquake, which struck at 9:06 a.m. local time on Saturday, was centered about 51 miles (82 km) south of Atka, which is a small town located on the eastern side of Atka Island. It struck about 19.9 miles (32 km) deep, making it a shallow earthquake. The U.S. Tsunami Warning Center said the earthquake was not strong enough to generate a tsunami, and no tsunami alerts have been issued, though the earthquake was likely felt on islands across the region. The tsunami warning center initially measured the earthquake at 6.4, but the United States Geological Survey (USGS) later downgraded the magnitude to 6.3. Other details about Saturday's earthquake were not immediately available, and there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the sparsely-populated region.
