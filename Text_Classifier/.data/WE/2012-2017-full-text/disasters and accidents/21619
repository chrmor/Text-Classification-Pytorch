Queensland schools closed, workers ordered home
South-east Queensland is shutting down, workers are going home and more than 2000 schools are closed as the region braces for flash flooding from up to half a metre of rain expected to fall in the next 24 hours.
Ex-tropical cyclone Debbie is drenching the south-east, with flooding already closing some roads in the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Brisbane areas.
The Queensland government has ordered every school in the region to shut, from Agnes Waters in the north, the NSW border in the south and west to Nanango.
This includes 763 state schools, 1286 Catholic and private schools and 546 child care centres.
