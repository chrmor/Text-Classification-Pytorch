Bashir arrested in terrorism investigation
Radical Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir was detained this morning by anti-terrorism police, police and his lawyer said.
Indonesian police say Bashir was actively involved in a terrorist training camp uncovered in the Indonesian province of Aceh this year and appointed the notorious terrorist Dulmatin as field commander.
He blessed the camp and provided financing for it, it was alleged.
Bashir has been in the sights of police for months after members of his organisation, Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid, were arrested in relation to the terrorist cell, which was uncovered in February.
Bashir gained infamy in Australia for his praise of the Bali bombers and was briefly imprisoned for his alleged role in the 2002 attacks.
