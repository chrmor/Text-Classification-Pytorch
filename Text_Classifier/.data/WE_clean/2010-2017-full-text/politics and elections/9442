Prince William ready for Falklands duty with RAF
The Duke of Cambridge has arrived in the Falklands ahead of a tour of duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot.
Prince William, whose younger brother Prince Harry served in Afghanistan in 2008, will have a six-week posting.
It comes amid tensions between the UK and Argentina, where the disputed territory is known as the Malvinas.
The Royal Navy will send one of its latest warships, the Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless, to the region on her maiden mission in the months ahead.
Dauntless is expected to replace the frigate HMS Montrose in the area.
The Royal Navy has said the Portsmouth-based destroyer's deployment has been planned for a long time, and is not a reaction to heightened tensions over the Falklands.
The Ministry of Defence has said Prince William's posting - as part of an RAF crew of four - is a "routine deployment" for a Sea King pilot as part of "normal" squadron rotation.
Buenos Aires has described it as a "provocative act" and said the duke would be wearing "the uniform of a conqueror" when he deploys.
Argentina's foreign ministry said it "rejected the British attempt to militarise conflict".
UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner have accused each other's countries of "colonial" behaviour concerning sovereignty of the South Atlantic islands.
Gen Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, has dismissed Argentine claims of a "political" aspect to the duke's deployment.
"I can absolutely tell you it wasn't and isn't designed to be," he said.
Britain has held the islands since the 1830s, but Argentina insists it has a prior claim.
Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge at home in the UK will have the company of a new family member - a cocker spaniel puppy - while her husband is in the Falklands.
