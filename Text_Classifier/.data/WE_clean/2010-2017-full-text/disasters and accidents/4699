1.05pm: Some background on the aircraft involved in the Cork crash and the airport's safety history from our transport correspondent Dan Milmo:
"Cork airport was in the headlines four years ago when the conduct of Ryanair pilots was questioned by the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit. In 2006 the IAAIU reported on a "serious incident" involving a Ryanair plane attempting to land at Cork in June 2005. The captain failed to perform a standard "go-around" after aborting a landing and instead banked in a tight circle to try again minutes later, bringing the plane within 425 feet of the ground and alarming local residents. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the incident did not stem from the airline's fast turnarounds and low-cost culture but was due to "jet jockeys" attempting irregular manoeuvres. The airplane that crashed today, a Metroliner, has been involved in a number of accidents over the years. One aviation expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Fairchild Metroliner aircraft involved in the crash is a popular commuter plane that has been involved in crashes before owing to its use in "interesting" parts of the world such as Latin America. The 19-seater plane was first introduced in the 1970s and is manufactured in Texas. The expert said it appeared likely that pilot error played a role in the incident. "It is always a worry if you have two attempts to land and it does not work - it indicates that the conditions were marginal. It would have been a better idea to divert to another airport at that point." Last year the Polish President, Lech Kaczinski, was among the 96 victims when a Polish government plane attempted to land at Smolensk airport in thick fog. Russian officials said the pilots had ignored warnings about the conditions from local air traffic control. The crash comes amid signs that the improvement in aviation safety, which has made significant gains since the 1990s, is stalling. The global death toll from air crashes rose by 13% to 828 last year as the fatal accident rate worsened from one per 1.5m flights in 2009 to one in every 1.3m flights in 2010. The Ascend consultancy, which produced the figures, described 2010 as a "poor" year for the industry with aircraft insurance claims reaching their highest total of $1.1bn (£685m)."
12.58pm: The Health Service Executive (HSE) have said four of the injured are in a serious condition and the other two injured are "comfortable".
12.50pm: East Belfast MP Naomi Long, whose constituency includes the City Airport where the flight took off, said: "It is a very dark day for both Belfast and Cork. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been killed or injured, and I know that the whole community will be thinking of them at this difficult time, and would join with me in wishing those who have survived a full recovery."
Ulster Unionist leader Tom Elliott said: "Like everyone else in Northern Ireland I was shocked to learn that a Belfast to Cork commuter flight crashed this morning, resulting in a number of fatalities and injuries. This is a terrible tragedy."
12.21pm: Some further details about this morning's crash:
The Fairchild aircraft left Belfast around twelve minutes past eight this morning and was due to land at Cork Airport around 9am.
Conditions around Cork Airport were described as foggy and the plane had to make Category 2 Low Visibility approach at the time of the landing. The plane tried to land initially on runway 17 at Cork but failed to do so and circled above. An attempt was then made to land on an adjacent runway 35 but again was unable to. It was on the second approach into runway 17 that the plane crashed and burst into flames.
A spokesperson for a hospital nearby dealing with the victims said the passengers and crew were suffering from burns and multiple injuries. The Republic's Department of Transport will now initiate an air accident investigation into the fatal crash.
12.18pm: Henry McDonald writes that the Bishop of Cork revealed today that he has spoken with relatives of some of those on the flight. They had been waiting for loved ones at Cork Airport this morning, the Bishop said. Bishop John Buckley said he told the relatives that "the thoughts and prayers of the people of Cork and the people of Ireland were with them."
