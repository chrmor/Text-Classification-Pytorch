Brazil's Sao Paulo hit by deadly floods and mudslides
Floods and mudslides triggered by heavy rains have killed at least 13 people in the city of Sao Paulo and the rest of the state, Brazilian officials say.
Most died when mudslides swept away their homes.
Brazil has seen severe flooding this year which has left thousands homeless and dozens dead in the south-east of the country.
The torrential downpours began on Monday night, causing rivers to burst their banks. Rescue services reported a dozen landslides.
Brazilian television described Tuesday's rush hour in Sao Paulo as "chaotic".
Officials say that the first few days of January have seen nearly as much as is normal in the entire month.
