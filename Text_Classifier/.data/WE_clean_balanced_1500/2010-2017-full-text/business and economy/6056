Call of duty: Black Ops II sales hit $500 million in first 24 hours
Activision claimed that “for the fourth consecutive year, the Call of Duty franchise has delivered the biggest entertainment launch of the year.”
The cross-platform release dwarves the $220m (£138m) recently taken by the new Halo 4 in its first day, although that title is only available on Xbox.
The Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 figures come from Chart-Track, retail customer sell-through information and internal company estimates, Activision said.
Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said “Life-to-date sales for the Call of Duty franchise have exceeded worldwide theatrical box office receipts for “Harry Potter” and “Star Wars,” the two most successful movie franchises of all time.” He added, however “Given the challenged macro-economic environment, we remain cautious about the balance of 2012 and 2013.”
There were more than 16,000 midnight openings at shops around the world for the November 13 launch of Call of Duty. It was a top trending topic globally on Twitter in 23 cities worldwide and there have been more than 30 million YouTube video views of the game’s live-action ‘Surprise’ launch trailer since its release on October 29, 2012.
The game has met with largely positive reviews, although The Telegraph’s Mike Clayton sounded a note of caution for future releases: “Black Ops II is still ostensibly built on the same foundations that powered 2007's Call of Duty 4 and every annual instalment of the series thereafter. The thrill of Call of Duty's rollercoaster ride is starting to diminish, then, but few will feel too short-changed by buying this year's ticket,” he said.
