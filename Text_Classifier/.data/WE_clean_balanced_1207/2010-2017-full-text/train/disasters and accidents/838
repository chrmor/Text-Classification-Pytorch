18 Garment Workers Killed in Crash, Official Says
Eighteen garment workers were killed and 21 injured Tuesday morning when the van they were traveling in on their way to work in Svay Rieng province crashed with a tourist bus, according to an Interior Ministry official.
“There are 18 who died, seven seriously injured…and 14 with minor injuries,” said Run Rathvesna, chief of the Interior Ministry’s public order department. “They are at three hospitals: Chi Phu referral hospital, Svay Rieng hospital, and another clinic.”
Svay Rieng provincial military police chief On Soeung said the driver of the bus, which was operated by the 15 SH Transport company, was arrested after sustaining minor injuries in the crash in Svay Teap district. Pav Sina, president of the Collective Union of Movement of Workers, said the garment workers were members of his union and that at least five remained in a serious condition Tuesday morning. “Five victims are now receiving urgent medical treatment at Chi Phu referral hospital in Bavet City,” he said. Chan Dara, director of the Svay Rieng Provincial Referral Hospital, said that the bodies of the deceased were being cleaned at the hospital before being returned to their families.
Correction: Previous versions of this story incorrectly stated the district in which the accident occurred. Additionally, the garment workers were traveling in a van, not a truck.
