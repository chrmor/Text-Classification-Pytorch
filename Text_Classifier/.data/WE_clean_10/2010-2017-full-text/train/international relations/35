Cuba seeks strong trade ties with China
Cuba has signed a series of economic agreements with China coinciding with a visit to Beijing by leader Raul Castro. The four-day visit, which began on Thursday, has offered Castro a first-hand look at Chinese economic reforms.
The pacts inked on Thursday include a grant and interest-free loan to the Cuban government for economic and technological co-operation. They also inculde a credit line to support Cuban health care and other public services, but further details were not given.
The signings followed talks in which Castro told Hu Jintao, China's president, that relations between the two nations were deepening and broadening.
The trip is Castro's first to China since taking over from his brother in 2008. Cuba watchers have speculated he would study China's mix of socialism and market liberalisation of which he spoke approvingly during a 1997 visit.
Asked what Cuba could learn, Liu Weimin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said China was eager to share its experiences.
"We consider that mutual communications benefit helping countries adopt a suitable model for economic and social development depending on concrete local conditions," Liu told reporters at a briefing.
Cuba is China's biggest commercial partner in the Caribbean. Beijing helped prop up the Cuban economy after the withdrawal of Russian aid in the 1990s.
Though both communist nations, China has opened broadly to private business and has thrived economically while Cuba remains largely poor.
