Christchurch quake: Latest updates
That concludes our Christchurch earthquake updates for this evening. They will resume from early tomorrow morning.
A construction manager who joined rescue efforts after the earthquake describes rescuers using a hacksaw to cut off a man's leg to free him after he was pinned under concrete.
Fred Haering says rescuers used sledgehammers and chain saws to cut into the collapsed Pyne Gould Guinness building from the roof, slicing downward through layers of sandwiched offices and finding bodies crushed under concrete slabs.
One man had a leg pinned under concrete, and a doctor administered medicine to deaden his pain. A fireman asked Haering for a hacksaw. Haering handed it over and tried to avert his eyes as the man's leg was sawed off, saving him from certain death.
Haering says: "It's a necessity of the game."

"Any foreign national whose travel plans have been disrupted by the earthquake will similarly be granted a visa extension to allow them to remain legally in New Zealand for the reasonable duration of their visit."
Cash donations are the best way to support people affected by the Christchurch earthquake, Civil Defence Minister John Carter says.
"Donations of money are the quickest and easiest way to help organisations on the ground get exactly what they need," he said tonight.
"That way, affected people can make their own choices about putting their lives back together and what's more, money spent locally helps the local economy at a crucial time."
Mr Carter said if people offered goods it would be some time before they could be handled.
"Staff need to focus solely on saving lives and protecting the public at this stage," he said.
"Down the track, if there's a need for specific goods to be donated we will make a public call."
Mr Carter said cash donations could be made through the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and any ANZ, National Bank, ASB, BNZ or Kiwibank branch.

Ms Bennett said of those contacted so far, two required emergency help, 11 needed home visits, 24 were referred to welfare centres and the rest were either going to stay with family or were fine where they were.
"One elderly gentleman in his eighties had suffered injuries in a fall - he said he didn't want to bother anyone but obviously we arranged to get him to a doctor," Ms Bennett said.

British High Commissioner Vicki Treadell is among those scrambling to track people down in Christchurch's disaster zone.

"I personally spoke to about 30 of them this morning and I've got staff on the ground who are getting their details."
A number of Britons had been taken to Christchurch Hospital, although Ms Treadell said hospital staff had told her none were in intensive care.
"They're...going round all those who have been admitted to try to find out who they are, and we're hoping that during the course of tonight, certainly by tomorrow morning, we'll have confirmation."
Ms Treadell said concerns were being raised by people in Britain about loved ones caught up in the quake.
"I think our hotline in London is getting a lot of phone calls from family and friends worried about loved ones that they know are in this part of the world. Whether or not they are in Christchurch we don't know."

He said the officers would go some time in the next week and it was believed they will assist local officers to ensure the safety of the Christchurch community.
"Obviously their own police officers are flat out in trying to assist the New Zealand public and we want to keep them as safe as possible so our police officers, I imagine, will support the constables in New Zealand," Mr Johnson said.

People who cross police cordons in quake-ravaged central Christchurch could be arrested, superintendent Dave Cliff says.
A "large" number of cordons were in place to restrict access to high risk areas.
People who enter those areas without permission could be arrested under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, Mr Cliff said.
