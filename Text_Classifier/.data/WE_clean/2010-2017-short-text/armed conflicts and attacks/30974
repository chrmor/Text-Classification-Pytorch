Shortly after bombing Syrian government and allied troops near Al-Tanf, the United States shoots down a Iranian-made Syrian government drone that was flying toward U.S.-led coalition forces in southern Syria. There are no injuries or damage. An American official says this is first time forces supporting Damascus have attacked coalition troops. (Reuters) (AP via The Washington Post) (CNN)
