Ricky Hatton tried to kill himself 'several times' while battling depression
Former two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton has revealed he tried to kill himself several times during his battle with depression.
Hatton admitted there was a huge gap in his life after retiring from a boxing career that saw him take on the likes of Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao in front of his army of supporters in Las Vegas.
"I tried to kill myself several times," Hatton said in an interview aired on BBC Radio 4.
"I used to go to the pub, come back, take the knife out and sit there in the dark crying hysterically.
"There were times when I hadn't had a drink for days and I'd still come home and if something went through my mind I'd start pondering something. It was the same outcome whether I was having a drink or wasn't having a drink.
"But in the end I thought I'll end up drinking myself to death because I was so miserable.
