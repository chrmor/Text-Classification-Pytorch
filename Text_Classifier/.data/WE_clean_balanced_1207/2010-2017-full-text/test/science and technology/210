ESA's PLATO deep-space observatory to join hunt for new planets
A new observatory to be built and sent into deep-space to search out habitable planets has been approved by the European Space Agency.
Dubbed PLATO, the mission may fundamentally change what humanity believes of its place in the universe.
PLATO is going to "address fundamental questions such as 'how common are Earth-like planets?' and 'is our solar system unusual or even unique?'," according to the University of Warwick, whose scientists are involved in the project.
It "could eventually even lead to the detection of extra-terrestrial life," the university added.
Following a meeting of the European Space Agency's committee in Madrid, the mission has now received the official green light, meaning it will now move from the blueprint phase into proper construction.
It is expected to cost €600m (£536m).
The spacecraft is going to have 26 telescopes and will join NASA's Kepler observatory as a spacecraft dedicated to finding exoplanets, planets revolving around stars other than our Sun.
Kepler was launched in 2009 and has found more than 3,400 exoplanets to-date.
PLATO will be launched nearly one million miles away from Earth in 2026, more than four times further away than the moon.
It will scan a huge area of the sky, searching for the slight dips in light that takes place when a planet "transits" between the star and the telescope observing it.
