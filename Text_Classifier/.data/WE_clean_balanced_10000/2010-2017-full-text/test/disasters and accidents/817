Magnitude-5.1 quake hits Albuera, Leyte
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 23) — Two people died in the magnitude-5.1 quake that hit Leyte Wednesday.
Supt. Elma Delos Santos, spokesperson of the Ormoc City Police, identified the victims as 51-year-old Maria Contreras Colasito from Barangay Naungan, and 70-year-old Rodita Baloro from Barangay San Jose. Both barangays are in Ormoc City.
Colasito fell and hit her head on the pavement during the quake, while Baloro suffered a heart attack a few minutes after the tremor, police told CNN Philippines.
The earthquake struck at 6:26 a.m., five kilometers (kms) from Albuera, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.
Phivolcs said that aftershocks are expected from Wednesday's quake, but no damage is expected. No reports of injuries have yet been received from authorities.
The quake had reported intensities of 5 (strong) in Ormoc City;  4 (moderately strong) in Pastrana, Leyte; and 3 (weak) in Tacloban City and Palo, Leyte, it added. Intensity measures the strength of the shaking from an earthquake.
The quake prompted the Ormoc City government to suspend classes in all levels. Ormoc, the provincial capital of Leyte, is 21 kms north from Albuera.
Wednesday's quake comes more than six weeks after a magnitude-6.5 quake killed two and injured 72 in Jaro, Leyte last July 6.
Ormoc and some neighboring towns were placed under a state of calamity on August 7 to hasten relief and rehabilitation there.
