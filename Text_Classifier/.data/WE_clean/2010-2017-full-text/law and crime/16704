18 killed in stampede at boxing match in Indonesia
JAKARTA, Indonesia – Police said at least 18 people have been killed in a stadium stampede after spectators rioted to protest a local boxer’s loss in a championship match in eastern Indonesia.
Lt. Col. Gede Sumerta Jaya said Monday the victims were trampled as about 1,500 spectators scrambled out the stadium when a riot broke out just before midnight Sunday.
The local boxer lost on points in the championship match for the Bupati Cup, or Regent Cup, at Kota Lama Sport Stadium in the Papua province town of Nabire.
Jaya said the riot began after the boxer’s supporters threw chairs at the judges. He said 12 of the dead were women, and at least 47 other spectators were injured and hospitalized.
Police and soldiers were deployed to stop the fighting.
