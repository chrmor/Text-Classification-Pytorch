KUNA : Military plane crashes in Spain, pilot killed, 19 injured
MADRID, May 5 (KUNA) -- A military aircraft crashed into the hangar of police helicopters during an airshow in the outskirts of Madrid on Sunday, killing one person and injuring 19 others. The pilot succumbed to his fatal injuries at the hospital where he was rushed along with 19 other persons who were wounded while the authorities opened urgent investigations to determine the cause of the tragedy. The Casa Saeta twin engine jet plane, made in the 1950s, exploded, sending a large fireball into the air, the state-run TV station RTVE reported. The accident took place at Cuatro Vientos Airport where more than 3,000 people gathered to watch the aerial acrobatics and vintage aircraft; the accident was just 100 meters away from the spectators. The airshow is regularly organized by the Spanish 'Museo del Aire' (aviation museum) in the first Sunday of each month. More than 20 fatalities have resulted from similar accidents in Spain since 1984. (end) hnd.gb KUNA 052157 May 13NNNN
