Chinese Driver Runs Down Students
HONG KONG — A man angry over a court ruling in the case of his daughter’s murder used his car to run down a group of high school students in northern China, causing 13 to be hospitalized with injuries, the local government and the state news media reported on Tuesday. It was the second major attack on students in China in less than two weeks.
The man, Yin Tiejun, 48, ran down 23 students at the school in Fengning County, in Hebei Province, during their lunch break on Monday, the Xinhua news agency reported. He then tried to set fire to his car by igniting a container of diesel fuel. Xinhua quoted the police as saying he was upset that the court had not sentenced all of his daughter’s killers to death. Mr. Yin was detained on charges of endangering public safety.
One of the hospitalized students suffered a serious head injury, while another had two broken ankles and a third had a concussion, the local government said.
The Beijing Times said the driver made no apparent effort to slow down before hitting the students and did not stop until he hit a taxi soon after.
As with the previous attack, in which a man with a meat cleaver injured 23 students in adjacent Henan Province on Dec. 14, the episode received limited attention from the state news media. The Chinese media have given heavy coverage instead to the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and the shootings on Monday of four firefighters, two of whom died, in Webster, N.Y.
