Passenger plane crashes in Congolese town of Goma
KINSHASA (Reuters) - A small plane carrying passengers and cargo crashed on Monday in the eastern Congolese town of Goma, a Reuters witness said.
It was not immediately clear how many people were on board or how many casualties there were.
Democratic Republic of Congo has one of the worldâ€™s worst air safety records. There have been numerous crashes in Goma, where the runway has not been fully repaired after a volcanic eruption in 2002 left it covered in lava.
