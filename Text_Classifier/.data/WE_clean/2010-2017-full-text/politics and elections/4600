Tens of thousands of opposition demonstrators took to the streets in Belgrade on Saturday to protest economic hardship and corruption, and demand early elections.
The rally was called by the nationalist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), the strongest among the country's opposition bloc.
"We give them two months," SNS head Tomislav Nikolic told the crowd, vowing to stage continued protests if the government would not yield to the opposition's demands. He said the popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia had sent a message to governments around the world to listen to the demands of their people.
According to police, some 50,000 people attended the peaceful protests, while local journalists put the number as high as 70,000. The SNS had organized free bus and train transports so that people from all over the country could attend the demonstration.
The center of Belgrade had been blocked by the police to make way for the rally, and authorities were able to successfully prevent a group of football hooligans from clashing with the protesters.
