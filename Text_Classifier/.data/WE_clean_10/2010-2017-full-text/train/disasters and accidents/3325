Valais cantonal police say three German ski tourers have been killed by an avalanche on Friday in the mountains near Ayer.
The avalanche swept away nine people in all – one person is injured and five managed to escape, it has been reported.
The group came from the Friedrichshafen area of Germany on Lake Constance. No more details have been released.
Rescuers said the avalanche was “gigantic”, around 500 metres long and 500 metres across.
The incident happened close to where five French snowshoers and cross-country skiers were killed in a snowslide less than a week ago.
Warmer weather means avalanches are common in the Alps in spring.
