HONG KONGâ€”Authorities met little resistance as they began clearing the main Hong Kong protest site on Thursday, effectively ending an occupation that has stretched out over more than 10 weeks.
Crowds thinned at the site before the action began around 10:30 a.m., and those who stayed said they would likely allow themselves to be arrested peacefully.
