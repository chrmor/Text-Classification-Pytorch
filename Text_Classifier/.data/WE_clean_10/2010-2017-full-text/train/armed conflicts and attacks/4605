2 dead in attack at Old City of Jerusalem
Two people were killed in a stabbing attack at the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem early Wednesday afternoon, officials said.
One of the victims died of stab wounds sustained during the attack, according to Israeli police. The second victim was shot by accident by Israeli security forces aiming at the attackers.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said there were two attackers, one who was fatally shot at the scene and one who died at a hospital. Both attackers were armed with knives, police said.
Video from the scene showed police cordoning off the area and debris scattered along the stone walls around where investigators were examining evidence.
An organization representing Argentina's Jewish community, known as DAIA, identified one of the victims as as Rabbi Eduardo Birmajer, an Argentine.
"DAIA offers its deepest sympathy to the family of Rabbi Birmajer, and strongly condemns this heinous crime against a helpless civilian -- a fact that is repeated almost daily in Israel, and that this time, has cost the life of a spiritual guide belonging to the Argentine Jewish community," the group said in a statement.
