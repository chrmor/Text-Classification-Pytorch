Jailed Leeds fan Aaron Cawley binged on lager, cider and vodka before attacking Sheffield Wednesday's Chris Kirkland
The 21 year-old, who had been widely named on Twitter before his arrest and identified from Sky Sports coverage of the Yorkshire derby between Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday last Friday, pleaded guilty at Sheffield Magistrates Court to assault and entering the field of play.
Despite the swift action to find and punish Cawley, some, including Leeds chairman Ken Bates, feel he has been treated too leniently.
An official Leeds United club statement confirmed he would be banned from Elland Road for life and added: “While we are pleased to see justice brought so quickly our one disappointment is that we feel the sentence could, and should, have been considerably longer.”
Trenton Oldfield, who stopped the University Boat Race between Cambridge and Oxford by swimming across the River Thames earlier this year, was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance.
Sheffield Magistrates Court heard Cawley, who is from Cheltenham, had been the subject of two football banning orders in the past, which he had breached four times. He claimed he had drunk several cans of strong lager, three-quarters of a litre bottle of vodka and seven to 10 pints of cider before the game.
Cawley also claimed he had no recollection of the attack until he received a text message from a friend while he was on the train home.
Cawley apologised to both clubs via email, but his behaviour has none the less been condemned by Bates, who fears his actions have again tarnished the image of the club and their supporters.
“What is encouraging is that I am told the vast majority of Leeds fans were as appalled by what happened as everyone else,” Bates told the Yorkshire Post. “The idiot who ran on the pitch better not go anywhere near Elland Road again. There are a lot of people angered by what he did.
“We have been working hard as a club to improve our image over the past few years. But this guy has done so much damage to that. It isn’t fair on the overwhelming majority of Leeds fans. It doesn’t do any of us any good.”
The Football Association is continuing its own investigation into an ugly evening at Hillsborough before deciding whether to impose fines.
Several Leeds fans invaded the pitch following Michael Tonge’s equaliser, while there were also reports of bottles, seats and coins being thrown inside the stadium.
