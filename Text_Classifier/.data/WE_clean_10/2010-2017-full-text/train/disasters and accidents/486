Turkey earthquake 2011 death toll rises: 270 killed and over 1,300 injured
A desperate rescue operation is continuing today in a bid to contain the death toll following a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey.
in the east of the country, collapsing hundreds of buildings into piles of twisted steel and chunks of concrete.
In the immediate aftermath of the quake desperate survivors dug into the rubble with their bare hands, trying to rescue the trapped and injured.
The worst hit area was Ercis, a town of 75,000 close to the Iranian border in one of Turkey's most earthquake-prone zones, where more than 100 buildings have collapsed.
Survivors: Amid the tragic death toll are amazing stories of people surviving the quake against all odds Grief stricken: A man weeps as he holds the body of his young daughter, during a makeshift burial at a cemetery in Ercis, one of the hardest hit cities Sources say 272 have been confirmed killed and more than 1,300 injured, but officials estimate that the death toll could rise further as a result of low housing standards in the area and the size of the quake. Ten of the victims were students learning about the Quran at a religious school that collapsed. But Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said search efforts there were winding down. He said he expected the death toll in Ercis to rise, but not as substantially as the 1,000-plus figure initially feared. He added: 'As the rescue work progresses, there is a possibility of the Ercis death toll increasing but the figures are not likely to be scary numbers. There could be around 100 people [in the rubble]. But we are not talking about thousands.' Emergency staff in Ercis have been forced to treat injured people outdoors as hospital buildings were badly damaged.
Some 2,400 rescue workers are involved in the relief effort, as are 680 medics, 12 rescue dogs, 108 ambulances - including seven air ambulances - it added.
Tens of thousands have been sleeping outside in freezing conditions.
We stayed outdoors all night, I could not sleep at all. My children, especially the little one, was terrified. I grabbed her and rushed out when the quake hit, we were all screaming.'
The tragic loss of so many lives has been accompanied by amazing tales of survival.
Yalcin Akay was dug from a collapsed six-storey building with a leg injury after he called a police emergency line on his phone and described his location.
Three other people, including two children, were also rescued from the same building in the city of Ercis some 20 hours after the quake struck, officials said.
Later, a 21-year-old woman, Tugba Altinkaynak, was rescued after being trapped beneath rubble for some 27-hours.
More than 200 aftershocks have rattled the region, hampering rescue work and keeping residents from returning to their homes.
Turkey is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because it sits on major geological fault lines.
Two earthquakes in 1999 with a magnitude of more than 7 killed almost 20,000 people in densely populated parts of the north-west of the country.
'The hospital has been badly damaged, so we can't operate inside.
'We're giving care in the hospital garden and at a nearby building with a generator.
'There should be more than 100 dead bodies left next to the hospital. We left them there because it's dark and we didn't want to step on bodies.'
An eight-storey building with shops underneath was flattened. Residents sobbed outside the ruins, hoping that missing relatives would be rescued.
'My wife and child are inside! My four-month-old baby is inside!'
Witnesses said eight people were rescued from the rubble, but frequent aftershocks were hampering search efforts.     
'There are so many dead, but we don't know the number,' town mayor
'We are waiting for emergency help, it's very urgent. We need tents urgently and rescue teams. We don't have any ambulances, and we only have one hospital. We have many killed and injured.'
The Turkish Red Crescent reported its rescuers pulled several injured people out of a collapsed dormitory in the town, which sits on a geological fault line.
Camps were being set up to shelter people and blankets, food and water were being sent along with mobile kitchens. Military aircraft were helping with the rescue and relief efforts.
Emergency teams were trying to rescue people believed to be trapped in a building in Van, a near the Iranian border, state-run news agency Anatolian said
Residents ran onto the streets in panic as 50 wounded were taken to the hospital there, but it was not known how serious their injuries were. They were treated in the courtyard of the hospital, the state-run Anatolia news agency said.
The situation appeared chaotic as night fell, with too few officials on hand to manage as aftershocks continued to rock the city.
Some people sat outside their houses on the street in the bitter cold. The centre of the city was pitch black after the quake cut power. Some residents dragged suitcases along the streets, trying to salvage what little personal belongings they could find from their crumpled homes.
Halil Celik said a building collapsed before his eyes, with an untold number of people inside.
He said: 'All of a sudden, a quake tore down the building in front of me. All the bystanders, we all ran to the building and rescued two injured people from the ruins.
'We heard cries and groaning from underneath the debris, we are waiting for the rescue teams to arrive.'
Turkey's Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute estimated that between 500 and 1,000 people could have perished.
Foreign Secretary William Hague has offered UK help to Turkey and sent his 'deepest condolences' to friends and loved ones of those affected.
He said: 'The UK is ready to provide assistance, in line with any request from the Turkish authorities. We stand with Turkey at this difficult time.'
Mustafa Erdik, head of the Kandilli observatory said: 'We are estimating a death toll between 500 and 1,000.'
'There are many people under the rubble,' Veysel Keser, mayor of Celebibag, told NTV. 'People are in agony, we can hear their screams for help. We need urgent help."
'It's a great disaster. Many buildings have collapsed, student dormitories, hotels and gas stations have collapsed.'
Some houses also collapsed in the province of Bitlis, where at least one person, an eight-year-old girl was killed, authorities said. The quake also toppled the minarets of two mosques in the nearby province of Mus.
Television pictures showed damaged buildings and vehicles, crushed under falling masonry, and shocked residents wandering in the streets.
Turkish media said phone lines and electricity had been cut off. Aftershocks continued after the initial quake, whose epicentre was at the village of Tabanli, north of Van city.
In Hakkari, a town around 100 km (60 miles) south of the city of Van in southeastern Turkey, a building could be felt swaying for around 10 seconds during the quake. There was no immediate sign of any casualties.
Two large quakes in 1999 killed more than 20,000 people in northwest Turkey. Two people were killed and 79 injured in May when an earthquake shook Simav in northwest Turkey.
The quake also caused panic among residents in several Iranian towns, close to the Turkish border, and caused cracks in some buildings in Chaldoran and cut telephone links, said the Iranian state TV website.
The quake was also felt in Salmas, Maku, Khoi and several other towns in northeastern Iran but no damage has been reported.
