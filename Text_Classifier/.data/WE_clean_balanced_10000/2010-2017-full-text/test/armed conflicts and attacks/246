SDF forces attack ISIS east of Euphrates, capture dam
ERBIL, Kurdistan Region--Fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attacked Islamic State positions east of the Euphrates Saturday, killing a number of militants and controlling a strategic bridge. The SDF also took the Tishreen Dam from ISIS. Rami Abdel Rahman, an SDF officer, told the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that eastern Euphrates is now cleared of ISIS and "the battles are now on the western bank of the river." Tishreen Dam, held by ISIS for over a year, generates electricity for parts of Aleppo Province.  The SDF is a coalition of Arab, Assyrian, Kurdish and Turkmen forces.  The Peoples Protection Units (YPG) is the main force within the alliance.  Capturing this dam constitutes its second major victory after it recently routed ISIS out of several villages in Syria's northeastern Hasakeh province.  Turkey is against the YPG going west of the Euphrates and it doesn't want the group to dominate all of the Syrian frontier with Turkey.
