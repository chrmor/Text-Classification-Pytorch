Steve Jobs Yacht Freed From Impound After Unpaid Bill is Settled
Steve Jobs’ yacht, Venus, has been freed from its Amsterdam dock after his estate paid off the last of its bills.
Last week there was a report that the Venus had been impounded due to an unpaid bill of €3 million (approx. $3.95 million USD) to designer Philippe Starck. “The Venus is no longer impounded, we have found a solution,” Hague-based lawyer Gerard Moussault told AFP on Monday. “A security deposit was paid into a bank account, but I cannot say for how much.” The vessel is still currently in port, but Moussault explained that is only due to the captain waiting for better weather before he sets sail.
No word as of yet if the vessel will be heading all the way to California where the Jobs’ family still resides, but if so, it has a heck of a long journey ahead of it.
