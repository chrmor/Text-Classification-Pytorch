1 dead after explosion hits another chemical plant in Shandong
At least one person has been reported dead in yet another explosion that rocked a Chinese chemical factoryâ€”this time in Dongyin, Shandong province.
Residents reported hearing one loud explosion at the Lijin county plant at around 11:25 p.m. on Monday night, according to accounts on Weibo.
Local news websites confirmed that a blast went off at 11:22 p.m. and that the blaze was extinguished around five hours later.
No other details of the incident have been released.
The news comes weeks after a series of explosions at a warehouse storing hazardous materials in Tianjin left at least 158 people dead. The Binhai district blast gained international attention and raised questions about safety standards in the country.
On August 22, another explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Huantai county, Shandong province, killing one person and injuring nine others.
