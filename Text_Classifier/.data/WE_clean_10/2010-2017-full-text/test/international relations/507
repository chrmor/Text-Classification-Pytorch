Hundreds of Vietnamese protest China
HANOI – Hundreds gathered in Vietnam’s capital for a rare public protest demanding that China stay out of their waters following a spat involving a Vietnamese oil-drilling research boat in the South China Sea.
The group demonstrated Sunday in front of the Chinese Embassy, many carrying signs that read, “Stop Chinese invasion of Vietnam’s islands.” After about 30 minutes, they were dispersed by police. Public demonstrations are rarely allowed in the Communist-run country.
The protesters then marched toward central Hanoi’s landmark Hoan Kiem Lake, shouting anti-Chinese messages.
The protests follow a May 26 incident when a Chinese patrol boat allegedly destroyed the cable on a state-owned PetroVietnam boat conducting seismic research off Vietnam’s central coast.
