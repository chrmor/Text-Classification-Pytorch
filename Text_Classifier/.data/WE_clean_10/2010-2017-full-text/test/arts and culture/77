Actress Rossellini to lead Berlin jury
BERLIN, Aug. 30 (UPI) -- Actress Isabella Rossellini has been chosen to lead the Berlin International Film Festival jury in 2011, festival officials said.
Berlin festival director Dieter Kosslick called Rossellini "a multifaceted, creative film artist with extensive experience in European, American and international cinema," Variety reported Monday.
Rossellini, the daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian director Roberto Rossellini, began her career as a fashion designer and journalist, debuting on the big screen alongside her mother in Vincente Minnelli's "A Matter of Time." She gained international fame for performances in David Lynch's 1986 drama "Blue Velvet" and in Lynch's "Wild at Heart" in 1990.
She attended her first Berlin film festival in 1994 as the star of Peter Weir's film "Fearless" and has been a regular since.
Rossellini made her directorial debut in 2008 with "Green Porno," eight episodic shorts on the sexual behavior of earthworms, snails, dragonflies and other insects.
