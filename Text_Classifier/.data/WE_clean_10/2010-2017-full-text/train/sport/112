Scotsman Gary Anderson beats Phil 'The Power' Taylor 7-6 in final to win first darts World Championship title
Gary Anderson beat Phil 'The Power' Taylor 7-6 in a thrilling final to take the PDC world darts championship for the first time on Monday morning (AEDT) in London.
With the lively Alexandra Palace crowd on tenterhooks as the score see-sawed between the two, 16-times champion Taylor came back from 6-4 down to level 6-6 in a classic showdown with the 44-year-old 'Flying Scotsman'.
Anderson then took the first two legs of the deciding set before finishing the match with a double 12 to take the title.
Anderson's previous best performance in the tournament was in 2011 when he lost in the final to Adrian Lewis 7-5.
"There was a set where I played well and went 6-4 up and then after the break Phil took the next two sets and I felt it was gone," Anderson told Sky Sports after two and a half hours of throwing.
"He's the best and always will be, even in 100 years time. That makes this a wee bit more special," added the Scot, who beat Dutch reigning champion Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals.
