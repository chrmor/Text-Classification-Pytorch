China Sichuan governor suspected of corruption
The governor of China's Sichuan province, Wei Hong, is suspected of "severe disciplinary violations", according to a senior official.
"Discipline violations" is a term often used to refer to corruption.
Beijing's corruption crackdown has seen dozens of officials jailed in recent years, a drive criticised by some who see a political motive.
Earlier this week Chinese President Xi Jinping said the anti-corruption drive was proving an effective deterrent.
Wu Yuliang, deputy chief of the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, made the announcement about Wei Hong at a press conference on Friday.
Mr Wei has been governor of the populous south-western province for three years. Before that he was vice governor, since 2007, according to state media.
