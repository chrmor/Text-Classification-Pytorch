Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)
For the first time since Italy 1990, Diego Forlan is preparing to cheer Uruguay on at the FIFA World Cup™ as a supporter, a situation that will no doubt take some getting used to for a player who represented La Celeste at each of their world finals appearances since then.
Currently playing in Hong Kong, where he has been banging the goals in for Kitchee, the adidas Golden Ball winner at South Africa 2010 found some time in his busy schedule to discuss Russia 2018, Uruguay’s chances, the influence of Luis Suarez, his role as a fan and the contenders for the Trophy: “Brazil and Germany both have a great chance.”
