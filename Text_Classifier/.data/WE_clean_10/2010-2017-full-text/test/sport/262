2020 Candidate Cities deliver Candidature Files
Olympic Games Executive Director Gilbert Felli and Head of Bid City Relations Jacqueline Barrett received the files from the three delegations, which will now prepare for on-site inspections by the IOC Evaluation Commission, chaired by IOC Vice-President Sir Craig Reedie, in March.
After analysing the Candidature Files, the Commission will travel to Tokyo from 4 to 7 March, Madrid from 18 to 21 March and Istanbul from 24 to 27 March. It will then release a technical assessment of the Candidate Cities to coincide with the 2020 Candidate Briefing for IOC Members on 3 and 4 July 2013 in Lausanne. Each Candidate City will deliver a final 45-minute presentation to the 125th IOC Session ahead of the vote on 7 September 2013 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
