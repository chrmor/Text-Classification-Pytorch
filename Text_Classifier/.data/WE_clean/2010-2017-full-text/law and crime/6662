Trial for U.S. hikers held in Iran postponed â€“ This Just In
An official at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran says the trial of American citizens Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer has again been delayed.
"I have been able to verify that the session has actually been postponed due to the absence of the two prisoners. They were not brought in from prison," said a Swiss diplomat, who according to protocol, asked not to be identified.
"There were no reasons given why they were not brought in."
The Swiss Embassy represents U.S. interests in Iran. Fattal and Bauer were scheduled to appear on espionage charges at the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on Wednesday morning.
