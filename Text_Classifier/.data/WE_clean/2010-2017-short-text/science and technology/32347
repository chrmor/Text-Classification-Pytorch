While attempting to create a nanotechnology-based, catalyst-mediated series of chemical reactions to turn carbon dioxide (CO 2) (a greenhouse gas) into a usable fuel, scientists at the Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Laboratory instead discover a single-step process using the surface area of tiny spikes of copper and carbon as a catalyst to turn carbon dioxide into ethanol (CH 3CH 2OH). The reaction may serve as a method to alleviate possible climate change by both decreasing CO 2 in the atmosphere and by using the ethanol as an additive to fuels to increase efficiency and thereby decrease consumption.
