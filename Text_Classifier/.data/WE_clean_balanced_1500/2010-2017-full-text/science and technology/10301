Join Slooh Astronomer Paul Cox and Slooh's Storyteller Helen Avery on Tuesday, May 29th at 7:00 PM EDT (23:00UTC) to learn about and celebrate the "Full Flower Moon". Slooh will have live views of moonrise over the Andes from Slooh's southern hemisphere observatory in Chile, alongside stunning live streams of the Full Moon using the telescopes at Slooh's flagship observatory at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands.
Paul Cox will be going back-to-basics to explain how our Moon formed, what causes lunar phases, as well as an unusual phenomenon where the Moon appears to "rock and roll"! He'll also be introducing the "How Many Moons in One Night?" challenge - where Slooh members see how many of our solar system's moons they can capture in a single night using Slooh's high powered robotic telescopes.
Slooh's Storyteller Helen Avery will be telling us about why this particular Full Moon is named the "Full Flower Moon", as well as some of the other names used by different cultures down the ages. Helen will also delve into a little moon lore and legend while viewers can switch between the different live telescope feeds during the livecast.
