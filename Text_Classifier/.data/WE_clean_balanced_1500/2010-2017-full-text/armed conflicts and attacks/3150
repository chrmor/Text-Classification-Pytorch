Reports: CIA bomber was al-Qaeda double agent
The suicide bomber who killed eight people inside a CIA base in Afghanistan last week was a 36-year-old Jordanian doctor who was a double agent for al-Qaeda, NBC News is reporting.
The Associated Press says that its sources confirmed the report.
The bomber was identified as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, who had moderated the main al-Qaeda chat forum before being arrested last year by Jordanian intelligence agents. He was from Zarqa, the hometown of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who led al-Qaeda in Iraq and conducted hundreds of attacks and killings before being killed in a U.S. air attack in 2006.
Initial reports said the attack on the CIA base in Khost was carried out by a member of the Afghan National Army. The blast killed four CIA officers, three contracted security guards and a senior Jordanian intelligence officer, who was al-Balawi's handler and a member of the royal family.
NBC says the Jordanians believed al-Balawi had been successfully reformed, and he was recruited to infiltrate al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Officials said his mission was to find and meet Osama bin Laden's right-hand man â€” Ayman al-Zawahiri, also a doctor.
But, according to a Taliban spokesman quoted on the Al-Jazeera website, al-Balawi misled Jordanian and U.S. intelligence services. The spokesman said he would release a video confirming his account of the Afghanistan attack.
