Gould Wins Championship League
Martin Gould made a century in the deciding frame to beat Ali Carter 3-2 in the final of the Championship League.
Gould, the world number 21 from London, took the top prize of £10,000 at Crondon Park in Essex as well as £200 per frame in the group section of the winners’ group plus £300 per frame in the play offs. Added to his winnings from groups one, two, three and four and it totted up to a tasty £31,117 pay day.
“I’ve won Power Snooker, a PTC event, the Shoot-Out and now this so I need to do it in a ranking event,” said Gould. “I’ve put in more practice recently and Stephen Feeney at SightRight has been sorting me out and the hard work is beginning to pay off.”
Carter led 2-1 in the final but Gould levelled with a run of 68 then claimed victory thanks to a 100 in the last frame.
“With the winning break, I could have dropped the blue in and played safe but I took the brown on, got on a red and was able to clear up. Now I’ve got three weeks off which is unheard of for a snooker player nowadays but I’m looking forward to the World Championship,” he added.
The Championship League Snooker event is a venture between Matchroom Sport and Perform where 25 of the game’s finest players compete with all matches broadcast on a host of betting websites.
Each of the seven groups featured seven players with each man playing the other six once in a round-robin basis. At the end of the league phase the top four advanced to that group’s semi-finals where the two winners meet in the final.
For beaten finalist Carter, there was a cheque for £20,800 to console himself with. Other notable money winners included Stephen Maguire who banked £24,600 without even reaching the winners’ group and Marco Fu, who accumulated £14,900.
