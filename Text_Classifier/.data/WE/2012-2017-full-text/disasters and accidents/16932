Flood warnings for drenched northwest Qld
Flood warnings are in place and roads have been closed as heavy rain continues to fall over drenched parts of northwest Queensland.
The Bureau of Meteorology says more than 100mm of rain was recorded over parts of the Gulf Country in the 24 hours until 9am (AEST) on Sunday, with thunderstorms expected to dump another 30-100mm on Sunday and Monday.
Forecasters are closely monitoring a monsoon trough in the area over concerns it could strengthen into a monsoonal low or possibly a tropical cyclone later next week.
Heavy falls have been recorded in the Gulf Country, extending across the northwest and far northern coastal areas and more is expected over the coming days.
About 147mm was recorded in Cairns and 98mm at Landsborough Highway, near Mt Isa, in the 24 hours until Sunday morning.
About 110mm fell over Normanton, just 5mm less than the March average.
Forecaster Chris Joseph said while the monsoon trough was "pretty active" and there was a possibility it could strengthen into a monsoonal low, the chance of it forming into a cyclone was slim.
Flood warnings were issued for the Georgina, Eyre, Western, Diamantina, Cloncurry and Cooper rivers on Sunday, with the bureau warning heavy rain could cause localised flooding.
Acting Senior Sergeant Shaune English said officers had been called out to search for several vehicles cut off due to floodwaters, however no injuries had been reported.
He urged drivers to check road and weather conditions before setting out as several roads have been closed in the northwest.
Heavy rain was also recorded on the Gold Coast over the weekend.
