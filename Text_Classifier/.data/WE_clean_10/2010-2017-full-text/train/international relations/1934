Iran swaps enriched uranium for Russia’s yellowcake
Head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Ali Akbar Salehi referred to the completion of uranium and yellowcake exchange process between Iran and Russia adding “on the basis of JCPOA, Iran was committed to decide upon its uranium in excess of the specified amount before the implementation date.”
Salehi pointed out the existence of three possibilities in this regard adding “one way was to convert uranium into fuel assemblies which would be time-consuming requiring two or three years.”
“The second solution was to dilute the excess uranium which sounds unreasonable to return the enriched product back to its normal condition after exercising a great deal of effort,” he continued.
Salehi went on to underline that “the third and the most reasonable possibility was to sell the enriched material in order to earn back all the costs of uranium enrichment and conversion as well as the costs of raw materials.”
“Additionally, we have managed to enter the enriched materials market as a developing country,” he stressed.
Salehi further emphasized that the fuel swap with Russia has been accomplished; “we have dispatched about 11 tons of surplus enriched uranium to Russia and received around 200 tons of natural uranium (yellowcake) in turn.”
Referring to the latest status of Arak heavy water reactor, the official said “the redesigning of Arak reactor has begun since last year and is still underway while the conceptual design stage has been carried through."
“All the measures providing a guarantee for the cooperation of the other party are being undertaken and future actions will be performed accordingly,” Salehi concluded.
