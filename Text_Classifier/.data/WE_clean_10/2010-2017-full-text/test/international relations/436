Brazil recognizes Palestinian state -  Haaretz - Israel News
Brazil says it has recognized the state of Palestine based on borders at the time of Israel's 1967 conquest of the West Bank.
The Foreign Ministry says the recognition is in response to a request made by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas last month to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Silva sent a letter to Abbas on December 1, saying Brazil recognizes Palestine and hopes that the recognition will help lead to states of Israel and Palestine "that will coexist peacefully and in security."
The Brazilian foreign ministry says that the recognition is "in line with Brazil's historic willingness to contribute to peace between Israel and Palestine."
The announcement was posted Friday on the Foreign Ministry's website.
