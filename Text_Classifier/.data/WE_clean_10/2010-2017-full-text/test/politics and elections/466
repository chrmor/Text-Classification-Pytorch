Ouagadougou (AFP) - Burkina Faso's presidential and parliamentary elections, delayed because of a failed coup, will now take place on November 29, two candidates said Tuesday after a meeting with the country's interim authorities.
"The date of November 29 has been set by all Burkina Faso's political players for the organisation of legislative and presidential elections," Ablasse Ouedraogo said.
Fellow presidential candidate Roch Marc Christian Kabore, confirmed the date which is to be approved at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
The polls, seen as a major step in the impoverished west African country's road to democracy, were originally scheduled for October 11 but had to be put back after a short-lived putsch by elite troops loyal to deposed leader Blaise Compaore.
The presidential guard (RSP) announced a coup in the restive west African country on September 17, bringing the country to the edge of chaos for six days before the bid collapsed with its leaders admitting they did not enjoy popular support.
The RSP disarmed and was formally disbanded at a ceremony in the capital Ouagadougou earlier this month.
Compaore was ousted in a popular uprising last year after 27 years in power. A number of close aides and supporters have been arrested over the attempted coup.
Last week President Michel Kafando led up to 3,000 people in a memorial service to remember victims of the would-be coup which left 14 dead and 251 injured.
