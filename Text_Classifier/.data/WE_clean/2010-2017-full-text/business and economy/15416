Shorter Sentence Possible for Ex-Enron CEO
After more than six years behind bars, former Enron Corp. chief executive Jeffrey Skilling may be closer than ever to exiting a Colorado federal prison earlier than expected.
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a notice to former Enron employees, shareholders and other victims saying it was considering entering into an agreement with Mr. Skilling, who is waiting for a court-ordered resentencing, "to resolve certain disputed matters concerning sentencing." It didn't specify those issues.
