Bodies of 40 migrants wash ashore in Libya
The bodies of 40 migrants have been found washed ashore in Libya.
Red Crescent spokesman Mohamed al-Masrati said 27 of the bodies were found on Saturday at the town of Zliten, east of the capital, Tripoli.
The rest were found along the shores of Tripoli and the nearby town of Khoms.
Most of the migrants were from sub-Saharan African countries and a search was underway for another 30 migrants who were believed to have been on the boat that capsized.
Thousands of migrants seeking a better life in Europe have cast off from Libya on rickety boats. The country slid into chaos following the 2011 toppling and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
Smugglers have exploited Libya's turmoil, sending off thousands of desperate migrants from the country's shores.
