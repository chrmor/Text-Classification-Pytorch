Bahrain police disperse demonstrators with tear gas: Witness
Bahraini police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Shia Muslim anti-government protesters on Wednesday, but there were no reports of casualties.
A Reuters correspondent saw police dispersing the demonstrators, who had approached a barbed wire fence erected the night before on the outskirts of the village of Shakhoora, west of the capital Manama, following calls by activists for mass anti-government protests.
