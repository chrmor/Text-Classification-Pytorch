Greek strikers turn out in thousands
Thousands of protesters have turned out on the streets of Athens in the third general strike this year, as Greek ministers prepare to debate new austerity measures. Parliament square is awash with Greek and Spanish flags, as well as banners reading "Resist" and the battle cry from the Spanish civil war, "No pasaran" (they shall not pass), AFP reported.
