Four Are Charged in Tanzania Ferry Sinking
STONE TOWN, Tanzania (AP) — Tanzanian authorities have charged four men with negligence over a ferry sinking Sept. 10 that cost more than 240 lives.
It is unclear how many passengers were aboard, but more than 800 people survived by clinging to pieces of wood or crowding onto lifeboats.
“It is a relief to us to hear that a handful of people were charged, but we believe the real culprits remain untouched,” said one survivor, Suleiman Malik. “We wish to see some big fish fished out and face the long arms of the law.”
The ferry’s owner, Yusuf Suleiman Jussa, 47, its first officer, Abdallah Mohamed Ali, 30, and a Zanzibar Ports Authority employee, Silima Nyange Silima, 27, were charged with contravening the Maritime Act by allowing the heavily overloaded ferry, the M.V. Spice Islander, to leave port.
The captain, Said Abdullah Kinyanyite, who remains missing, was charged in absentia.
Ramadhan Nassib from the Directorate of Public Prosecution said the four were responsible for the deaths after the ferry sank in the early hours of Sept. 10 in an area of deep seas and strong currents.
The suspects were not allowed to enter a plea after the charges were read out to a packed courtroom late on Friday.
