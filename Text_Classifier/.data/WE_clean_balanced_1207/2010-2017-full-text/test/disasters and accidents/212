Four coalminers trapped in south Wales
British rescue workers are pumping water from a flooded coalmine in South Wales in an attempt to reach four trapped miners.
Rescuers say they have not been able to contact the men, trapped 90 metres underground at the Gleision Colliery near Swansea, and it is not immediately clear what condition they are in nor what caused the mine to flood.
"Unfortunately we have had no communication with the miners," Mines Rescue Service official Mark Tibbott said.
"You do get air pockets and hopefully the men are in an air pocket," he told Sky News.
