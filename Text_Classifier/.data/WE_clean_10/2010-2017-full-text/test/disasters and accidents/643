Tsunami warning cancelled after magnitude 7.4 earthquake strikes off Papua New Guinea
A tsunami warning has been cancelled for coastlines near the epicentre of a magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck off Papua New Guinea.
The US Geological Survey issued an alert saying the quake struck 13km south of Kokopo at approximately 11.44am AEST, in the New Britain region of the island nation, at a depth of 50km.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had said that hazardous tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1m were possible for Papua New Guinea coastlines located within 300km of the earthquake epicentre.
While some tsunami oscillations were reported in Rabaul Harbour, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has now declared that the threat of a tsunami has largely passed. 
Preliminary reports said the quake was a magnitude 7.5 at a depth of 10km, but that information has since been updated.
According to data from the USGS, there have been several recent earthquakes in the area.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake was recorded on the 29 of March, 53km to the south-east of Kokopo.
A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck to the south-west of Kokopo on the 30 of April this year, quickly followed by a 6.8 magnitude earthquake the following day.
