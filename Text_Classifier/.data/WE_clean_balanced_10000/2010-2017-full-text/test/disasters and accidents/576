Puerto Rico rocked by 6.5-magnitude earthquake
A strong quake of magnitude 6.5 struck north off Puerto Rico on Monday and could trigger a local tsunami, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
It said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 6.4, was very shallow, at a depth of 27 kilometres below the seabed. It struck at 11:01 p.m. ET, 56 kilometres north of the town of Hatillo.
"There is the small possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a hundred kilometers from the earthquake epicenter," the tsunami center said in its advisory.
There were no immediate reports of damage.
