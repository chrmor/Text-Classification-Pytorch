Oscars 2015: Best Actress Julianne Moore Wins Award
Julianne Moore took home the Academy Award for best actress on Sunday night for her leading role in Still Alice.
Matthew McConaughey presented the award to Moore, who beat out Felicity Jones, Marion Cotillard, Reese Witherspoon and Rosamund Pike to take home the Oscar.

"I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer," the actress said as she began her acceptance speech. "If that’s true, I’d really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me!” 
At last year's awards show, Cate Blanchett took home the honor for her work in Blue Jasmine. 
Neil Patrick Harris is hosting the 87th annual Academy Awards, which is being broadcast live on ABC from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
