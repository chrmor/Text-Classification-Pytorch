Twin blasts during a funeral killed 12 people and injured 48 in a predominantly Christian suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus on Tuesday, Syria’s state TV said.
The explosions occurred in the Jaramana neighborhood when a funeral procession for two victims of Monday’s car bomb blasts in the same district approached a local cemetery.
Earlier reports put the death toll at about 20.
The Syrian conflict has claimed up to 20,000 lives, according to estimates by various Syrian opposition groups. The West is pushing for President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster, while Russia and China are trying to prevent outside interference in Syria, saying the Assad regime and the opposition are both to blame for the bloodshed.
