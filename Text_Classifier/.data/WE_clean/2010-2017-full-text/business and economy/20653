Target Shares Roadmap to Transform Business
At a meeting today for the investor community, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell and members of his leadership team presented the vision and strategies that will transform the retailer’s business.
“Following a thorough, strategic review of our business, coupled with a careful evaluation of the changing retail landscape, we have identified the key initiatives that will put Target on a clear path to growth,” said Cornell. “We’re focused on our future and building the capabilities that will take us further, faster. Redefining Target will require a renewed emphasis on prioritization and innovation, and above all else, putting our guests first in everything we do.”
The retailer’s differentiation in the marketplace will be driven by stronger merchandising authority and a shopping experience that is centered on ease and inspiration, with mobile serving as the front door to all of Target. The retailer also will reassert its cultural leadership to build unparalleled guest affinity. In addition, Target will create a headquarters team that is more agile, efficient and guest-focused. Target’s transformation roadmap includes the following areas of focus:
Cost savings of $2 billion over the next two years will fuel Target’s growth and drive profitability. These savings will be realized through operations, technology and process improvements; supply chain and sourcing efficiencies; and corporate restructuring. The restructuring will be concentrated at Target’s headquarters locations and focus on driving leaner, more efficient capabilities, removing complexity and allowing the organization to move with greater speed and agility. This includes the establishment of centralized teams based on specialized expertise and the elimination of several thousand positions over the next two years. This year, Target expects to invest between $2 and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures, including a $1 billion investment in technology and supply chain.
“While we’re in the early days and there’s no doubt that transformation can be challenging, we’re taking the steps necessary to unleash the potential of this incredible brand,” said Cornell. “I’m encouraged by our early momentum, and am confident that by implementing our strategy, simplifying how we work, and practicing financial discipline, we will ignite Target’s innovative spirit and deliver sustained growth.”
