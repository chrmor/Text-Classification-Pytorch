Somalia seizes planes carrying pirate ransoms-officials
MOGADISHU, May 24 (Reuters) - Somali authorities seized two aircraft carrying $3.6 million in ransom payments for pirates on Tuesday and detained six foreigners, government officials said.
Somali pirate gangs are reaping tens of millions of dollars in ransoms by seizing ships and holding their cargos and crew hostage.
International navies have managed to quell attacks in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping lane, but have struggled to contain the pirates in the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean.
Cash ransoms are usually dropped onto captured vessels from light aircraft.
“This morning, two unmarked planes landed and exchanged cargo. After investigation, $3.6 million were found,” Abdi Sheikhur Sheikh Hassan, Somalia’s interior and security minister said in a statement.
An official at Mogadishu airport said one of the planes had flown in from the Kenyan capital Nairobi, while they were yet to determine the origin of the second.
“We seized the two planes and their pilots plus the ransom for the pirates,” airport deputy security chief Burhan Mohamed told Reuters.
“We have taken the men and their cash to the jail. One plane was from Nairobi and it wanted to give the money to the pirates using another plane that landed soon after,” he said.
It was not immediately clear which hijacked vessel was involved in the ransom payment. (Reporting by Abdi Sheikh; Editing by George Obulutsa and Michel Rose)
