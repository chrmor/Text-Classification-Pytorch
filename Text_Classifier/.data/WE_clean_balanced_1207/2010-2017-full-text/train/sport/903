Live-Blogging Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals
The Cup is coming back to Boston.
With opportune scoring and record-setting goaltending, the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup with a 4-0 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7.
Patrice Bergeron scored two goals and Brad Marchand added two more for Boston, which was outshot, 37-21. But Tim Thomas, who stopped more shots this postseason than any goalie in history, turned away every one he saw.
To no one’s surprise, Thomas was awarded the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player. He is the second American to win the award, after Brian Leetch in 1994.
It is Boston’s first Stanley Cup since 1972, when the Bruins legends Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito roamed the old Boston Garden. Now Bergeron, Marchand, Zdeno Chara and Thomas will take their place among those legends.
