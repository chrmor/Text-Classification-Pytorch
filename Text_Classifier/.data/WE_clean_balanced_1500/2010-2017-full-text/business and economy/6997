Independent introduces its succinct spin-off – the tabloid 'i'
Almost 25 years after the launch of the Independent, the newspaper is tomorrow publishing a spin-off title, entitled i and designed to attract younger readers.
The 56-page tabloid will be distributed nationally and promoted with the catchy, if illiterate, marketing slogan: "'i' is, are you?", a nod to one of its parent paper's advertising campaigns.
The Independent's owner, the Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev, hopes i – a slimmed-down, faster-paced version of the main paper – will appeal to readers who might have swapped newspapers for the web. It is the first national daily to launch since the Independent in 1986.
Newspaper Publishing executives said the 20p version would complement the Indy. Media buyers were told i should have a circulation of 250,00-280,000 copies though 400,000 will be published tomorrow.
Andrew Power, of the agency Starcom, said the "smart move" would test whether there was a market for a succinct, quality title.
The Independent sold 182,776 copies daily on average in September, down by 1.99% year-on-year, but foreign sales and more than 95,000 free or discounted copies are included in that figure.
