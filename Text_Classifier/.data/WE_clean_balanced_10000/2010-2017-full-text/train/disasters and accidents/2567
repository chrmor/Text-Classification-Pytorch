Nick Clegg visits Pakistan flood relief camp in Sukkur
Nick Clegg has said Pakistan will need aid for years to come following the worst floods in decades, after seeing the devastation there himself.
During a visit to a relief camp in Sukkur, the deputy prime minister said the international community "didn't react with sufficient speed" to what was "a slow-moving, relentless, disaster".
Mr Clegg met children in a makeshift school at a camp which houses more than 3,000 displaced people.
