Pop singer Bruno Mars pleads guilty to cocaine charge
Pop star Bruno Mars pleaded guilty Wednesday to felony possession of cocaine in a Las Vegas courtroom as part of a plea deal.
Mars, 25, whose real name is Peter Hernandez, made the plea before Clark County District Court Judge Jessie Walsh.
As part of the deal, Mars was ordered to be on probation for a year, pay a $2,000 fine, take drug counseling and perform 200 hours of community service.
If he completes the requirements and stays out of trouble for a year, he will be able to withdraw his plea and the case against him will be dismissed.
In his brief court appearance Wednesday, Mars answered the judgeâ€™s questions in a quiet voice and avoided looking at cameras.
His attorneys asked that he be allowed to perform the drug counseling online rather than have to come from his home in California to take a class in Las Vegas. Prosecutors said he could take the counseling from a private company in California, and the judge agreed.
Mars spent a night in the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas following his arrest in a Hard Rock Hotel restroom early Sept. 19 after a nightclub performance there.
Police said Mars handed over a bag containing 2.6 grams of cocaine, and told the arresting officer he'd never used drugs before.
