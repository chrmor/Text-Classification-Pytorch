Russian disaster was no defeat, Napoleon argued
It went down in history as a military disaster which fatally weakened Napoleon's grip on Europe - but a manuscript auctioned in France overnight reveals the then-emperor argued his 1812 invasion of Russia was actually a victory.
Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e entered Moscow on September 14, 1812, but much of the population had already fled and the emperor was forced to leave without securing a formal victory.
The army was forced to retreat in the depths of winter, leaving hundreds of thousands of men dead or dying by the roadside.
On Sunday a manuscript describing the campaign, and dictated by Napoleon during his exile on the British island of Saint Helena, set a record of 375,000 euros ($467,700) when it was auctioned near Paris.
In the 300-page "Essay on Campaign Fortification", the fallen emperor mulls over the outcome of the Russian invasion.
"It should not be called a retreat since the army was victorious," he says of the campaign.
The manuscript was given for sale by the descendents of Napoleon's general, Henri Gatien Bertrand, who had accompanied him to Saint Helena.
"It's a world record for a manuscript of Napoleon," the Osenat auction house said.
A 200-year-old letter in which Napoleon vows to blow up the Kremlin fetched 187,500 euros ($233,800) at the same auction, in Fontainebleau, south-east of Paris.
The coded missive, written in numbers and signed "Nap", said: "I will blow up the Kremlin on the 22nd at three in the morning."
Dated October 20, 1812, the day after Napoleon retreated from the centre of Moscow, it was addressed to his external relations minister Hugues-Bernard Maret.
It had been expected to fetch between 10,000 and 15,000 euros at the sale
Napoleon's order was executed and several towers and sections of wall at the Kremlin, at the time both an imperial palace and military fortress, were destroyed. The towers were later rebuilt identically.
