BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) â€” A powerful but deep earthquake shook a broad swath of Colombia and Ecuador on Saturday, sending frightened people fleeing into the streets, but there were no immediate reports of significant damage or deaths.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the 9:16 a.m. (14:16 GMT) quake had a magnitude of 7.0.It was centered about 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the Colombian town of Pasto and 77 miles (129 kilometers) below the surface.
The quake was felt in the Colombian capital of Bogota, some 340 miles (545 kilometers) to the northeast, and across much of neighboring Ecuador.
Colombia's national disaster chief, Carlos Ivan Marquez, said officials had made a damage survey across the country "and fortunately up to this moment we have no reports of human losses."
In the province of Narino, where the quake hit, secretary of government Jaime Rodriguez said officials had reports of three people hurt when roof tiles fell in the town of El Charco along the Pacific Coast. Officials in Ecuador also reported no significant damage.
Colombian television showed people fleeing into the streets in southwestern cities such as Cali, and small cracks in the walls of some buildings.
