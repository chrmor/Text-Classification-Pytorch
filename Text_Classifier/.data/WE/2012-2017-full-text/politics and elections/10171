Taiwanese activist deported from Hong Kong after entry denied
Hong Kong, June 29 (CNA) A student leader of the Sunflower Movement that occupied Taiwan's Legislature for more than three weeks was deported to Taiwan on Sunday after Hong Kong customs authorities denied him entry into the former British colony. It was not immediately clear why Chen Wei-ting was not allowed to enter Hong Kong and later sent home. But Chen apparently did not have a visa for Hong Kong, required of Taiwanese nationals visiting the territory, after his application for an e-visa to Hong Kong made a few days ago was denied. The student activist was expected back in Taiwan later in the day. Chen flew to Hong Kong at around noon Sunday intending to support the Occupy Central campaign that is pushing for the full implementation of universal suffrage there.
