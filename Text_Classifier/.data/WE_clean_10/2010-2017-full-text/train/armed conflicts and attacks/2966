Pathankot terror attack: Operation continues for second day; PM Modi chairs high-level meeting
Explosions and firing continued intermittently on Sunday night as security forces killed one of the at least two terrorists holed up at Pathankot air base on the second day of the attack in which military casualties including a Lieutenant Colonel of the NSG mounted to seven.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting on SUndayÂ night with top officials including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar in Delhi even as questions were raised by defence experts over the way the encounter with heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists was handled by security agencies.
Defence sources in Delhi said tonight that one terrorist was killed today while another was injured in the encounter that was on for nearly 43 hours, a day after four terrorists were eliminated after they struck on Saturday.
