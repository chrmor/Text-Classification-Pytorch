DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) â€” Syrian state media say a car bomb has struck in a Damascus suburb, killing at least 18 people and wounding 56.
The news agency SANA says the powerful blast hit the Syrian capital's suburb of Jaramana late on Tuesday.
The suburb is an overwhelmingly pro-regime district located just a few kilometers (miles) southeast of Damascus.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar Assad from power have frequently targeted areas where regime supporters and members of the government or security forces live.
