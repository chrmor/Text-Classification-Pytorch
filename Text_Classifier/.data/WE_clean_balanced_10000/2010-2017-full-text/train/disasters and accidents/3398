Many killed in Morocco rains
At least 30 people have been killed in Morroco following torrential rain and floods.
The dead included 24 people who were killed on Tuesday after their bus fell into a flooded river near Bouznika city, 40km south of the capital Rabat, police and the official MAP news agency said.
The passengers were factory workers travelling from Bouznika to the Atlantic coast city of Casablanca after their night shift.
"The bus fell into a ravine because of the heavy rain," a police officer told the AFP news agency.
A young girl drowned after being swept away while trying to cross a bridge in Tiflet, east of Rabat.
Four members of a family also died late on Monday when heavy rainfalls brought down their home near the central city of Khenifra, MAP said.
One man also drowned in the north of the country and seven other people were swept away by a river, the news agency said.
The rain also disrupted flights from Casablanca airport and hampered communication systems at banks.
ATMs were affected, causing long queues of customers attempting to withdraw cash.
"The lines are down because of the rain. We can't process any operation for the moment," said an Attijariwafa Bank employee.
Schools were also closed on Tuesday in Casablanca due to the heavy rainfall.
