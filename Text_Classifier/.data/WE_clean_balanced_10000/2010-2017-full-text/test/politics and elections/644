Ivory Coast: Opponent Calls for Protests
A spokesman for the party of Alassane Ouattara called on Tuesday for mass protest marches this week to seize the state broadcaster and government buildings, raising the stakes in an election struggle with the incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo. Mr. Gbagbo has refused to step down despite election commission results showing he lost to Mr. Ouattara, a tally certified by the local United Nations mission. The call for protests was the first time that Mr. Ouattaraâ€™s camp has called supporters en masse onto the streets since he claimed victory and swore himself in as president.
