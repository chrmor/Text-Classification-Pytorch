  Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” won the trophy for song of the year at the 54th Grammy Awards on Sunday night. It’s another boost in what is widely considered to be a cleanup year for her at the Grammys after she garnered six total nominations, including the top categories of record of the year and album of the year.
The last few months have been a nonstop roller coaster for the 23-year-old British songstress, who returned to the Grammy stage to perform after being sidelined since early October with vocal cord trauma that required surgery. But despite her health problems, Adele’s overwhelming nominations are well-earned.
Her sophomore effort “21” was the top-selling album of 2011, moving a total of 5.82 million copies during the year, with “Rolling in the Deep” becoming the album’s bestselling single with 5.81 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan’s year-end data.
Looking at overwhelming similarities in the nominees for song of the year and record of the year (the one variable being Katy Perry’s “Firework”), it seemed as if the Recording Academy put all its adoration into only six songs that dominated radio in 2011.
Recording Academy voters have had a history of appreciation for big commercial pop hits (e.g. Beyoncé’s win for “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” in 2010). Last year offered a bit of a shake-up when Nashville darlings Lady Antebellum walked away with the Grammy for “Need You Now,” besting last year’s perceived shoo-in, Eminem and Rihanna’s “Love the Way You Lie.”   
The Grammys are determined by about 13,000 voting members. The eligibility period for nominated recordings was Oct. 1, 2010, to Sept. 30, 2011.
The 2011 awards are being held at the Staples Center and telecast on CBS. They are broadcast live except for viewers on the West Coast. The latest headlines and any breaking news will be posted here on Pop & Hiss.
