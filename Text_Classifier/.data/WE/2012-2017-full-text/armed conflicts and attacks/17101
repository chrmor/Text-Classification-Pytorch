Syrian Army Said to Be Closer to Retaking Palmyra
BEIRUT, Lebanon — After days of raging battles with Islamic State militants, Syrian Army units and allied government militias backed by intensive Russian airstrikes on Friday recaptured the strategically important citadel in Palmyra, Syrian state television reported, citing a military source.
“The army has been edging closer to Palmyra as its units continue fighting ISIS terrorists in the vicinity of the ancient city establishing control over Palmyra Castle after inflicting heavy losses on ISIS terrorists,” said the state news agency, SANA.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, confirmed the reports, noting that the government forces had reached the ancient castle with the help of Russian special forces and Al Fatimi’yen, a brigade made up of Afghans who were living in Iran.
Some opposition activists were dubious of the reports from government-dominated news media. “Nothing proves they took the castle yet,” said Khaled al-Homsi, a Palmyra native who is an anti-government activist related to an archaeology expert and former official who was killed by the Islamic State when it overran the city.
He added that if the reports proved to be true, then the government almost certainly will have retaken the city. “If the regime forces reached the citadel, which overlooks the whole city, that means that Palmyra is under the regime’s control.”
Another activist, Bebars al-Talawy, who communicates with contacts in the Islamic State’s media offices via Skype, said that “ISIS forces now are pulling out all their equipment from the city and planting land mines everywhere.”
A government soldier reached in Palmyra sent a text message from the battlefield saying, “We recaptured the citadel two days ago but delayed the announcement until we dismantle the land mines.”
