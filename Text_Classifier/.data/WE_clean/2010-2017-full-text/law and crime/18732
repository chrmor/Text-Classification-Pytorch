Altered N.F.L. Settlement Wins Judge’s Approval
A federal judge approved a preliminary settlement between the N.F.L. and lawyers for the more than 4,500 retired players who sued the league, accusing it of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated hits to the head.
The judge’s consent, which was widely expected, means that the more than 20,000 retired players and their beneficiaries can now vote on the deal, which includes a promise from the N.F.L. to pay an unlimited amount of awards to players with certain severe neurological conditions.
Legal experts expect it will be approved because the new settlement addressed the main concern that Judge Anita B. Brody of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania had with the original plan.
That deal included $765 million for cash awards, medical testing and education. Brody, though, rejected it in January because, like some retired players, she was concerned that there would not be enough money to cover the 65-year life of the settlement.
