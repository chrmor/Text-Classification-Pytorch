Train derails in India killing about 20 people and injuring scores more
A train has come off the tracks in northern India killing about 20 people and injuring scores more, as carriages slammed into each other.
Rescuers and local people worked into the night searching for survivors in the overturned and mangled carriages, some piled on top of each other.
The death toll in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh was expected to rise, officials said.
At least eight carriages derailed in the crash close to Muzaffarnagar, about 130 kilometres north of the capital New Delhi, as the train travelled towards the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, police said.
Train crashes are frequent in India, which has the world's fourth-largest rail network.
Poor investment in past decades in the vast network and rising demand means overcrowded trains are running on creaking infrastructure.
Saturday's accident is at least the fourth major passenger train derailment this year and the third in Uttar Pradesh in 2017.
A senior police officer in the state, Anand Kumar, said close to 20 people had been killed and more than 80 injured.
The national authorities sent disaster teams to help.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a message on Twitter saying he was pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express, offering condolences to families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.
