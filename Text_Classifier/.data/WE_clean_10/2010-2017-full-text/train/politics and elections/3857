Chinese become less satisfied
Chinese people have become less satisfied with their lives, according to the Blue Book of China's Society 2010 issued by Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) Wednesday, Xinhua News Agency reported.
The blue book says Chinese urban and rural residents' life satisfaction indices have decreased. The satisfaction index for residents in small towns has dropped the most- from 3.59 last year to 3.37, while the index for rural residents has dropped from 3.55 to 3.42.
The book indicates Chinese people are much less tolerant towards price fluctuations than they were in 2006, 2007 and 2009. The rural consumer confidence index has dropped to its lowest point since 2006.
It also shows in 2010, urban residents were more concerned about their life after retirement; meanwhile, rural residents are less optimistic that their income will increase or their living condition will improve.
According to the book, for the past three years, personal financial situations have been the most influential factor in determining how urban Chinese feel about their lives. For rural Chinese, employment status became the top influence this year.
