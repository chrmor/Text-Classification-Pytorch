Floods kill at least 13 people in central Vietnam
HANOI (Reuters) - Floods brought by torrential rain since late November have killed at least 13 people in central Vietnam while more heavy rain is expected in coming days, the government and state media said on Sunday.
Six people have died in floods in Binh Dinh province since Thursday and another four were killed in Quang Ngai province, while more than 10,000 homes in the two provinces were submerged, the government said.
Three children aged between four and 13 were swept away in flood waters in Quang Nam province on Saturday, the Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper cited a provincial report as saying.
A cold snap now moving southward is forecast to bring heavy rain to central provinces between now and next Thursday, the government report said.
Floods killed 65 people since October in central provinces, submerged 200,000 homes and damaged railway and roads, with losses valued at more than 7 trillion dong ($309 million), the government said on Friday.
The flood-stricken areas are in the north, outside Vietnamâ€™s Central Highlands coffee belt and Mekong Delta food basket.
