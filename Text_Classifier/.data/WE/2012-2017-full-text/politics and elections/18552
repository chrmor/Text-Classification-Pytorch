George Will leaves the GOP
Conservative columnist George Will has left the Republican Party.
The longtime commentator reportedly made the announcement during a Federalist Society event in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
Will, who resides in Maryland, said he changed his affiliation this month from Republican to unaffiliated.
A report from PJ Media quoted Will as saying: “This is not my party.”
He also said that it’s too late for the Republican Party to nominate someone who isn’t Donald Trump, an idea that those in the Never Trump movement have been holding on to as the convention nears.
“Make sure he loses,” he said. “Grit their teeth for four years and win the White House.”
Trump attacked the Washington Post columnist as a “major loser” last month, criticizing a column Will wrote, headlined “If Trump is nominated, the GOP must keep him out of the White House.”
