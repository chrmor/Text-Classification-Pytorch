British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon says only five percent of Russia's airstrikes in Syria have targeted Islamic State extremists. Instead, other Syrian rebel groups, including the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, have been attacked. "Our evidence indicates they are dropping unguided munitions in civilian areas, killing civilians," Fallon added. (Voice of America), (Reuters)The United States military reports a drone attack killed ISIL rocket expert Jasim Khadijah. The unmanned airstrike also killed other IS militants and destroyed at least one makeshift drone. Khadijah, a former Iraqi officer, is believed responsible for the March attack that killed a U.S. Marine in northern Iraq. (UPI) (Daily Mail)
