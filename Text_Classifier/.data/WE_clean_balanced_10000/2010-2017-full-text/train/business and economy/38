Protests rock Bangladesh as shares plunge
Hundreds of investors went on the rampage in the commercial heart of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka after the stock exchange suffered its steepest ever fall.
The benchmark DSE general index (DGEN) lost 552 points or 6.72 per cent by the close of trade on Sunday as panic gripped investors following last week's policy rate hike by the central bank and a series of recent volatile market swings.
Local police chief Tofazzal Hossain said at least 500 investors hurled bricks at law enforcement officers near the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offices.
"They chanted slogans against the government and the regulators, and marched through the busy roads in the Motijheel Commercial area, halting traffic. They also staged a sit-in at the SEC building," he said.
The plunge pulled the DGEN down to 7,654.40.
The index hit a record high on December 5 of 8,918.51 points, up around 80 per cent since the start of the year.
