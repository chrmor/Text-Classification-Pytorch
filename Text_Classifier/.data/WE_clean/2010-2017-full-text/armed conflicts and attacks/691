General McChrystal Accepts Teaching Post at Yale
WASHINGTON – Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top officer in Afghanistan relieved of command for comments to Rolling Stone magazine, has been appointed a senior fellow in global affairs at Yale University beginning this autumn.
The university, in New Haven, Conn., released a statement Monday announcing that General McChrystal had accepted an academic position with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and will teach a master’s seminar in international relations.
“The course will examine how dramatic changes in globalization have increased the complexity of modern leadership,” the university said in a statement.
General McChrystal, one of the most respected four-star officers of his generation, had a long and distinguished career in the secret world of Special Operations forces before taking over as commander of the American and NATO mission in Afghanistan.
But General McChrystal turned in his resignation, which was accepted by President Obama, after the commander and his senior aides appeared in a Rolling Stone profile making comments that were heard as disparaging the civilian leadership.
“General McChrystal brings a wealth of experience in international affairs that will be of tremendous value to our students,” James Levinsohn, director of the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, said in the statement. General McChrystal was replaced by Gen. David H. Petraeus in the commander’s post in Afghanistan.
