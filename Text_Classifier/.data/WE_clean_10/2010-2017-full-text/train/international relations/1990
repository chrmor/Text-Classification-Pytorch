South Koreans investigated for 'trying to defect to North'
Prosecutors in Seoul have applied for arrest warrants for the three suspects who attempted to defect while on a trip to China last February, South Korea's official Yonhap news agency reported on Friday.
It is extremely unusual for South Koreans to attempt to defect to the North which remains one of the most tightly politically controlled states on earth. In contrast, since the end of the Korean War in 1953 some 19,000 people have crossed over in the other direction.
The three are said to have met through an online community forum and decided to defect after becoming "disillusioned" with life in the South, according to sources at the prosecutors' office quoted by Yonhap.
It is common for North Korean defectors to have difficulty adjusting to their new lives in South Korea, and prosecutors said they were investigating whether any of them had succeeded in making contact with the North during their stay in China.
The grim living conditions of most of North Korea's 23m population were highlighted again by a United Nations report that warned that North Korea was heading for a new food crisis, with predictions that this year's harvest would be 20pc below 2009 levels after floods earlier this year.
Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, has expressed concern "that the acute humanitarian needs" of at least 3.5 million women and children in North Korea will deepen still further.
North Korea continues to labour under tough UN sanctions imposed after two illegal nuclear tests and the alleged torpedoing of a South Korean warship in March.
Despite the deteriorating situation, South Korea has said it will not resume major food aid until North Korea takes steps to meet the demands of the international community.
