Nigerian Market Hit by Suicide Bomber
ABUJA—A female suicide bomber killed herself and 19 other people at a market in northeastern Nigeria’s largest city on Saturday, capping a week of attacks in the region.
The woman walked into the Monday Market in Maiduguri around 1 p.m. local time, said Mohammed Adamu, a member of a vigilante group that had been trying to screen potential bombers from entering the market, which had been bombed last month, killing five people.
