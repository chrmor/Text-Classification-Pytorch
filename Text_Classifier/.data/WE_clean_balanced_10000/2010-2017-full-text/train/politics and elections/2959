Solomon Islands Prime Ministerial contenders named
The two contenders for Prime Minister in Solomon Islands are Danny Philip and Steve Abana.
The 50 MPs elected two and half weeks ago are to meet for the first time on Wednesday next week to choose a new national leader and nominations for the post closed this afternoon.
For the past week the MPs have been cloistered in two camps around Honiara as attempts have been made to determine which has the majority.
The Heritage Hotel group chose Mr Abana, who's the leader of the Solomon Islands Democratic Party which won the most seats in the election two weeks ago.
The rival camp has gone for veteran politician Danny Philip, who has previously served both as Foreign Minister and as a diplomat.
