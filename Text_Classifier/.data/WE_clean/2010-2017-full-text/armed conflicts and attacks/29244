Palestinians: 19-year-old killed by Israeli forces near Ramallah
A 19-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli security forces early on Sunday morning in a village near Ramallah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
An IDF official said that the military is examining the report that a Palestinian was killed and another was wounded in clashes that took place overnight in the West Bank village of Beit Rima.
According to the IDF, some 50 Palestinians were involved in the clash, some of whom threw stones at Israeli security forces. A Border Police officer was wounded. The army said that the forces responded to the stone-throwing with riot control measures and with shooting in the air.
The health ministry identified the 19-year-old as Ahmed Arimawi, saying that a live bullet struck him the chest during clash. He was seriously wounded and transferred to hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds.
Clashes have been taking place between the army and youths in the village over the past three days against the backdrop of searches and arrests being carried out there.
Palestinian media reported that Ahmed Arimawi is the son of Hazem Arimawi, who was released from Israeli prison three months ago after serving a 15-year sentence for security-related offenses.
