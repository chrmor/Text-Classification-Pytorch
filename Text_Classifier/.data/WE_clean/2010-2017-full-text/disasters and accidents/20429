10 dead after buses crash head-on in central Vietnam
A north-bound sleeper bus collided with another coach early Monday in the south-central province of Binh Thuan, killing 10 people and injuring 9 others.
The accident occurred at around 2 p.m in Binh Thuanâ€™s Ham Thuan Nam District. The sleeper bus, which departed from Ho Chi Minh City and was en route to the north-central province of Nghe An, reportedly veered into the opposite lane and crashed into the other coach that was traveling to HCMC.
The crash killed 10 people on the spot, including 9 on board the HCMC-bound bus. It was not immediately clear if the drivers of the two buses were among the dead.
Nine other people on the Nghe An-bound bus were injured. Local authorities have rushed to the scene to direct rescue work.
Further investigations into the cause of the accident are underway.
Traffic accidents are not uncommon to Vietnam, which often records a spike in casualties during national holidays.
Narrow highways, poorly maintained vehicles and drivers' disregard for road safety and traffic rules are often the cause of most fatalities.
State employees will have nine days off for the upcoming Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday, which will begin on February 15 and end on February 23. Travels are expected to peak during this period.
During the nine-day Tet break last year, 286 people were killed and 324 injured in traffic accidents.
