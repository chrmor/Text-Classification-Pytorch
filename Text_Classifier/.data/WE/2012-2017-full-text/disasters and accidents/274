State flood disaster declared in Qld
A state disaster has been declared in southeast Queensland, and a Disaster Coordinator appointed, as floodwaters continue to rise across the region.
Premier Anna Bligh says Deputy Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has been appointed by the State Disaster Management Group to oversee the flood response operation.
"Ian Stewart was at my side during last year's natural disasters, and as the emergency unfolds in the southwest it is heartening to have him in the position again," she said.
"The Deputy Commissioner did an outstanding job last year and that experience will stand him in good stead."
The Maranoa River at Mitchell is expected to peak at 10m on Friday night, a new record, with Roma, St George and other towns facing damaging flood peaks on Saturday and Sunday.
"We are in new territory here, the water coming through is breaking records for this region," Ms Bligh said.
"I have been in direct contact with mayors and the situation is unfolding. I will visit these regions as soon as it is safe and practicable to do so."
