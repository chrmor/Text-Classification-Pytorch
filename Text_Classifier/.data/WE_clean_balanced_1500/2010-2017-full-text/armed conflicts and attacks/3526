Pakistan billiard hall bombs kill dozens
At least 52 dead and more than 100 injured in attack in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan province
Police say 52 people have died in a twin bombing at a billiard hall in southwest Pakistan.
Police officer Mohammed Murtaza says the attack in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, also wounded more than 100 people.
Police officer Hamid Shakeel says the bombs went off about 10 minutes apart late on Thursday evening.
Murtaza says many people were killed and wounded when the second bomb caused the building to collapse. He says many of the dead and wounded are Shia Muslims.
Radical Sunni Muslims have stepped up attacks in Baluchistan this year against Shia, who they consider heretics.
