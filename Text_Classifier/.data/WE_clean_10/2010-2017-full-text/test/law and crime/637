Gary Glitter faces prospect of dying in jail after more victims come forward
Gary Glitter, the former Glam Rock star, faces the prospect of dying in jail after police revealed he could face further charges following his conviction for sexually abusing three young girls.
Glitter, described as a “habitual sexual predator”, became the fourth celebrity to be brought to justice as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
The 70-year-old – tried under his real name Paul Gadd - was convicted of one count of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. His youngest victim was less than 10 years old, the others 12 and 13.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court was not told that Glitter had already served a jail sentence in Vietnam for obscene acts with minors, and following the guilty verdict on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police hinted that he could face further action.
DCI Mick Orchard from the Met's Operation Yewtree describes Gary Glitter as a "sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him by targeting young girls who trusted him and were in awe of his fame"
Asked if any more alleged victims had come forward during the trial, a Met spokesman said: “Officers have received other information and it is currently being assessed."
He will be sentenced on February 27 for offences that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Glitter was the first person to be arrested by detectives conducting Operation Yewtree - the inquiry launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Glitter, who wore a black fur coat in the dock, had denied the charges against him, cruelly accusing his victims of making up the allegations knowing he had been convicted of child pornography and sex abuse charges in the past.
Peter Watt, director of national services for the NSPCC children’s charity, said: "Glitter was devious and manipulative throughout this trial. Thankfully the jury has seen through all the fake tears and his attempts to paint his victims as liars, gold diggers or opportunistic fantasists.
"He tried to portray himself as the victim in this case, as a remorseful, penitent man who had paid for his previous crimes but now faced malicious new allegations. It was just another performance.”
Mr Watt said Glitter had "used the adoration of fans to violate young girls and satisfy his perversions”.
He was cleared of two counts of indecent assault and one count of administering a drug or other thing in order to facilitate sexual intercourse.
It was the first time he had been convicted of sex abuse in this country, though he had a previous conviction for child pornography offences in the UK and was jailed in Vietnam in 2006 for obscene acts with minors.
Glitter was at the height of his fame when he preyed on the youngsters, who thought no one would believe their word over that of a celebrity.
His youngest victim was less than 10 years old when he crept into her bed and tried to rape her in 1975. He also attacked two girls, aged 12 and 13, after inviting them backstage to his dressing room, and isolating them from their mothers.
Detective Chief Inspector Mick Orchard of Operation Yewtree said: "Paul Gadd has shown himself to be a habitual sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him by targeting young girls who trusted him and were in awe of his fame.
"His lack of remorse and defence that the victims were lying makes his crimes all the more indefensible. I am pleased that the jury were able to see through this."
Glitter had tried to avoid facing trial by claiming he would not get a fair hearing after decades of adverse publicity, but Judge Alistair McCreath dismissed the legal bid.

It was the first time Glitter had been convicted of sex abuse in this country. His is the fourth high-profile scalp to be claimed by the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree which has already seen former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, children's entertainer Rolf Harris and PR Guru Max Clifford convicted of historic sexual offences.
Glitter, described by one victim as “bigger than Elvis”, was at the height of his fame when he preyed on the youngsters, and thought no one would believe their word over that of a celebrity.
Baljit Ubhey, chief Crown prosecutor and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in London, said: "Paul Gadd abused his access to young fans in order to give himself the opportunities to assault and abuse his victims. Crimes such as these have repercussions for victims that can last for a lifetime.
"The bravery of the victims and other witnesses in this case cannot be understated and their testimony has been vital in bringing Paul Gadd to justice. I hope today's verdict will be of some small help to these victims.
"It should also provide other victims of sexual abuse with the courage to come forward, knowing their case will be handled with sensitivity and professionalism."
