Explosion at Chinese auto parts factory kills 68, injures many more
The explosion is one of the worst industrial accidents in China in recent years. The unusually high death toll and the foreign ownership of the plant is likely to prompt the government to look carefully at whether negligence was involved. A senior Chinese official, state councilor Wang Yong, was being dispatched from Beijing to visit the scene, state media reported.
