TEHRAN (FNA)- Yemeni army and popular committees fired missiles at a Saudi warship, and destroyed it in Bab al-Mandab Strait.
The warship was wrecked off the Southwestern coast of Yemen, in the Bab al-Mandab Strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.
Other Saudi battleships fled the area following the attack.
The sunken ship had repeatedly fired rockets on residential areas in Ta'iz province, inflicting casualties and destruction there.
Earlier, the Yemeni forces attacked a Saudi military base in the kingdom's province of Jizan, killing a soldier in retaliation for Riyadh's aggression against their nation. The Saudi Interior Ministry has confirmed the death of the trooper.
Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen for 197 days now to restore power to Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. The Saudi-led aggression has so far killed at least 6,481 Yemenis, including hundreds of women and children.
Hadi stepped down in January and refused to reconsider the decision despite calls by Ansarullah revolutionaries of the Houthi movement.
Despite Riyadhâ€™s claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi warplanes are flattening residential areas and civilian infrastructures.
