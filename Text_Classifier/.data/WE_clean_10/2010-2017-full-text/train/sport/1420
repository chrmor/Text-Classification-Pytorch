Lionel Messi scored 91st and final goal of record-breaking season
Lionel Messi scored his final goal of a record breaking year as Barcelona won 3-1 against Valladolid on Saturday night.
Messi's second-half strike was his 91st of the season, nutmegging a defender and rattling home with his deadly left-foot to sign off in style.
He broke Gerd Muller's 40-year-old milestone of 85 goals in a calendar year by grabbing 79 for Barcelona and 12 for Argentina.
The victory leaves Barcelona nine points clear of Atletico Madrid in second and 16 points up on Real Madrid, before they take to the field against Malaga later on.
It was achieved without manager Tito Vilanova who was released from hospital just before the match after having throat surgery to remove a tumour.
Both teams wore T-shirts which carried messages of support for the manager, who will undergo chemotherapy in upcoming weeks.
'This win is for Tito,' said Barcelona defender Dani Alves.
'It's a surprise and joy that he is home now. We are here to help him any way he can. Football is secondary now, he is fighting for his life.'
