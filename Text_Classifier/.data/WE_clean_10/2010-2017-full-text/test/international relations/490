Clinton labels Pakistan-based group as terrorists
The group, the Haqqani network, also has extensive real estate and commercial interests. Its broad ties to the Taliban and its base in Pakistan had held out the possibility that the Haqqani network could be the key to a peace deal in Afghanistan.
"The consequences of these designations include a prohibition against knowingly providing material support or resources to, or engaging in other transactions with, the Haqqani Network, and the freezing of all property and interests in property of the organization that are in the United States, or come within the United States, or the control of U.S. persons," Clinton said in a statement.
From its base in Pakistan's North Waziristan region, the Haqqani network has drawn the ire of the U.S. government with members of its top leadership already being designated as terrorists -- which freezes any of their personal assets held in U.S. banks.
There had been concern that a foreign terrorist organization label would drive the Haqqanis away from a possible peace deal in Afghanistan and undermine ties with the Pakistani government. The group, with its links to other Taliban entities, was considered integral to the political reconciliation the United States was seeking, senior U.S. officials have told CNN.
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also hailed the designation. The California Democrat urged Clinton to make the move in May and introduced legislation in July instructing the secretary of state to designate the network as a foreign terrorist organization.
"This is an internal matter for the United States," Hotiana said. "The Haqqanis are not Pakistani nationals. We will continue to work with all international partners including the U.S. in combating extremism and terrorism."
The Haqqanis are Zadran tribesman from Afghanistan's Paktia and Khost provinces but have been in and out of Pakistan for the past 30 years, said Jeffrey Dressler, an analyst with the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.
They own car dealerships, money exchanges and construction companies. The group has commercial and residential real-estate holdings and import-export operations, Dressler said. But he cites a report that the group also profits from "kidnapping, extortion and protection rackets" on the Afghan-Pakistani border.
The Haqqani network receives funding from the Taliban, though a significant portion of its money is said to come from deep-pocketed donors in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to a recent report by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, New York.
The designation as a foreign terrorist organization "could reduce a critical capability of the Haqqani Network by increasing the cost of doing business, reducing access to capital, and constraining the network's financial resources, thereby limiting their freedom to operate in a local, regional, and international context," Dressler said.
Founded by Jalaluddin Haqqani after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the group initially worked with the United States and its allies to expel the Soviets. Since suffering a stroke in 2005, Jalaluddin Haqqani has essentially retired and his son, Sirajuddin, has taken command.
The designation by the State Department comes at a critical time for the United States, as combat operations in Afghanistan come to a close in 2014 and it looks to withdraw, in some cases through Pakistan.
The move also raises questions about the fate of suspected Haqqani captives, including U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was believed to have been captured in June 2009 by Haqqani loyalists in eastern Afghanistan.
