Pakistan blast 'kills seven' at bus station
At least seven people have been killed in a suicide-bomb attack at a bus station in north-west Pakistan.
Twenty-two were also injured in the town of Jandool in Lower Dir, where Pakistani troops fought a major offensive against the Taliban in 2009.
A member of a government-backed peace committee, set up to maintain security after the offensive, was reported to have been killed in the blast.
Militants frequently launch attacks in districts close to the Afghan border.
But no group has yet said it carried out the latest attack - the sixth bombing in Pakistan in as many days.
Regional deputy inspector Qazi Jamil ur-Rehman told the AFP news agency: "It was a suicide attack. The bomber was on foot. We're investigating what the target was."
The wounded from the blast were taken to two nearby hospitals and authorities warned that the death toll could rise, Pakistan's APP news agency reported.
On Sunday dozens of people were killed when a Sufi Muslim shrine was attacked in central Punjab province.
Suicide attackers struck near the Sakhi Sarwar shrine in Punjab, as Sufi Muslim devotees gathered for an annual three-day festival.
Authorities said on Monday that the death toll had risen to 50.
