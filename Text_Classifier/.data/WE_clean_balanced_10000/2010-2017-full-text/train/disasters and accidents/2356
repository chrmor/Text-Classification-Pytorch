WEIYUAN, Sichuan - All 29 trapped miners were pulled out of the flooded coal mine pit alive at around 1:18 pm Monday, one day after the accident happened at 11 am Sunday.
The rescued miners, with no visible injuries but looking weak, were instantly sent to the No 2 Hospital of Neijiang City and the People's Hospital of Weiyuan County, Xinhua reporters said at the scene.
Rescuers pulled out the first trapped miner at about 12:25 local time and a vice-manager, Zhang Hongliang, was the last who was rescued.
The accident happened at 11 am Sunday when 35 miners were working underground at Batian Coal Mine in Weiyuan County of Neijiang City. Thirteen of them rushed out while the other 22 were left behind.
After the accident, seven rescuers, led by the vice-manager, descended to free the miners but were trapped underground, too.
