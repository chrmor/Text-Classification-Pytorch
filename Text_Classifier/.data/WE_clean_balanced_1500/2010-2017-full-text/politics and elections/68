Zambia Votes Amid Economic Slowdown and Political Violence
“It’s a global problem,” he said, raising a clenched fist, the sign of the president’s party.
Seeing the fist, a jobless man, Isaac Chikopa, 23, interjected. He said that Mr. Lungu and his party, which took over the presidency five years ago, had mismanaged the economy.
“Five years ago, I used to have three meals a day, and now I have one,” said Mr. Chikopa, adding that he was voting for Mr. Hichilema.
In a region known for presidents brutally clinging to office for decades, Zambia had smooth elections and transfers of power since 1991, long before multiparty democracies emerged elsewhere on the continent. But a handful of people have been killed and many others injured in recent political violence.
Observers have attributed the violence to the two main parties, the Patriotic Front of Mr. Lungu and the United Party for National Development of Mr. Hichilema. On Tuesday, Esau E. Chulu, the chairman of the Electoral Commission, said that the violence was “unprecedented and has marred Zambia’s historic record of peaceful elections.”
But some observers said that the Patriotic Front, as the governing party, bore greater responsibility for the violence. The police have often acted in favor of the party, and tax authorities shut down The Post, the country’s only independent newspaper, in the middle of the campaign.
Catherine Musuva, the Zambia director for the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa, said that the authorities had failed to sufficiently use the police to ensure security and a level playing field during the campaign.
