Drogba signs for Galatasaray
Didier Drogba has signed for Turkish champions Galatasaray on an 18-month deal from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. 
The former Chelsea striker, 34, was linked with a return to Stamford Bridge after training with the Blues during his off-season. Italian sides Juventus and AC Milan were also believed to be interested.
But in choosing to play in Turkey, Drogba joins Wesley Sneijder, who recently signed for Galatasaray from Inter Milan.
Drogba said through his representatives, Sports PR Company, on Twitter:  “The opportunity to play for this great club was an offer that I could not turn down.
“I am looking forward to playing in the Champions League again, against the best clubs in Europe.”
Drogba's move to Turkey brings to an end a six-month stint in China. He moved to Shanghai in June, soon after helping Chelsea win their first Champions League title when he scored the winning penalty in a dramatic shootout victory over Bayern Munich.
The Ivory Coast captain signed a two-and-a-half year deal, reportedly worth £200,000 a week, with Shanghai but was repeatedly linked with a move back to Europe in recent months.
Gala are five points clear at the top of the Super Lig standings and are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they face Schalke.
