NSW upper house votes for adoption bill
A bill giving same-sex couples the right to adopt has been passed by both houses of the NSW parliament after the Legislative Council voted in support of the legislation on Wednesday night.
But the bill still has one final hurdle - with a vote in the lower house now required on two upper house amendments.
In a vote on Wednesday night, upper house MPs voted 22-15 in favour of the bill after agreeing to the changes.
Support was given to an amendment by Attorney-General John Hatzistergos that narrowed an exemption for faith-based adoption agencies granted in a previous amendment from Planning Minister Frank Sartor.
"The amendment that was past in the lower house would have extended not only to the faith-based agencies, but the secular agencies, including the department ... then be on grounds which have nothing to do with religious conviction," Mr Hatzistergos told parliament on Wednesday night.
An amendment from Christian Democratic MP Fred Nile providing more information to birth parents about prospective adoptive parents was also backed by the upper house MPs.
