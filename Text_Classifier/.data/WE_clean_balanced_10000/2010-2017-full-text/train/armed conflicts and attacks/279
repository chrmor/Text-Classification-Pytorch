Kidnapped son of former Pakistan PM Yousaf Raza Gilani found alive
US and Afghan forces have found the kidnapped son of a former Pakistani prime minister alive in an operation in Afghanistan, the Pakistan foreign ministry said in a statement.
Ali Haider Gilani, the son of Yousaf Raza Gilani, "has been recovered today in a joint operation carried out by the Afghan and US security forces in Ghazni, Afghanistan", the statement said.
The recovery comes three years after he was kidnapped by suspected Taliban militants in Pakistan.
Gunmen took Mr Gilani and shot dead two of his aides on the last day of campaigning for 2013 elections.
Police at the time said the candidate for the Punjab provincial assembly was seized on the outskirts of the city of Multan in the province.
The kidnappers on motorbikes and a car opened fire and abducted Mr Gilani, police said, injuring five other people.
The Pakistan People's Party was one of the parties targeted by the Taliban in a pre-election terrorism campaign which claimed the lives of more than 100 people.
