Israel says its navy has boarded two boats carrying pro-Palestinian activists trying to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.
The boats had set sail from Turkey on Wednesday, carrying medical supplies and 27 activists from nine countries including Australia the United States.
Flotilla organisers said the boats were travelling about 50 nautical miles from the shore when they were contacted by the Israeli navy and told to turn back.
The Israeli navy said it advised the vessels to turn back or sail to Ashdod port in Israel or to Egypt, but the activists refused to cooperate.
The navy said its seizure of the vessels took place peacefully.
Michael Coleman from Sydney was on board the flotilla when the Israeli navy intercepted the boats.
Kate Ausburn from Free Gaza Australia says Mr Coleman made contact last night but they have not heard from him since.
"Shortly after [the boats were intercepted] the Israeli defence forces were the only form of contact we had with the people on board those boats," she said.
"The IDF released a statement confirming that their navy had boarded the boats and would be taking all the passengers to Ashdod Port in Israel."
In May 2010, Israeli commandos boarded the Turkish Mavi Marmara aid vessel to enforce the naval blockade of the Palestinian enclave and killed nine Turks in clashes with activists.
Israel spurned Turkey's demand for an apology over the incident and Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador two months ago after ties broke down.
