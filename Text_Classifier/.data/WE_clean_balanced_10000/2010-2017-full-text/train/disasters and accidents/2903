Harvey, Now a Tropical Storm, Carves a Path of Destruction Through Texas
Speaking at a televised news conference in Austin, Governor Abbott said state and other agencies remained active in search and rescue efforts. “We don’t have any information right now that we can confirm” about fatalities, he said.
He warned Texans to be vigilant and to stay away from rising water, noting that it can be far deeper, with swifter currents, than it may appear.
“Turn around, don’t drown. Don’t risk your life,” he said. “The most important thing all Texans can do is to put your life and the protection of your life first and foremost.”
He said agencies were focused on supporting evacuees from Corpus Christi and elsewhere, and on getting supplies, such as food, water and ice, to areas that needed it. —JOHANNA BARR in New York
The storm remained a hurricane well after landfall, and conditions, including tornado warnings, made it difficult for the authorities to begin even preliminary damage assessments.
More than 250,000 customers were without electricity early Saturday, a figure that was likely to increase. Corpus Christi urged people who were still in the city to boil water.
Images and videos on social media showed substantial damage to buildings, including roofs and walls pulled away. Power lines were toppled, and phone service was down.
Early rainfall totals were staggering. The National Hurricane Center said that an automated rain gauge near Victoria, a city of about 68,000 in the path of the storm, had recorded more than 16 inches in 24 hours.
As rains picked up in Houston before daybreak on Saturday, the lights began to blink and, in some areas, go out. The city’s roads, largely quiet since Friday evening, were almost entirely empty. — ALAN BLINDER in Houston
Rockport, a coastal city of about 10,000 that was in the hurricane’s path when it came ashore. Charles J. Wax, Rockport’s mayor, said that conditions were too dangerous on Saturday morning to deploy emergency officials across the city, but that an initial review, as the storm’s eye passed overnight, showed “widespread damage.”
“Homes and businesses completely destroyed, lives disrupted,” said Mr. Wax, who said that a Fairfield Inn and Suites had sustained heavy damage. “We do not know if there is any loss of life, but that may be because we haven’t been able to assess.”
“We took a Category 4 storm right on the nose,” said Mr. Wax, who had issued a mandatory evacuation order. — ALAN BLINDER in Houston
About 4,500 inmates at three prison units in Rosharon, Tex., were being bused to other facilities as the nearby Brazos River rose under heavy rain. By noon, the river had swelled by at least 15 feet since Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Read more »
Houston residents woke to light rain and an overcast sky. At a Walmart north of downtown, a few people came in for last-minute supplies. But some shelves had been emptied by hurricane-wary residents the night before. Employees said they would close the store at noon.
Juan Cruz, 52, wheeled a cart out the door. He’d noticed that rain from the night before had caused his roof to leak, and he’d bought a tarp to cover it, hoping to stay dry if things got worse. Mr. Cruz, a mechanic, said he lived through Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and remembered the devastation. The storm killed his neighbors, flooded roads and tore up bridges, he said.
“Maybe it won’t be that bad,” he said. “It depends on God.” — JULIE TURKEWITZ in Houston
As thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate on Friday, and others chose to leave on their own, inland cities welcomed an influx of evacuees on Friday.
