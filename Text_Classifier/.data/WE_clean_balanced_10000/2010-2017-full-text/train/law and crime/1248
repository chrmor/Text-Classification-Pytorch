London riots arrests reach 2,000, Met Police says
The Metropolitan Police said it has now arrested more than 2,000 people in connection with rioting and looting across London earlier this month.
Scotland Yard said that 2,006 people had been arrested and of those 1,135 had been charged.
Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that, across England, almost 1,500 people have appeared in court to answer riot-related charges.
Some 70% of alleged offenders have been remanded in custody.
Scotland Yard said 954 of those charged over London's disturbances had already appeared before the court, 82 had been sentenced and 42 jailed.
The force has also launched an online galleryof some of those offenders, detailing their crimes and sentences.
Commander Simon Foy said: "We have made these pictures available so that communities across London can see that those who took part in the appalling scenes which shocked us all have been brought to justice.
"I want to send a clear message to those involved that you will not get away with it.
"The determination and dedication of officers from all parts of the Met have led to this important milestone, but we are far from finished. The investigation into the widespread criminality we saw remains a major task on an unprecedented scale.
"We have got to this point with fantastic support from the public and I urge anyone with any information to come forward."
Of the 1,500 offenders who have appeared in courts nationwide, more than 160 have already been sentenced and half of them jailed.
One in 10 of the 300 juveniles who have been appeared in court have received custodial sentences. Nine out of 10 of the offenders currently being dealt with were male.
On Thursday, five men were jailed at Wood Green Crown Court for looting Zee & Co clothing store in Bethnal Green, east London.
About £100,000 damage was caused to the store and £646,524 goods taken on 8 and 9 August.
