Massive London march against austerity â€“ This Just In
Amid a din of whistles and klaxons, and bearing banners emblazoned with "No cuts" and "Austerity is failing," thousands of protesters marched past London's landmarks Saturday in a show of popular anger over government cutbacks.
"I don't like the government's policy, I don't think it works and I think the most vulnerable people suffer - that's why I'm here," said one woman on the march.
The planned cuts to services and payments that help the sick and disabled are "shameful," she said.
Culminating in a mass rally in Hyde Park, the protest, staged by unions representing public sector workers and others, reflects a rising tide of discontent among many over the austerity measures brought in or proposed by the coalition government.
