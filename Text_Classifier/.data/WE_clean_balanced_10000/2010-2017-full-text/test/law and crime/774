China Suspends Boat Traffic on Mekong
HONG KONG — China announced Monday that it was suspending passenger and cargo traffic in the headwaters of the Mekong River after the Thai border police heard gunfire on the river, found two Chinese cargo vessels adrift carrying 920,000 amphetamine pills and one body, and then discovered the floating bodies of 11 Chinese crewmen.
Liu Weimin, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, announced the suspension of river traffic and said that China’s cabinet and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party “attached great importance to the matter.”
As postings on the Internet in China have become increasingly nationalistic, and increasingly critical of government agencies not perceived as taking a strong enough stand to defend the country, the Foreign Ministry and other agencies have become outspoken in response to the deaths of Chinese citizens abroad.
But that sensitivity comes as drug-related violence continues along the Mekong River, which flows south from Yunnan Province in southwestern China.
Maj. Gen. Songtham Allapach, the police chief in Chiang Rai, the northernmost province in Thailand, said in a telephone interview that the two Chinese vessels had probably been seized by drug traffickers from northern Myanmar. Drug gangs demand protection money from vessels using the river, and sometimes hijack them to carry illicit cargo.
Thai soldiers periodically hear gunfire from the section of the river north of Thailand that runs along the border between Laos and Myanmar. That was the case again before the two Chinese cargo vessels floated down to Thailand, said Col. Popkorn Khuncharoensuk, a police investigator working on the case.
