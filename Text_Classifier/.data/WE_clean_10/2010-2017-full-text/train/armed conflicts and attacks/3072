Several killed in police station attack in China's restive province bordering Pakistan
BEIJING: Violent clashes left several people dead after rioters attacked a police station in China’s restive province of Xingjian . At least four persons were killed by the rioters while the police gunned down “several rioters” , the official media reported Monday quoting police sources. The rioters took several people hostage during the attack on the police station in Hotan town in the province. This is the first major case of rioters taking hostages in China’s western region bordering Pakistan, which is a major source of Islamic ultras A report circulated in unofficial web sites said the police have managed to free six hostages by challenging the rioters, but there has been no official confirmation for this report. The rioters broke into the police station Monday afternoon, and “assaulted the police, took hostages and set fire to the station.” Two hostages, a member of the armed police and a security officer were killed in the attack, while another security official was severely injured, the official Xinhua news agency said. It said the police “shot a number of rioters” while freeing the hostages. The cause of the clashes is still not known but there are signs the attack on the police station is related to the separatist movement of East Turkmenistan being conduction by a section of the Muslim Uighur population in Xingjian. The Uighur ultras attacked a police station killing 16 constables and officers in 2008. This was followed by clashes between Uighurs and the majority Han community in July 2009 that left 197 dead. Last August, they detonated an explosive in a group of paramilitary officers resulting in the death of seven persons in the city of Aksu. Xinhua said the national counterterrorism office has dispatched “a working team” to the region.
