Nine people were killed in a fire on a train in western India early Wednesday, railway authorities said.
The blaze ripped through three coaches of the Dehradun Express train at around 2.30 a.m., western railway spokesman Sharat Chandrayan told CNN.
The train was headed to Dehradun, in northern India, from Mumbai when the fire broke out.
Five of the bodies have been identified, Chandrayan said. The others are being kept in a hospital 125 kilometers from Mumbai.
There were no serious injuries, he said.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
