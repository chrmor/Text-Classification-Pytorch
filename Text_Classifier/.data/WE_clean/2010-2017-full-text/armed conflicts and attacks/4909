Albania: Thousands of Protesters Demand a New Government
Tens of thousands of Albanian opposition supporters, right, marched peacefully through the capital, Tirana, on Friday to demand that the government resign over corruption allegations, almost a month after four people died when a similar demonstration turned violent. The opposition Socialists are demanding that Prime Minister Sali Berisha hold early elections over allegations of corruption and vote-rigging in the 2009 general election. Mr. Berisha has refused to resign, accusing the opposition of trying to stage a coup. Opposition officials said some 200,000 people took part in the demonstration, while the police estimated 7,000.
