Stephen R. Covey dead after bike accident, "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" author was 79
SALT LAKE CITY - Stephen R. Covey, author of "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" as well as three other books that have all sold more than a million copies, has died. He was 79.
In a statement sent to employees of a Utah consulting firm Covey co-founded, his family said the writer and motivational speaker died at a hospital in Idaho Falls, Idaho, early Monday due to complications from a bicycle accident in April.
"In his final hours, he was surrounded by his loving wife and each one of his children and their spouses, just as he always wanted," the family said.
Covey was hospitalized after being knocked unconscious in the bicycle accident on a steep road in the foothills of Provo, Utah, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City.
At the time, his publicist, Debra Lund, said doctors had not found any signs of long-term damage to his head.
"He just lost control on his bike and crashed," Lund said. "He was wearing a helmet, which is good news."
Covey is the author of "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" and co-founder of Utah-based professional services company FranklinCovey.
Catherine Sagers, Covey's daughter, told The Salt Lake Tribune in April that her father had suffered some bleeding on his brain after the bicycle accident.
