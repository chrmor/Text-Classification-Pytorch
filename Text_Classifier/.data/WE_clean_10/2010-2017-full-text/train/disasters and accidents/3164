Western Cape bus crash toll rises to 20+
Cape Town - At least 22 people died when a bus veered off the Hex River Pass near De Doorns on Friday morning, Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said. "It was a passenger bus on its way to Cape Town when the bus driver lost control." He said several people, three of them children, were critically injured. Fourteen people were seriously injured and 22 were slightly injured. "There are still people trapped in the bus, as well as the driver, and we are pulling up the bus now," he said. ER24 spokesperson Vanessa Jackson said the double-decker bus was crushed against the side of the mountain along the pass. She initially said paramedics had recorded a death count of 13, but that this figure could change as officials cut away at the wreckage.
