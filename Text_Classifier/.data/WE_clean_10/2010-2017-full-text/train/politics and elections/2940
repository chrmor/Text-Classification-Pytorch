Gillard defends citizens assembly
Prime Minister Julia Gillard is defending Labor's climate change credentials, including the much-ridiculed plan for a citizens assembly.
A re-elected Gillard government would appoint 150 randomly-selected Australians to assess published climate science and policies to combat the impact of climate change, such as an emissions trading scheme.
Ms Gillard said the assembly was part of a "wide breadth" of climate policies Labor was proposing, including incentives for fuel-efficient cars and a ban on new dirty coal-fired power stations.
"Our climate change policy comes from someone who believes in climate change," she told the Nine Network on Sunday.
"The citizens assembly will be one vehicle for taking the community through the debate."
Labor in April delayed introduction of its planned carbon pollution reduction scheme until at least 2013.
