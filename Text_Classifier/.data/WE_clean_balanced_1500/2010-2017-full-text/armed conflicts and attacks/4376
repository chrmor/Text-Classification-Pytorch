BP discovers unexploded German bomb next to vital North Sea oil pipeline
The discovery of an unexploded bomb on the seabed next to Britain's most important North Sea pipeline is threatening to shut down dozens of oil fields and force up the price of crude.
The German second world war mine was found by BP during a routine inspection and its removal could involve temporarily shutting off a transportation system that carries more than half a million barrels of crude a day â€“ or 40% of Britain's total output.
The explosive was found in 300ft of water some 25 miles off the coast of Peterhead, Scotland, and caused no immediate danger, allowing the fields and pipeline to be operated as normal, said BP. However, a guard vessel has been stationed in the area to ensure other vessels are kept clear.
The Ministry of Defence has been informed and bomb disposal experts consulted as the oil company works out how best to deal with the threat. The most likely course is for a remotely operated vehicle to throw a net over the mine and drag it to a safe place to be detonated, said a BP spokesman. "If we do need to remove and dispose of it [the mine] then we may need to shut the pipeline for a few days," he added.
