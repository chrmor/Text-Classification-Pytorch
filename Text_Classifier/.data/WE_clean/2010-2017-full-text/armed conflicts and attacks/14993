Nigeria: Teachers wounded in primary school shooting
Men on motorbikes stormed a primary school in Nigeria today and opened fire on the teachers. Four teachers have been wounded. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but the Boko Haram group is the most likely suspect, Reuters reported. The group's nickname literally translates into "Western education is sinful" and has targeted schools before.

"They made the teachers lie down on the ground, then there were gunshot sounds and everyone scampered to safety," Hauwa Jinjiri, a trader working on the school premises who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. 
"The gunmen shot and injured four teachers including the headmaster and fled but we have opened an investigation into the attack and have deployed policemen...for a manhunt," Kano state Police Commissioner Musa Daura told Agence France Presse.
The attack comes just several days after Islamists killed 7 foreign hostages in Nigeria.
