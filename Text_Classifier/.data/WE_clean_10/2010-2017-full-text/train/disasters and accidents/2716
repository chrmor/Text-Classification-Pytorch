Migrants hit by train in Macedonia, state TV says 14 dead
SKOPJE, April 24 (Reuters) - Macedonian state television reported 14 migrants were killed near the central city of Veles late on Thursday, hit by a train as they walked through a canyon along an increasingly well-trodden Balkan route for migrants trying to reach western Europe.
