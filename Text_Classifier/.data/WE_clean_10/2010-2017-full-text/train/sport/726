Players to miss World Cup due to Fiji travel ban
Several Fijian rugby stars may be forced to miss the Rugby World Cup after the Government today announced that New Zealand would not relax its travel ban on Fiji.
At current there is a travel ban on all Fijian military personnel from coming into New Zealand, this includes several national Fijian rugby players from the military.
Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully reiterated the Government’s stance today, in an official press conference 100 days out from the World Cup.
Vidhya Lakhan, the president of the Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee, is calling on the International Rugby Board to shift Fiji’s games out of New Zealand, according to radiofiji.com.
Mr Lakham says Fiji should boycott the World Cup if the IRB does not resolve the issue.
Prime Minister John Key says the ban will not be relaxed unless something substantial changes in Fiji.
