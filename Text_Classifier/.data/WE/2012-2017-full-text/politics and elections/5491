Brawl breaks out during Ukrainian parliament session
Opposition lawmakers clash with deputies of the pro-presidential majority during a parliament session in Kiev, Ukraine, on Tuesday. Opposition lawmakers demanded the use of the Ukrainian language, not Russian, by all parties as they speak in parliament.
The use of the Russian language is a contentious issue in the Ukraine, where millions consider it their mother tongue while many others see its use as an insult to national pride.
Fistfights have become a relatively common occurrence in parliament since the October 2012 election, which gave the opposition party Svoboda representation and weakened the president's Regions party, though they still command a majority together with traditional communist allies.
