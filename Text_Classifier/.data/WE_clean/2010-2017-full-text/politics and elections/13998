2013 inaugural ceremony to be pushed back a day
Jan. 20 -- presidential Inauguration Day -- is a Sunday, so all the pomp and ceremony will be pushed back a day.
As is tradition, the winner of the November election will be sworn in privately at noon on Jan. 20, but the actual ceremony will be on Jan. 21.
The office of Sen. Charles Schumer, elected to serve as chairman of the 2013 Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, noted "this is the seventh time in U.S. history that the constitutionally mandated inauguration date has fallen on a Sunday."
"The last time was for President Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985," said Schumer's office. "When this occurs, the public ceremonies traditionally are held on Monday."
The announcement added that Jan. 21 "is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It will be the second time that this federal holiday has coincided with a presidential inauguration. The first was President Bill Clinton's second inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 1997."
"The inauguration is a time for our country to come together around our president and celebrate the strength of our democracy," Schumer said. "I am honored to have been selected as the chairman of the festivities and look forward to organizing a ceremony that will showcase the best that America has to offer."
-- James Monroe, 1821 (2nd inauguration) -- This was the first time the inauguration date fell on a Sunday. Monroe decided, after consulting the Supreme Court, to hold the public ceremony on Monday because "courts and other public institutions were not open on Sunday." There was no private swearing-in on March 4, the date the previous term expired.
-- Zachary Taylor, 1849 -- As in 1821, the oath of office was administered Monday, March 5, at the public ceremony.
-- Rutherford B. Hayes, 1877 -- In a break with the practice of Monroe and Taylor, the presidential oath was administered privately to Hayes in the White House Red Room on Saturday, March 3, and repeated publicly at a ceremony on the East Front of the Capitol on Monday, March 5.
-- Woodrow Wilson, 1917 (2nd inauguration) -- The presidential oath was administered privately on Sunday, March 4, in the President's Room of the U.S. Capitol. It was repeated publicly at Capitol ceremonies on Monday, March 5.
-- Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1957 (2nd inauguration) -- After the oath was administered privately in the White House East Room on Jan. 20, 1957, the public ceremony was held on Monday, Jan. 21.
-- Ronald Reagan, 1985 (2nd inauguration) -- Reagan took the oath privately at the White House on Sunday, and again publicly on Monday, Jan. 21, at a public ceremony moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda because of extremely cold weather.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which changed the beginning of a presidential term from March 4 to Jan. 20, was ratified in 1933, and took effect for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term in 1937.
The law designating the third Monday in January as a federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was signed into law by President Reagan in 1983. President Reagan's 1985 inauguration fell on the third Monday of January, but the new federal holiday did not become official until 1986.
