Gunman kills 14 at shrine in Afghan capital Kabul, police say
At least 14 people have been killed after a gunman in a police uniform opened fire on worshippers gathered at a shrine in the Afghan capital of Kabul for a Shiite holy day, officials said.
Thirteen civilians and one police officer died and 36 people were wounded, Ministry of Interior spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said.
The Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack
Ministry of Public Health officials said at least 43 people had been injured in the incident and had been taken to hospitals in the city for treatment.
The attack began just before 8:00pm (local time), police said, with witnesses reporting an explosion followed by gunfire.
Initial reports put the number of attackers at three, but Sediqqi said police special forces who responded to the scene found and killed only one gunman.
The attacker was dressed in a police uniform, according to a police official.
Security forces at the scene evacuated the shrine as the attack unfolded, said Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi.
The attack occurred at one of Kabul's largest shrines as Shiite Muslims gathered to observe the Ashura holy day, which commemorates the 7th century death of a grandson of the prophet Mohammed.
Afghanistan has largely avoided widespread sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, but Afghanistan's Shiite minority has complained of discrimination and has faced increased threats.
At least 84 people were killed and another 130 injured in a suicide attack on a Shiite demonstration in July.
That attack, during a protest march in Kabul, was also claimed by Islamic State militants.
In 2011, Ashura gatherings were targeted by suicide bombers in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, killing about 80 people altogether.
