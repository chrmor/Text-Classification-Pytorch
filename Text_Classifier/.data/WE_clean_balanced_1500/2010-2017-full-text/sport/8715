Kick off for blind football event in Hereford
Ten of the best blind football teams from around the world are beginning a tournament in the West Midlands.
The Football Association-hosted event is taking place at the Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford.
The opening ceremony took place at 1415 BST followed by England v Spain.
The event runs until 22 August and organisers said it is the biggest disability football event ever to be held in this country.
Blind footballers use a ball which contains ball bearings so the motion makes a gentle rattling noise that helps players to locate it.
Other events to coincide with the tournament include An Evening with Trevor Brooking on 18 August, with special guests including Ray Clemence.
