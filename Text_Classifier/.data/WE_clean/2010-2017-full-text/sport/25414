Troyes 0-9 Paris St-Germain
Paris St-Germain were crowned French champions with two months to spare as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored four in a 9-0 demolition of bottom side Troyes.
Edinson Cavani, Javier Pastore and Adrien Rabiot put them 3-0 up inside 19 minutes before Ibrahimovic struck three within 10 minutes in the second half.
Matthieu Saunier scored an own goal and Cavani made it 8-0 before Ibrahimovic added his fourth.
PSG have now won six Ligue 1 titles.
Laurent Blanc's men clinched their fourth-successive title in style with the biggest away win in the history of the competition.
They did it with just one defeat in 30 games after they were beaten 2-1 by Lyon in February, and the latest win took their goal difference to +62, with just 15 league goals conceded.
They have won 24 of their 30 games and Ibrahimovic has scored 31 goals in 25 appearances to add to Cavani's 16 in 27.
Defeat left Troyes, who had Lossemy Karaboue sent off in the 64th minute, eight points adrift of second-from-bottom Toulouse with a goal difference of -47.
Having confirmed their dominance of the domestic scene, PSG will now attempt to transfer their success onto the Champions League stage.
Blanc's side beat Chelsea 4-2 on aggregate in the last 16 of this season's competition and will find out their quarter-final opponents when the draw takes place in Nyon on Friday.
Pressure is mounting on Blanc and his players to deliver in Europe after the huge investment from the club's wealthy Qatari owners.
But their hopes of becoming a Champions League force in future seasons could depend on their ability to keep Ibrahimovic, 34, and Cavani, who have both been linked with moves to the Premier League.
Sweden legend Ibrahimovic has been touted as a possible Manchester United target, and is out of contract this summer.
