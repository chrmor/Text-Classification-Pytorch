Thailand will support UN statehood bid
BANGKOK (Ma'an) -- Thailand will support the recognition of Palestine as an independent state at the United Nations in September, PLO member Nabil Shaath said Monday.
Shaath met with officials from the Thai foreign ministry in Bangkok and discussed the Palestinian leadership's efforts to be admitted as a full member of the world body.
The PLO official passed on President Mahmoud Abbas' congratulations to the newly-appointed Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
The new Thai government is set to present its policies to parliament this week and the country's foreign ministry has recommended that recognition of an independent Palestinian state should be on the agenda, Shaath said.
A delegation of Palestinian officials led by Shaath met with the Council of Arab ambassadors in Thailand and discussed the Palestinian strategy for statehood.
Shaath said he asked the Kuwaiti ambassador to Thailand for help in securing UK Prime Minister David Cameron's support for the UN campaign.
The delegation will head to India on Tuesday before attending a meeting in Russia to coordinate the UN bid.
