Bombing of Tourist Bus Kills at Least Three in Sinai
CAIRO — At least two South Korean tourists and their Egyptian driver were killed on Sunday when an explosion ripped through a tour bus in a resort town in the Sinai Peninsula, in what officials said was the first deadly attack on tourists by militants in Egypt in at least three years.
The bus, which had been carrying more than 30 people, was parked for a break in Taba, near the border with Israel, when the blast occurred. Officials said they believed an explosive device had been placed in the vehicle, possibly under the driver’s seat. Photographs of the aftermath of the bombing showed heavy damage to the chassis of the yellow bus, which was engulfed by fire after the explosion.
Health and tourism officials said they had confirmed three deaths. A rescue worker quoted by The Associated Press said three bodies had been found, as well as the burned remains of one or possibly two other people. At least 17 other passengers were injured, officials said.
