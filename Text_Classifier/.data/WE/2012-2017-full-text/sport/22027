Always Dreaming wins the 143rd Kentucky Derby
"This is the best horse Todd and I have ever come to the Kentucky Derby with," Velazquez said. "Nothing against all the others, but this was the best horse. I got a good position early and then he relaxed. When we hit the quarter pole, I asked him and he responded. He did it himself from there."
