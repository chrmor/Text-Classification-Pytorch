An Attack at the Israeli Embassy in Jordan
Two people were wounded and one person died Sunday after a shooting  at the Israeli embassy in Jordan’s capital, Amman. There are few details on the incident, and the motive is still under investigation. Police said one of the injured was an Israeli, and the other two victims were Jordanians, one of whom died. Both Jordanians worked for a furniture company  and had entered the embassy’s compound just before the shooting and were working in one of the residential buildings on site.
Israeli authorities evacuated staff at the embassy, which is located in a wealthy neighborhood and is heavily guarded. Israeli authorities are not commenting on the shooting.
Nothing has been confirmed, but the attack could be linked to recent protests over the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The site has been at the heart of mass protests, started after the Israeli government installed metal detectors at the mosque’s entrance. Israel says they’re necessary for protection after three militants earlier this month  attacked and killed two Israeli guards. Muslim leaders see the metal detectors as a challenge to a pact, under which a Muslim organization based in Jordan controls the holy site.
Muslim leaders with the organization, the Waqf, called earlier this week for supporters to boycott the mosque and instead hold prayers outside in the streets. Leaders called for peaceful protest, but in many cases they’ve turned violent. Police and protesters have both clashed in attacks, especially in the West Bank. Early on Friday some protesters threw rocks at police and officers responded by shooting live ammunition into the crowd, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Three people were killed and hundreds were injured. Later Friday evening, the Israeli government said a Palestinian man snuck into a home in the West Bank and killed three Israelis—two men and a woman eating dinner.
