PNG PM steps aside amid political turmoil
Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Michael Somare has announced he will step aside as the country's leader so he can face a leadership tribunal regarding alleged misconduct in office.
Sir Michael sent a press release late on Monday night outlining his plan to "voluntarily step aside" after his lawyers earlier in the day failed to stop the public prosecutor advising the country's Chief Justice to set up a leadership tribunal.
A newly appointed deputy prime minister, Sam Abal, will assume full function and responsibility of the office of the prime minister while Sir Michael attends to clearing his name, the press release states.
"While the supreme court has yet to give the PM an opportunity to be heard on his reference the public prosecutor has proceeded to make a referral.
"The PM respects the due processes and will continue to avail himself to hearings," the press release states.
The PM referred to Monday's court debacle as a "gross injustice" considering the judge in the case went missing and could not be located to hear the matter.
