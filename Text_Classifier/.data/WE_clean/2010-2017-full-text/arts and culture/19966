President Obama reflects on Afghanistan mission in Christmas address
KANEOHE BAY, HAWAII—U.S. President Barack Obama joined and first lady Michelle Obama to wish Americans a “Merry Christmas,” encouraging people to embrace the holiday spirit by reaching out to the sick and hungry.
In his Christmas message, Obama also reflected on the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan, saying the holiday season is also a time to honour U.S. troops and their families.
“In just a few days our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. Our longest war will come to a responsible end,” Obama said. “And that gives us an opportunity to step back and reflect upon all that these families have given us.”
“And so, as our troops continue to transition back home, back to our businesses, our schools, our congregations and our communities, it’s up to all of us to serve them as well as they’ve served us,” said Michelle Obama.
