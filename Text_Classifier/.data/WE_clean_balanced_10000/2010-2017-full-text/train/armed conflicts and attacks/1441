BEIRUT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.N. children's fund UNICEF on Friday confirmed cases of severe malnutrition among children in the besieged Syrian town of Madaya, where aid was delivered this week to thousands of people affected by the months-long blockade.
"UNICEF ... can confirm that cases of severe malnutrition were found among children," it said in a statement. Its staff also witnessed the death of a severely malnourished 16-year-old boy, it said. (Reporting by John Davison; Editing by Alison Williams)
