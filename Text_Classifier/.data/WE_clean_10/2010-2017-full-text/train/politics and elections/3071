Right-Left Government Takes Office
Taavi Rõivas's Reform Party and Social Democrat coalition has been sworn in as the new government of Estonia.
Rõivas, 34, was only promoted to a ministerial position 13 months ago, but received his party's blessings after EU Commissioner Siim Kallas dropped his ambition to return to the prime minister's seat a few weeks ago, citing media criticism.
The last hurdle was cleared this morning when Rõivas and his cabinet met President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who gave his approval.
“Each individual in Estonia matters. It is important for Estonia that each person living here copes with life and no one feels left behind,” Ilves said, adding the three pillars of success for Estonia are security, education and health. Ilves, himself a member of the Social Democrats before entering his current office, said those principles resonate in the new government's plans.
Rõivas's Cabinet's mandate will last until a new government is assembled after the next parliamentary elections in eleven months.
The new Cabinet's lineup is:
Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas, Reform Party Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet, 39, Reform Party Minister of the Interior Hanno Pevkur, 36, Reform Party Minister of Defense Sven Mikser, 40, Social Democrats Minister of Education and Research Jevgeni Ossinovski, 28, Social Democrats Minister of Justice Andres Anvelt, 44, Social Democrats Minister of Environment Keit Pentus-Rosimannus, 38, Reform Party Minister of Culture Urve Tiidus, 59, Reform Party Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Urve Palo, 41, Social Democrats Minister of Foreign Trade and Entrepreneurship Anne Sulling, 37, joining the Reform Party Minister of Agriculture Ivari Padar, 49, Social Democrats Minister of Finance Jürgen Ligi, 54, Reform Party Minister of Health and Labor Urmas Kruuse, 48, Reform Party Minister of Social Welfare Helmen Kütt, 52
