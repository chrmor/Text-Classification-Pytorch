At least 10 die in Georgia floods; deadly zoo animals roam streets
Lions, tigers, bears and other wild animals escaped from a zoo in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Sunday, adding to chaos caused by flooding that killed at least 10 people, officials said.
Police and soldiers were hunting down the animals, recapturing some and shooting others dead, while rescuers airlifted scores of people trapped by the floods.
Portions of the city's zoo were destroyed, allowing more than 30 animals - including wolves, tigers, lions and bears - to break free of their enclosures and roam the streets.
Police shot dead several animals over safety concerns, with six wolves killed at a children's hospital, broadcaster Rustavi 2 reported.
