Clashes in Indian Kashmir Kill at Least 7
A third straight day of clashes between security forces and pro-independence protesters in Indian Kashmir killed at least seven people Sunday. Three people died in the town of Pampore, south of Srinagar, when security forces opened fire to quell a violent protest by a large crowd. In the nearby village of Khrew, four people were killed and more than 30 wounded in a series of blasts after angry protesters set fire to a police stations stored with explosives. Most of the building was destroyed in the attack. Two people were killed Saturday after police in two towns opened fire on protesters who attacked their camps. At least 25 people have been killed by Indian security forces in Kashmir in almost daily protests since the June shooting death of a 17-year-old. Authorities have tried to quell the violence by imposing on-and-off curfews across the Kashmir valley. Muslim separatists in Kashmir have been fighting for independence from India or a merger with Muslim-majority Pakistan for more than 20 years. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict. Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, but claimed in its entirety by both. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have fought two wars over the Himalayan region.
