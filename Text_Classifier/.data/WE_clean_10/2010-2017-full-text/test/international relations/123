Thousands of migrants enter Croatia, president readies army to respond
Zagreb: Croatia lost control of its border with Serbia on Thursday, unable to deny the sheer force of will of thousands of asylum seekers pressing west and north into Europe, and unable to cope with their needs or numbers.
The country put its army on alert in response, with Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic saying they would "protect the national borders from the illegal migration" â€“ setting up a potentially dangerous stand-off once they are deployed.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said earlier on Thursday that Croatia could not receive more migrants. More than 7000 refugees have arrived since Wednesday, police said, with many more expected now Hungary has closed its border.
There were chaotic, angry scenes in the tiny Croatian border town of Tovarnik, as police tried to keep the massing refugees contained behind a fence. Children screamed in the crush, and men, women and children fainted in the 35-degree Celsius heat.
