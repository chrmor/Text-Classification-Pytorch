Bollywood veteran film-maker Yash Chopra dies
One of India's most influential film-makers, Yash Chopra, has died from dengue fever in Mumbai, aged 80.
Over five decades, Chopra, dubbed the King of Romance, gave Bollywood some of its biggest blockbusters.
His film studios Yash Raj Films helped establish some of Indian cinema's biggest names, including Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.
In his tribute, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Chopra as an "icon of Indian cinema".
Yash Chopra will be remembered as the man behind some of Bollywood's most watched films, known not just in India but around the world, says the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Mumbai.
Chopra died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital on Sunday and was also suffering kidney ailments, according to Dr Prakash Jiyavani.
"It is sad news that Yash is no more among us," close family friend Amit Khanna, chairman of Reliance Big Entertainment, told AFP news agency.
Singer Lata Mangeshkar said: "He made me sing in all his films. He was a jovial person... Even when he was angry, he simply kept quiet."
In his tribute, Prime Minister Singh said Chopra had entertained many generations "with his rare creativity".
"His flourish to essay romance and social drama was unmatched," the prime minister said, adding that the filmmaker had established the international reputation of Indian cinema.
Yash Chopra started his film career working for his brother before establishing Yash Raj Films and going on to produce more than 40 movies - 22 of them as director.
Chopra was behind major hits including Deewar (Wall), Dil To Pagal Hai (Heart Is Mad) and Chandni (Moonlight).
On his birthday last month, he said Jab Tak Hai Jaan (Till I am Alive) - being released next month - would be his last movie as a director.
