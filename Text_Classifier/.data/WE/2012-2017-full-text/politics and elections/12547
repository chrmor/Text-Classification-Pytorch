Russia Calls Together UNSC Meeting on Humanitarian Situation in Yemen
In response to the humanitarian situation in Yemen, Russia plans to convene a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Russia will convene an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the humanitarian situation in Yemen amid the Saudi-led international military operation against Houthis, Russia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations said Friday.
"Russia convenes UN Security Council consultations to discuss the establishment of a regular and mandatory 'humanitarian pause' amid ongoing coalition airstrikes on Yemen," the mission's spokesman, Alexey Zaytsev, told RIA Novosti.
An extraordinary meeting is scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m. (15:00 GMT.)
The international coalition airstrikes target Houthi positions located in or near residential areas and as a result numerous people, including civilians, are being killed and wounded by the coalition attacks.
Houthi militants have recently taken control of the Yemeni capital Sanaa, forcing elected president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to flee the country. The militants are currently gaining foothold across the country.
