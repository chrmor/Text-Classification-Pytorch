Four Yemeni soldiers killed near al Qaeda-held city
ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Four Yemeni soldiers were killed and dozens injured in what appeared to be an ambush as they were traveling to the al Qaeda-held city of Zinjibar, a security official said.
The official did not know who was responsible for the attack.
Several hundred al Qaeda and Islamist militants took control of the southern coastal city a few days ago and have been battling locals and government soldiers since the weekend who are trying to regain control.
