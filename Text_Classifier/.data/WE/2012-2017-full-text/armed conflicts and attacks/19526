Pregnant Davao bombing victim dies in hospital; death toll rises to 15
Davao City (CNN Philippines) — The death toll of the Davao City Night Market bombing on September 2 has risen to 15, following the death of a pregnant woman Monday evening.
Vicenta Asperin died at the Metro Davao Medical and Research Center (MDMRC) at around 10:17 p.m. Monday — 11 days after she went into a coma. She sustained severe head injuries from the blast.
Asperin was 21 years old and six months pregnant. Her unborn child also died. 
The City Social Services and Development Office, quoting a medical report, said Asperin passed away from heart failure and brain damage.
The bomb exploded near a massage parlor where Asperin was working. She sustained very severe shrapnel wounds in her head. A few minutes before her dying breath, she was declared brain-dead by her attending physician.
Asperin was the massage therapist of a 12-year old victim, who was among those who died on the spot.
According to CSSDO chief Ma. Luisa Bermudo, the deaths of Asperin and her unborn child should be counted as one. Bermudo explained, this is because the mother and child were not separated, as the unborn baby remained inside the mother's womb.
