The Eiffel Tower and the surrounding Champ de Mars park were briefly evacuated overnight because of a bomb alert, the fourth in the Paris region in as many weeks, but a search turned up nothing, police said.
Police said the decision to evacuate came after the fire service received a call from a public telephone saying there was a suspect package at the tower.
It was also the second evacuation of the Eiffel Tower and Champ de Mars due to a bomb alert - which also failed to turn up any explosives - in two weeks.
French security officials said last week the country was on heightened alert after receiving a tip-off of a planned suicide attack on the Paris metro.
Interior minister Brice Hortefeux said on September 20 France faced a real terrorism threat due to a backlash from Al Qaeda militants in North Africa, with fears growing of an attack from home-grown cells within French borders.
