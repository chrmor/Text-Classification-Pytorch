Gadhafi, in surprise appearance, urges loyalists to defend Libya

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in an unexpected appearance before supporters gathered at Tripoli's Green Square today, called on young Libyans to fight.
"I am among the public," he says, shaking his right fist. "We will continue to fight. We will defeat them. We will die here on the dear soil of Libya."
Flanked by bodyguards, Gadhafi stood atop a wall on one side of the square and spoke into a handheld microphone. His remarks were carried by Libya state TV.
Addressing the young crowd below, he shouted, "We can defeat any aggression if necessary and arm the people.
"We will defeat any foreign attempt as we defeated the former Italian imperialism. This is the formidable force, the invincible face of youth."
He called on young people to "stay up all night, live a life of dignity, with high morals."
"Dance and sing, joy and rejoice," Gadhafi said, throwing a kiss to the crowd before ending his remarks and turning away.
