Syrian troops kill 58 IS militants
Damascus: Syrian troops killed 58 militants associated with the Islamic State (IS) group in the country's eastern province of Deir al-Zour, a media report said.
The Syrian forces killed the IS militants who were trying to attack an air base in the countryside of Deir al-Zour on Sunday, Xinhua reported citing SANA news agency.
The army forces also killed tens of IS militants in the towns of Nasib Daghim, Zira', and Hwaijet Muraiyeh in Deir al-Zour, near the Iraqi borders, according to SANA news agency.
The IS, which is in control of large swathes of the oil-rich Deir al-Zour, has repeatedly attempted to storm the Deir al-Zour airbase, as it is considered as a main bastion for the Syrian army.
Last September, the IS said that its militants had captured a missile battalion near the Deir al-Zour airbase killing 90 Syrian soldiers and officers.Â
