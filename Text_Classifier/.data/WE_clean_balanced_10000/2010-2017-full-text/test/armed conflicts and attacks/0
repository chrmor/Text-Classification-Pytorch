50,000 political prisoners missing in Libya
TONY EASTLEY: In Libya there are concerns that up to 50,000 political prisoners are either trapped in underground jails or they've been executed by elements of the crumbling Gaddafi regime.
The National Transitional Council says it has also freed around 10,000 political prisoners, but one hidden bunker has turned up the charred bodies of prisoners allegedly killed by retreating Gaddafi loyalists.
Our correspondent Michael Vincent is in Benghazi.
Rebel spokesman Shamsaddin Ben-Ali has been telling Michael Vincent he holds grave fears for those political prisoners still missing.
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: Yesterday the same brigade that has control of the airport has been searching- you know, soldiers have been searching inch by inch the entire road from the outskirts of Tripoli to the airport. There is a lot of farmland there and they have been searching everywhere because apparently there are some hidden bunkers.
MICHAEL VINCENT: Fifty thousand people is a hell of a lot of people.
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: Yeah, 50,000 is what we estimate.
MICHAEL VINCENT: How did you come to the accurate figures of 50,000?
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: This has been a slow progress over several months that has just slowly been building up, building up. It started, you know, in the early days of the lockdown of Tripoli and the infitada of Bin Ashur and Fashloom and Sogorsuman (phonetic), Tusura (phonetic) areas, you know, we were hearing 5,000, then 6,000 and then 7,000 and just over the months it has ...
MICHAEL VINCENT: Has someone like the ICRC been able to confirm this or not?
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: I'm sure they are active in trying to. They have even, the head of the council mentioned the figure and he has received these reports from one of the prisons that was located. They found some of the rooms which hold bodies by the dozens.
MICHAEL VINCENT: It is not possible these people could have fled Tripoli and gone overseas or got out of the country? It's no...
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: No, no, no, these were people who - and you will hear it in the days to come. There is just thousands still reporting loved ones missing.
So now the main prisons that have been unlocked, several of the prisons that are well known, they broke into them, they released the prisoners but that's it. Where are the rest?
You know, we know that the total number of these prisoners that have been released are estimated around 10,000, 11,000 but where is the rest of them? There is thousands still missing.
I mean, you can say maybe some were killed but our biggest fear is those that are killed, that is, you know, sad but what about the ones who may be still alive>
Right now Tripoli, Bab Azizia. There is Salahadin -other military compounds. We don't know where they are all are, where they incarcerated all these civilians who have been arrested. These guys have not received water or food now for six days, seven days since the liberation of Tripoli.
Who has been taking care of them if they are there?
MICHAEL VINCENT: You're saying there is already a humanitarian crisis in Tripoli and yet if you find 50,000 people...
SHAMSADDIN BEN-ALI: It will expound that. It already has. The number of injured who are coming in from the battle fields, the number of people who had been injured during battles over the past months were not able to take their injured out of their homes and take them to the hospitals for fear that they would be killed.
So there was a lot of injured inside Tripoli who had been kept in their homes for fear that if they were to take them to any hospital in Tripoli, they would be killed. So we got those, we got all the people who had been tortured and malnourished in these prisons, they will now add to that difficulty.
