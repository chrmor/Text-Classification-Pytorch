Explosion in eastern Afghanistan kills 9 civilians
A bomb explosion in Afghanistan's Laghman province killed nine passengers traveling on a civilian bus, the Afghan president's office said Saturday in a statement.
A woman and a child were among the victims in the explosion which took place in the Alingar district Saturday morning, the statement said. The province is in eastern Afghanistan, where fighting has raged for years during the war.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned what he called a terrorist act and said that the bomb had been planted by the enemies of Afghan people, according to the statement.
Gen. John R. Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, called the strike a "sad example of the insurgency's absolute lack of respect for civilian life." He urged Taliban leader Mullah Omar to stop and condemn "these despicable acts."
"Apparently, the Taliban do not care about the Afghan people," Allen said. "Their leaders have lost control over their fighters, which is particularly troubling at this sacred time of year. If specific guidance given during the holy period of Eid doesn't stop insurgents from killing civilians, then what will?"
