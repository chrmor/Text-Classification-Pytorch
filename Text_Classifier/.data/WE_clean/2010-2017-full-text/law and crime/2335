The leader of a terrorist organisation that plotted to wage violent jihad in Australia has failed to have his sentence reduced, despite a partial win in the Court of Appeal.
Abdul Nacer Benbrika was sentenced to 15 years in jail with a non-parole period of 12 years for directing a terrorist organisation.
Six of his followers received minimum sentences between four-and-a-half and 10 years for belonging to the home-grown terrorist cell.
Today, the Court of Appeal dismissed appeals against all seven convictions on those counts.
However, the judges ruled the sentences handed down to the group for belonging to the cell were excessive and ought to take into account the history and nature of the organisation.
"A terrorist organisation may include anything from a ragtag collection of malcontents whose commitment to terror never advances further than a conception," the court said.
"On the other hand, it may include a terrorist organisation, like Al Qaeda or Jemaah Islamiah, with a proven record of committing the worst terrorist acts imaginable."
The court also ruled the offending often overlapped.
"Adjustment of sentences was necessary to ensure that the offender was not doubly punished for the same conduct," the court said.
Benbrika's sentence for membership of the terrorist cell he ran was reduced to seven years, but his overall sentence of 15 years, with a minimum of 12, remains.
Ahmed Raad, Amer Haddara, Abdullah Merhu, Aimen Joud all had their sentences reduced by two years; Ezzit Raad was resentenced to six years; Fadel Sayadi to seven years.
Convictions against Benbrika and Joud for lesser charges of possessing CDs connected with the preparation of a terrorist act have been quashed.
Joud has been acquitted on those counts, and Benbrika has been granted a retrial.
