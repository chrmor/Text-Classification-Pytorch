Nepal Maoists split, Baidya to head new faction
Nepal's Maoists have split, creating further political uncertainty in the Himalayan nation and continuing challenge for Indian policy in the neighbourhood. Mohan Baidya Kiran, leading the faction of extreme left-wing members of Nepal's Communist Party (Maoist) quit the party with his supporters on Monday, effectively splitting the party. He and his group have demanded the removal of Prachanda as party chairman and Baburam Bhattarai as prime minister. Incidentally, Bhattarai is out of the country, representing Nepal at the Rio+20 summit in Brazil. Manmohan Singh is expected to meet Bhattarai there but it's not yet clear whether Bhattarai will stay on given the events unfolding in Nepal. Baidya had been opposed to a multi-party system, preferring a "peoples democracy" instead. The hardline faction had put forward a set of demands which included stepping down by Party chief Prachanda. Baidya has threatened to go back for another "revolution" and has opposed the disarming of Maoist cadres by the UN and integration into the Nepal army. Baidya has also been a strong opponent of better ties with India and has bitterly criticised the India-Nepal Bilateral investment promotion and protection treaty (BIPA). Baidya has promised to register the new party on Tuesday, to be called Communist Party Revolutionary Maoist. This agreement could not be signed during Bhattarai's recent visit to India.
