Protesters who have been holding a Bolivian city hostage for 10 days have now cut off the rail line to Chile and started a hunger strike.
The 6,000 protesters have blocked the only roads in and out of Potosi, a city of 160,000 that lies up in the Andes.
They accuse Bolivian president Evo Morales of ignoring the many poor people in the city and want increased regional investment, including construction of a new cement factory and a larger airport.
The city has been cut off from the rest of the country by roadblocks made of piled-up boulders on its main access routes.
The governor of the district is one those participating in the hunger strike.
There are more than 100 foreign tourists still trapped in the city.
There were reports they had been threatened and that one of the protest leaders said protesters would blow up any bus that tried to leave the city.
So far the Bolivian government has not acted to resolve the dispute.
