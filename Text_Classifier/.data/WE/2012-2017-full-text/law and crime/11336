Egypt jails 78 teenagers for taking part in protests supporting ousted president Mohammed Mursi
Cairo: An Egyptian court has sentenced 78 minors to between two and five years in prison for taking part in demonstrations calling for the return of ousted president Mohammed Mursi.
The authorities have engaged in a crackdown on Dr Mursi's supporters since his overthrow by the army last year, with hundreds jailed in mass trials which the United Nations has described as "unprecedented in recent history".
On Wednesday, a court in the city of Alexandria sentenced 78 teenage boys aged from 13 to 17 for joining Muslim Brotherhood rallies during the past three months, a judicial official said.
"The 78 minors, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, were arrested for participating in protests organised by the group calling for the downfall of the regime where they blocked roads and transportation, and frightened citizens," state news agency MENA reported.
At the same time, an Egyptian committee investigating political violence made a rare break with judicial support for heavy-handed state tactics, recommending the government should amend a law restricting protest.
