Israeli car stoned in West Bank; girl injured
A 12-year-old girl riding in a car driving through Tapuach Junction in the West Bank was mildly wounded Thursday, after the car was stoned by Palestinians.
This is the third West Bank attack in three days, just as Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were getting underway in Washington. Security forces began canvassing the area immediately in search of suspects.
Magen David Adom emergency services paramedics were immediately dispatched to the scene and treated the girl on site. She was rushed to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva.
Earlier, an Israeli man driving between Shilo and Ofra in the West Bank reported he was fired upon. security forces investigating the report discovered that it was fireworks, rather than gunshots, which the man heard.
On Tuesday, four Israelis were killed after their vehicle was ambushed by Palestinian terrorists, who confirmed the victims' death from close range. A day later, two Israelis were wounded in a similar shooting attack. In that case, an apparent rifle malfunction allowed the victims to get out of their car and escape death, seeking refuge at a nearby wadi.
