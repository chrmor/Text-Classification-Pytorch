Terror leader Abu Bakar Bashir found guilty
Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir has been found guilty of inciting terrorism and financing an Aceh-based terrorist cell and sentenced to 15 years in prison, ending a decade-long effort by authorities to put the firebrand militant who endorsed the Bali bombings behind bars.
Hundreds of Bashir's supporters, who chanted "God is great" as judges spent hours reading through a summary of evidence, erupted in jeers when the verdict was read out.
Bashir was convicted for arranging the financing of a terrorist cell uncovered in the Indonesian province of Aceh last year, a new grouping that included a who's who of the remnants of the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah and other assorted militants.
Prosecutors said Bashir was the "emir" of figurehead of the group, and had held at least one planning meeting with Dulmatin, a senior figure in the Bali bombings that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence.
