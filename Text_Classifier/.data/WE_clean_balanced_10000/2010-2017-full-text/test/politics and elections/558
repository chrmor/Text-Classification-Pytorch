US debt deal wins approval in House of Representatives
The House chamber broke into a sudden standing ovation in the midst of voting as word spread that Ms Giffords had entered. Fellow lawmakers embraced her as Ms Giffords blew kisses and could be seen saying, "Thank you, thank you." Ms Giffords, while thin and missing her once long locks of blonde hair, appeared to be in surprisingly good health, moving through the chamber with minimal assistance from an aide. In a statement, she said she "had to be here for this vote" and "could not take the chance that my absence could crash our economy". "I have closely followed the debate over our debt ceiling and have been deeply disappointed at what's going on in Washington. After weeks of failed debate in Washington, I was pleased to see a solution to this crisis emerge." Financial markets worldwide have been rattled by uncertainty over whether the compromise plan could pass the House in the face of objections from conservative Tea Party Republicans and from liberal Democrats.
Having a deal in place by Tuesday to raise the US government's $US14.3 trillion borrowing limit will remove the risk of the United States not being able to borrow money to pay all of its bills. A debt default by the world's largest economy would send shockwaves through the international economic system. In the hours leading up to the House vote, Republican and Democratic leaders worked furiously to sell their rank-and-file on a deal reached with President Barack Obama in a bid to end an acrimonious impasse that has undermined Americans' faith in their political institutions and hurt America's image abroad. But fears remained that the United States could still be hit by a damaging credit ratings downgrade, which would raise US borrowing costs, threatening a fragile economic recovery and rattling global investors. The compromise plan calls for spending cuts over 10 years but no new taxes and creates a powerful new congressional committee to recommend a deficit-reduction package by late November.
It was hard to identify winners in a bitter fight that appeared to be finally winding towards a conclusion after Sunday's compromise agreement. Mr Obama had to accept deeper spending cuts than he wanted and will have to defend them to his liberal base during his campaign for re-election in 2012, but he could win points with moderates and independents he needs to win a second term. The Republicans got the cuts they demanded without immediate tax increases, but had to fight an image of being inflexible and a captive of the partyâ€™s Tea Party wing. Americans anxious to reduce the country's 9.2 per cent jobless rate became increasingly frustrated as the debate raged on through the northern hemisphere summer.
Here are details of the plan, as released by the White House, the House Rules Committee and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office: The package immediately authorises spending cuts of $US917 billion between 2012 and 2021. The cuts would be in the form of caps on discretionary spending - funding that is authorised at will by Congress - and not from entitlements such as Social Security and the Medicare health care program for the elderly. The package sets up a special committee in Congress - to be evenly divided between members of Mr Obama's Democratic Party and House Speaker John Boehner's Republican Party - that would find $US1.5 trillion in further cuts from all areas.
The committee is required to come up with proposals by November 23. Both the House of Representatives and Senate would then vote on those proposals by December 23, in up-or-down decisions in which lawmakers would not be able to make amendments. If the committee process fails, then cuts of $US1.2 trillion would automatically come into force - divided evenly between military and non-military spending, but not touching Medicare and Social Security. The Congressional Budget Office said that the total package would result in at least $US2.1 trillion in deficit reduction by 2021 compared with March 2011. * THE DEBT CEILING The deal authorises an increase in the debt limit by between $US2.1 and $US2.4 trillion. The United States hit its current ceiling of $US14.3 trillion on May 16 and will start running short of cash at midnight Tuesday (2pm AEST on Wednesday). The rise would cover the US debt until the start of 2013 - a key goal for Mr Obama who wants to avoid a similar showdown with Congress during his re-election bid next year. The increase would come in two parts, starting with an immediate hike by $900 billion. If Congress cuts spending through the special committee, the ceiling would then go up by another $US1.5 trillion; otherwise it would rise by $US1.2 trillion as part of automatic spending cuts. * DEFENCE SPENDING The package would cut $US350 billion in defence spending over the next 10 years as part of the first batch of cuts. The special committee would look at further cuts. The US military budget last year was about $US700 billion, by far the largest in the world, but the figure is certain to come down as the United States winds down commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some Republicans have argued against steep defence cuts, saying there is insufficient thought on the strategic implications. Republicans have vowed to resist steep defence cuts in the special committee. The White House hopes the threat of the automatic cuts if the committee fails - which would amount to $US600 billion - would serve as leverage to press Republicans on the panel. * TAXES The package would not increase taxes, a key demand of Republicans. Liberal Democrats have been strongly critical, saying that the United States should not consider major spending cuts at a time of a weak economy without also raising revenue. The White House said that Mr Obama could still fight to restore tax rates on wealthy Americans - bringing in nearly $US1 trillion in revenue. Mr Obama's Republican predecessor George Bush lowered the taxes on the wealthy but the cuts are set to expire at the end of 2012. Democrats have also said that the special committee could propose to raise revenue by cutting subsidies to the oil and gas industries, but Republicans have rejected the idea. * CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT The package calls for Congress to vote by the end of the year on an amendment to the US Constitution that requires a balanced budget, a longstanding proposal of conservative Republicans who say the country must keep its finances in order. If Congress approves the amendment, Mr Obama would be authorised to seek another $US1.5 trillion rise in the debt ceiling. Many Democrats argue that the amendment is a gimmick that would not make sense in a future crisis. Amending the founding US document is an arduous process, requiring two-thirds votes by both the House of Representatives and Senate and ratification from legislatures of at least 38 of the 50 states. * EDUCATION
