Coach Gigi Delneri sacked by Genoa after defeat
Gigi Delneri has been sacked as coach of Genoa following the club's 2-0 defeat at home to fellow strugglers Cagliari on Sunday.
Delneri, 62, has led the Grifone to just two wins in his 13 matches in charge following his appointment in October. The result, their ninth loss under his guidance, leaves them three points adrift of safety and president Enrico Preziosi decided to make yet another change.
He has appointed Davide Ballardini as Delneri's replacement, making him the fourth coach at the club since the end of last season following the earlier sackings of Alberto Malesani and Luigi Di Canio.
Preziosi has made 15 coaching changes since taking control of the club in 2003 despite a four year stint for Gian Piero Gasperini during that time and that instability is often cited as the root of their on field problems.
Ballardini is expected to be presented to the media at a press conference on Monday and faces a tough start to his latest spell on the bench with matches against Juventus and Lazio next on the fixture list.
