Gabon's president says he won't let the Central African nation descend into chaos following violent clashes between police and demonstrators who back a recently returned opposition leader.
President Ali Bongo went on national television Thursday, saying he would not leave the country in the hands of those who “want to break and destroy Gabon.”
Opposition leader Andre Mba Obame, who recently returned from self-imposed exile, was accused of treason after he declared himself president after the 2009 election though he placed third in official results. Employees at his private television station say men stormed the TV+ headquarters on Wednesday after the protest and shut down their broadcast. The opposition says one person was killed during the rally that turned violent. The government maintains no one was killed. - Sapa-AP
