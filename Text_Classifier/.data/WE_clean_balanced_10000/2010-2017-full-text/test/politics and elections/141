Paul Ryan easily wins reelection as speaker of the House
House Republicans overwhelmingly reelected Paul Ryan on Tuesday to another term as speaker of the House. Only one — Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — voted against him.
It’s the first full term for Ryan, who took the gavel from his predecessor John Boehner in late 2015. And the near-unanimous support of the Republican caucus is a symbolic milestone for a House GOP that has long been bitterly divided along ideological lines. But the election of Donald Trump, who at times has feuded with Ryan, undercut a band of hardline conservatives strategizing to replace him.
Ryan will take control of a slightly smaller Republican caucus — Democrats netted six seats in the November elections — but one still firmly in control of the chamber, holding a 241- to 194-seat edge.
Massie, the lone anti-Ryan vote, cast his ballot for Florida Republican Daniel Webster.
On the other side of the aisle, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi saw four defections in her own caucus: Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) voted for fellow Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan, and Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wisc.) voted for Cooper. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-New York) also voted for Tim Ryan, and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) voted for Rep. John Lewis.
Paul Ryan will begin his term helping the incoming Trump administration shepherd through its early priorities. He spent the day ahead of the speakership vote defusing a controversy over a late Monday decision by House Republicans to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics. Amid pressure from Ryan, Trump and a public backlash, House Republicans agreed to pull their proposal and consider it later in the year.
