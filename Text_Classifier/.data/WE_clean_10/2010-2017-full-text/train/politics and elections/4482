Yemen’s National Salvation Government was sworn in on Tuesday in Sanaa after the supreme political council had approved the formation of the 42-member cabinet headed by Abdol Aziz bin Habtur.
Habtur stated that the cabinet will exert all the possible efforts to meet the Yemenis’ aspirations as the political council had stressed that the main mission of the new government is to organize the domestic conditions and to confront the Saudi aggression militarily, politically and economically.
Yemen has been since March 26, 2015 under brutal aggression by Saudi-led coalition.
Thousands have been martyred and injured in the attack, with the vast majority of them are civilians.
Riyadh launched the attack on Yemen in a bid to restore power to fugitive ex-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi who is a close ally to Saudi Arabia.
