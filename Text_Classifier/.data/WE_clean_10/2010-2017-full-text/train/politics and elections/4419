Trump’s 2nd Nominee for Army Secretary Withdraws
WASHINGTON — Mark E. Green, President Trump’s second nominee to be secretary of the Army, withdrew from consideration on Friday, saying in a statement that his nomination had become a distraction because of “false and misleading attacks against me.”
Mr. Green, a Tennessee state senator who was an Army flight surgeon, has criticizedfederal attempts to bar discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender people in workplaces and businesses.
“Tragically, my life of public service and my Christian beliefs have been mischaracterized and attacked by a few on the other side of the aisle for political gain,” Mr. Green said in the statement. “While these false attacks have no bearing on the needs of the Army or my qualifications to serve, I believe it is critical to give the president the ability to move forward with his vision to restore our military to its rightful place in the world.”
Mr. Trump’s first pick for Army secretary, Vincent Viola, pulled out of consideration in February, saying he could not disentangle himself from his business ties. Mr. Viola is the owner of the N.H.L.’s Florida Panthers.
