U.S. Government Agency Declares Hoverboards Unsafe
Never mind that the things don’t actually hover. The CPSC is putting hoverboard manufacturers, importers and retailers on notice: meet safety standards or face recall or seizure at ports.
“Consumers risk serious injury or death if their self-balancing scooters ignite and burn,” the government agency said in an official letter it sent out issuing a new set of safety standards for the gliding gadgets.
Hoverboards have been prone to defects, including but not limited to: catching fire while in motion and burning down entire houses.
The CPSC’s letter states that the agency “considers self-balancing scooters that do not meet the safety standards referenced above to be defective, and that they may present a substantial product hazard … or could be determined to be an imminent hazard.”
