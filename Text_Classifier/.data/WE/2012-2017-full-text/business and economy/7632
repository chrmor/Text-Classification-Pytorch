Alcoa, H-P and Bank of America to Be Dropped from the Dow Jones
Alcoa Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Bank of America Corp. will be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average next week, in the biggest shake-up of the 30-stock index in almost a decade.
Alcoa, a Dow component for 54 years, will be replaced by athletic-gear maker Nike Inc. Payments company Visa Inc. will replace H-P, which joined the index in 1997, and securities firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will supplant Bank of America, which spent five years in the blue-chip benchmark.
