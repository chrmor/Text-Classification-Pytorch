106 missing after Congo boat capsizes
At least 106 people are missing after a boat capsized on a river in Congo, according to a witness.
Another boat capsized on that same river last year, leaving as many as 200 people dead.
Congo is a vast country of jungles and huge rivers in Central Africa with few paved roads. Many people prefer to take boats even if they do not know how to swim.
The boats are often in poor repair and filled beyond capacity, and the industry is not well-regulated.
