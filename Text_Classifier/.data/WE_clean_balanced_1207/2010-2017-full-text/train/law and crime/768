Memorial honors victims in California college shooting as police search for gun
Goh took the secretary into the classroom, but when he realized the administrator was not there, he shot her and ordered the students to line up against the wall. Not all of them cooperated, Jordan said, and so he began shooting.
"No American mayor wants to have this situation," she said. "It seems over the last decade, we've gotten used to seeing senseless mass killings like this, and we'll have to question the availability of guns and the need for other services in our community."
Then, he said, a woman emerged from bushes and told him she had been shot. "I was kind of mind-boggled," he said, but the woman showed him her arm. "She had a good little piece, a chunk of her arm, missing."
Civic and church leaders will try to come up with a community strategy to deal with the tragedy, she said. But she stressed the importance of not stigmatizing Koreans or Asians.
"This is all new to us. We don't want to stigmatize whatever the issue is. ... We need to identify the issues first," she said.
