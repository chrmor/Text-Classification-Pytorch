Landslides in North Korea kill 10, others missing
PHYONGAN PROVINCE, North Korea, July 26 (UPI) -- Torrential rain in North Korea triggered landslides that left 10 dead, 55 injured, and four missing, the Korean Central News Agency said.
"Torrential rain pounded North Phyongan Province over the weekend, triggering landslides that left significant damage to residents and properties in the area," KCNA said Monday.
Roads and bridges were also damaged in the slide, which occurred in the mountainous region of the Korean Peninsula.
In an effort to prevent damage from flooding and landslides in the region, the North Korean government has planted nearly 2 million trees to help stabilize the ground, which is primarily used for agriculture.
