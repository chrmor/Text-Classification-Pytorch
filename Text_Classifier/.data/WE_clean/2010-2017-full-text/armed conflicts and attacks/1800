10 killed in Iraq violence, including journalist
Tahrir Kadhim Jawad, a cameraman for the Al Hurra satellite channel, was killed when a magnetic ‘sticky bomb’ attached to his car detonated in the town of Garma, 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of the capital, police in nearby Fallujah said.
International press watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned Jawad’s killing, calling for ‘urgent protection to be provided for the countryâ€™s journalists and... (for) authorities to speed up the conclusions of the investigation.’
RSF said last month that the Iraq conflict has been the deadliest for the media since World War II, and in October 2009 ranked Iraq a lowly 145th place for media freedom out of 175 countries.
According to the ‘Impunity Index’ released in April by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, Iraq has the worst record of any country for solving the murders of reporters.
Also on Monday, a convoy transporting Fuad Al Mussawi, a deputy minister of science and technology, struck a bomb along a road in the upscale neighbourhood of Jadriyah, in the centre of the capital.
The minister was unharmed, but the early morning blast killed one of his guards and wounded four other people, said an interior ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Also in central Baghdad, an employee of a telephone exchange was killed and another wounded by a bomb which detonated near Al Alwiyah communications centre in Karrada.
And on Palestine street, two people were killed in an attempted robbery on a jewellery store. Southwest of Baghdad in the town of Jurf Al Sakhr, an anti-Qaeda militiaman was killed by gunmen, police said.
Monday’s deadliest attack occurred in Diyala province, north of the capital, when a bombing killed three people in the ethnically mixed town of Jalawlah, in a tract of disputed land claimed both by the autonomous Kurdistan region and the central government.
An initial ‘sticky bomb’ attached to a car, which appeared to be targeting Kurdish peshmerga security forces, detonated but did not cause any casualties, Diyala operations command said.
When police arrived at the scene, a second bomb detonated, killing two policemen and a civilian, and wounding 18 others, including 11 police officers.
Also north of the capital in the ethnically divided city of Kirkuk, a bomb attack against the headquarters of the National Turkmen Party killed one person and wounded another, local police said.
