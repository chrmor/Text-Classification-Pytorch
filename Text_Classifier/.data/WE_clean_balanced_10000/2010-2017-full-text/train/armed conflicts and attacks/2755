Deaths in Afghan roadside blast
A roadside bomb destroyed a car carrying nine people to a wedding in northeastern Afghanistan, killing everyone inside including one child.
Six women and two men were the other victims of the blast in Baghlan province, north of Kabul, Abdul Majid, the provincial governor, said on Sunday.
Last week, three policemen were killed in a suicide bombing in the southern Kandahar province.
Earlier this month, at least 16 civilians and a police commander were killed in an attack in a public bathhouse in the Spin Boldak area, near the Pakistan border.
Violence across Afghanistan is at its worst since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban government, with violence spreading rapidly in previously peaceful areas like the north and civilian and military casualties at record levels.
The attacks come after the end of the bloodiest year of a war that has now dragged on for more than nine years.
The United Nations has said 2,412 civilians were killed and 3,803 wounded between January and October last year, a 20 per cent increase from 2009.
