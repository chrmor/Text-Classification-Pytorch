Deadly shooting at bar in western Japan
At least two people have been killed and two others injured when a gunman opened fire at a bar in western Japan, officials say.
They say the incident happened at Habikino, in Osaka Prefecture.
The attacker reportedly turned the gun on himself after the shooting. It was not immediately known if he was one of the two casualties.
Police are investigating the gunman's motive. Shootings are rare in Japan, where there are tough gun control laws.
Such attacks are often linked to gangsters known in Japan as yakuza.
