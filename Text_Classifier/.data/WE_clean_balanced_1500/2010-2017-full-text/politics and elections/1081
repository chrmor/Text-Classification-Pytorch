China Continues Crackdown on Prominent Dissidents
BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have charged another veteran human rights activist with attempting to subvert the state, the latest in a series of indictments or trials of well-known dissidents that have brought unusually stiff prison sentences and widespread condemnation abroad.
In the latest case, Zhu Yufu, 58, a writer and democracy advocate, was charged with subversion in Hangzhou for writing a poem that urged citizens to gather to defend their freedoms.
Contacted by telephone on Tuesday, Mr. Zhu’s lawyer, Li Dunyong, said a date for Mr. Zhu’s trial had not been set. Reuters quoted Mr. Li as saying his client was in good condition.
Mr. Li said Mr. Zhu wrote the poem early last year, as uprisings in the Middle East led a small number of activists outside China to issue an Internet call for a “Jasmine Revolution.” The Chinese authorities have responded by drastically intensifying a crackdown on rights activists that dated from December 2008, when the writer and intellectual Liu Xiaobo was detained after helping write the Charter 08 democracy manifesto.
Mr. Liu was convicted of subversion in December 2009, and in 2010, while serving an 11-year prison sentence, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Last March, a court in Sichuan Province sentenced another activist, Liu Xianbin, to 10 years in prison on subversion charges, and another prominent rights activist in Sichuan, Chen Wei, drew a nine-year subversion sentence in December. On Dec. 26, a Guizhou Province court sentenced Chen Xi to 10 years for subversion.
