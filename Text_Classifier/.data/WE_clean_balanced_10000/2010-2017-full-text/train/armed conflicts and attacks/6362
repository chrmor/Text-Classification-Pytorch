IDF kills 2 Palestinians on Gaza border
IDF troops killed two Palestinians near the Gaza Strip border, Palestinian medics said on Thursday.
A military spokesman said forces had opened fire on a group of Palestinians who attempted to cross Israel's border fence on Wednesday night.
"Yesterday an IDF force identified a number of suspects tinkering with the border fence in the northern Gaza Strip," the IDF said in a statement, adding that the soldiers had shot and killed the possible infiltrators.
"Terror agents take advantage of their presence near the border fence to lay explosive devices and plan attacks and kidnappings of IDF soldiers, and this endangers the citizens of Israel as well as security forces operating in the area," the statement said.
There was no immediate word on the identities of the two men who Palestinian medical officials said were killed.
Meanwhile, terrorists fired a mortar shell at Israel, which landed in open spaces in Sdot Negev Regional Council. No injuries or damage were reported.
Recently violence has increased in the south, with the Air Force bombing two targets in Gaza Tuesday night. The IDF said the strike had targeted terror hubs.
