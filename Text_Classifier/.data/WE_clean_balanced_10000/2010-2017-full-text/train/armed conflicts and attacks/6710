British soldier killed and nine wounded in Taliban suicide attack
The assault happened on Monday night in Nad-e Ali, an area where British forces have faced stiff resistance since arriving in 2006.
Security for the region, notorious for its poppy cultivation, was handed over to the Afghan National Army last year but British troops remain in an advisory and training role.
Hours later eight suicide bombers attacked a police station in the eastern city of Jalalabad, killing at least five officers.
The bloody period coincided with the visit of John Kerry, US Secretary of State, who was in Kabul to build bridges with President Hamid Karzai and keep relations on track as American forces prepare to leave next year.
Whether by design or accident the two attacks illustrate the challenges faced by Afghan security forces as they take more and more responsibility for security.
The attack in Nad-e Ali began with the detonation of a minivan loaded with explosives, according to local officials, and was followed by a firefight as insurgents tried to force their way inside the base.
One British soldier was severely wounded and flown to Camp Bastion, the British military headquarters in Helmand. He later died.
Afghan forces were also among the wounded.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the movement, said: “There was a suicide bomber in a van who blew himself up and 10 Taliban entered the base.”
The troops are part of Nato’s International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf), which earlier in the day said: “We can confirm that last night in Nad-e Ali district, Helmand province, insurgents attacked a combined Afghan and Isaf patrol base with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device and small arms fire. A number of insurgents were killed.
“Several Isaf service members were wounded in the attack, one seriously. The base is currently secure and fully operational.”
Soldiers from several regiments led by the 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment, are serving in the area
The bold attack on a base comes at the end of the winter’s lull in fighting.
Eight suicide bombers struck a police headquarters in Jalalabad, about 75 miles east of Kabul, on Tuesday killing at least five officers, a security official said.
First, an insurgent in an explosives-laden car detonated his vehicle in front of the Jalalabad Police Quick Reaction Force. Then, seven other attackers wearing vests rigged with explosives stormed the compound in the sort of combined commando attack.
John Kerry held a further meeting with President Karzai, following their show of unity a day earlier. He also met civic leaders and a group of businesswomen to hear their concerns for women’s rights after international forces leave at the end of next year.
He arrived on a surprise visit amid concerns that President Karzai was putting the transition at risk with a series of anti-American rants.
