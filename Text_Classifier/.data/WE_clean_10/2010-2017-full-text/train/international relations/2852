The meeting is seen as a positive signal.

The US dollar has been weakening, against other Asian currencies, since mid-September. This, has fueled speculation, that governments MAY depreciate their currencies, to encourage exports. Washington, has tended to use China as a scapegoat for trade imbalances,... accusing Beijing of keeping the value of the Yuan deliberately low.
