TransAsia Airways Corp., the struggling Taiwanese airline that has suffered two deadly crashes since 2014, is closing down.
An emergency board meeting concluded that the island’s No. 3 carrier should be shut down, company representatives said at a news conference on Tuesday, after the company failed to restore confidence in the wake of the fatal incidents.
