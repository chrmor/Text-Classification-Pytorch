Dutch prosecutor's office, police under cyber attack
The websites of the Dutch prosecutor's office and police came under cyber attacks Friday, "probably" linked to the arrest of a supporter of whistleblower website WikiLeaks, officials said.
The 16-year-old supporter who has admitted to staging attacks on opponents of WikiLeaks, such as Visa and Mastercard, was remanded in custody following his arrest overnight Wednesday in The Hague, police said.
Believed to be part of a larger group of hackers, he was questioned by a judge in Rotterdam on Friday.
"The two sites have become victims of denial-of-service attacks, police spokesman Rom Looije told AFP. Both sites were "only difficult to access or not at all" early Friday.
The public prosecutor's office said the attack on its website was "probably linked to the arrest of a 16-year-old boy" but added that its website did not contain any sensitive information.
An AFP journalist noted that an anonymous group claimed the attack under its user name AnonTarget in a Twitter message "in reaction to the arrest of a 16-year-old activist".
