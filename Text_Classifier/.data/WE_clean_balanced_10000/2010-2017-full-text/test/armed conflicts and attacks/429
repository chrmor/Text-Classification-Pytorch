U.S. says missile strikes on Libya only first phase
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A series of more than 110 cruise missile strikes on Libyan targets is only the first phase of a multiphase operation, a senior U.S. military official said on Saturday.
Vice Admiral Bill Gortney, director of the U.S. militaryâ€™s Joint Staff, declined to discuss what the next phase of the operations would be. He said more than 20 sites had been targeted in coalition strikes so far.
