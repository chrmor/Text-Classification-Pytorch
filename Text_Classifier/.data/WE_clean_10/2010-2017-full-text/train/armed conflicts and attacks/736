3 Jihad members killed in Gaza strike
Gaza sources reported Monday that three Palestinians were killed in an IDF strike on a militant cell.
According to the sources, the cell, which was spotted moving at the Noserat refugee camp in central Gaza, suffered a direct hit.
The three have been identified as Muhammad Abu Id, Awani Abdel-Khadi and Ala Abu Zbeida – all confirmed members of the Islamic Jihad's al-Quds Brigades. 
The sources added that shortly after the first strike, the IDF struck central Gaza a second time. No injuries were reported.
The IDF Spokesman's Unit confirmed the strike, saying that "the Israel Air Force, in a joint military-Shin Bet operation, attacked a terror cell preparing to fire at Israel."
Several rockets have been fired at Israel over the past week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Gaza vicinity communities last week and warned the Gaza groups against any escalation.
"Our first commitment is to security, and I suggest Hamas and the other organization not test us on that."
