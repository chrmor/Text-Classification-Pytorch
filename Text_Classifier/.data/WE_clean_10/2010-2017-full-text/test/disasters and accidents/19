Floods in Brazil leave more than 250 dead
Three towns in the Serrana mountain region north of Rio were devastated as landslides destroyed homes, roads and power lines and buried families alive as they slept.
Teresopolis, 62 miles north of Rio, was the worst hit town with 130 deaths recorded after hillsides gave way and a river burst its banks following the equivalent of a month's rainfall in 24 hours.
In Nova Friburgo 107 were killed, including three firemen buried by mudslides, while 20 people died in Petropolis, according to Brazil's Globo News television channel.
Thousands of people in the region were cut off from electricity and telephone contact and around 1,000 were left homeless in Teresopolis alone, according to Jorge Mario, the town's mayor.
"It's the biggest catastrophe in the history of the town," he said, as he warned the death toll could rise further as rescue workers reach remote areas.
Television images showed scenes of devastation with cars submerged by water, buses and trucks with water up to their windows, homes destroyed and tearful survivors surveying the carnage.
One resident, a 55-year-old maid, described the scene as being "like a horror film" and said she saw a baby "carried away by a torrent like a doll" as the child's mother tried in vain to save it.
Sergio Cabral, the governor of Rio state, said that he had asked the Navy for helicopters to take rescue crews and equipment to the region, which was partially cut off from Rio by road.
The devastation on Wednesday came after 13 people were killed in Sao Paulo state on Monday and Tuesday after torrential rains, which flooded major roads in Sao Paulo, the state capital and Brazil's biggest city.
The government of President Dilma Rousseff made R$780m (Â£296m) available in emergency aid to help the affected regions.
Heavy rains are common in south east Brazil during the country's summer season but have been unusually high this year even before the tragedies of this week.
