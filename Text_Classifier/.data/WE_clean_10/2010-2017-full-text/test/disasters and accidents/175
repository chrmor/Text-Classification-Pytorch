Two killed, 100 hurt in Japan aftershock
A powerful aftershock that rocked an area of Japan still reeling from last month's earthquake and tsunami disaster has killed two people and injured about 100, emergency services say.
The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said a 63-year-old woman in Yamagata prefecture died after her respirator failed when the power was knocked out by the 7.1 magnitude tremor, which hit at 11.32pm local time on Thursday (0032 AEST Friday).
"Her respiratory equipment was found turned off. We believe the machine was turned off due to the (power) outage," a spokesman for the agency said.
The agency said one person also died in Miyagi prefecture - the area worst hit by the 9.0 magnitude quake of March 11 and the tsunami it spawned.
Broadcaster NHK identified the Miyagi casualty as a 79-year-old man. It said he was found unconscious after the quake and taken to hospital, where he was confirmed dead.
The disaster management agency said at least 93 people were confirmed injured as of 9.30am on Friday (1030 AEST) while Jiji Press said about 130 were injured.
Power remains off for about 3.6 million households in the northeastern region, Jiji said.
