Google Gives $100 Million Award to Outgoing CEO
Google Inc., fresh off announcing a management shake-up, will give a $100 million equity award to Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, who in April will be succeeded by company co-founder Larry Page.
Poornima Gupta, a spokeswoman for Google, said Saturday that it was the first such award for Mr. Schmidt since he joined the company in 2001. It includes stock and stock options, and vests over four years. She declined to comment further.
