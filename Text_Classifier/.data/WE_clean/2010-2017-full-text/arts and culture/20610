Mark Ronson wins best British single at Brit awards 2015
The artist and producer picks up the award for his funk phenomenon Uptown Funk featuring Bruno Mars
Mark Ronson has won the award for best British single for Uptown Funk at this year’s Brit awards in London.
The producer and artist beat out fellow nominees Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Clean Bandit featuring Jess Glynne, Ella Henderson, Duke Dumont featuring Jax Jones, George Ezra, and Route 94 featuring Jess Glynne and Sigma.
Ronson’s single, featuring Bruno Mars, marked a revival for the British producer. His comeback single, lifted from Uptown Special, rocketed straight to No 1 following a boost by Fleur East’s cover of the track on The X Factor.
His hold on the UK charts has been continual since its release in late 2014 – it enjoyed seven non-consecutive weeks at the top of the charts following its release – with a brief interuption at Christmas when the X Factor winner Ben Haenow went to the top. With the single, Ronson has scored the most weeks at No 1 since Leona Lewis’s Bleeding Love in 2007.
