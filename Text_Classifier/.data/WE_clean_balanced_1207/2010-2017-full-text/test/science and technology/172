Poverty to soar without climate action
Poverty levels will drastically increase across the world if governments fail to take action against climate change, a new World Bank report claims.
"Hard-won" gains in poverty reduction will be irreparably lost, particularly in Africa and South Asia, if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions aren't curbed, the report suggests, potentially dragging 100 million more people into poverty by 2030.
It goes on to explain that the world's poorest are already at high risk of falling victim to environmental shocks and losing a greater amount of their assets than their wealthier counterparts.
