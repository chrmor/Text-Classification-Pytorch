Spain Evacuates Homes in El Hierro Island Due to Volcanic Activity
MADRID-- The regional government of Spain's Canary Islands has ordered the evacuation of homes and road closures near the southern tip of El Hierro island after two earth tremors and increased offshore volcanic activity caused a buildup of bad-smelling debris floating on the sea.
Seismic activity began in the area on July 17 and residents have since been rocked by more than 10,000 tremors, while underwater fissures have released an almost continuous flow of sulfurous gases, smoke and hot objects.
The government said in a statement it has evacuated 11 homes and closed the island's main road tunnel after a tremor of 3.9 magnitude on Saturday followed one of 4.4 magnitude the previous evening.
El Hierro has some 11,000 residents and was formed by volcanic activity.
