Sports Minister Mutko unanimously elected Russian Football Union chief
MOSCOW, September 2. /TASS/. Delegates of an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Football Union (RFU) have unanimously elected Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko as the RFS new chief.
Acting RFU President Nikita Simonyan handed over an official certificate of the Russian Football Union head to Mutko for a term of one year.
Mutko headed the Russian Football Union from April 2005 to November 2009. He left the post of the RFU’s chief, following a government resolution, which required that government officials should quit top positions in sports federations.
In July 2015, an exception was made for Mutko to combine the posts of the sports minister and the RFU’s head, which allowed him to take part in the elections for the helm of the Russian Football Union.
After Mutko quit the RFU in November 2009, the Russian Football Union was headed by Sergei Fursenko from February 2010 to June 2012 and Nikolai Tolstykh from September 2012 to May 2015.
Tolstykh was relieved of his duties of the RFU’s head by a decision taken by delegates of the organization’s conference in May over the deplorable financial state of the Russian Football Union whose debts amounted to about 1.5 billion rubles ($23 million).
The organization’s conference elected 88-year-old Simonyan as the RFU’s acting head at the time. After Mutko’s election as the new chief of the Russian Football Union, Simonyan has resumed his ditties as the RFU’s first vice-president.
The next elections of the RFU’s head will be held within six months after the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro scheduled to take place on August 5-21, 2016 come to an end.
