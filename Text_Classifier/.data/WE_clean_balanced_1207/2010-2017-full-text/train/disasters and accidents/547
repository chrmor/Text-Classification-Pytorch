2 dead, 6 missing in eastern Kentucky floods
Officials in eastern Kentucky say a second person has been found dead after floodwaters rushed through the region, leaving six others unaccounted for.
Teams searched on the ground and used a helicopter in the hilly Appalachian terrain Tuesday, with the threat of more floods bearing down on rescue efforts.
Kentucky State Police Trooper Steven Mounts said emergency personnel in the hardest-hit neighborhoods in Johnson County are struggling with debris, downed power lines and difficult communication as they search for those who might be trapped in their homes.
The second victim was a woman, found Tuesday afternoon.
Officials said 15 people were treated at a local hospital and released.
Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear declared a state of emergency to give local officials immediate access to state resources to assist in recovery efforts.
