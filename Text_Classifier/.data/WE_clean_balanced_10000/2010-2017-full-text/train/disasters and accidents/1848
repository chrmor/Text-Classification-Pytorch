Kolkata flyover collapse: Five officials detained, forensic team collects sample from accident site
At least 24 people have been killed and another 100 injured after an under-construction flyover collapsed in North Kolkata near Ganesh Talkies (Girish Park), Thursday afternoon. The location of the bridge is in a densely populated locality in Barabazar.
Rescue operations are currently under-way in a joint operation by the NDRF and the Army.
Eyewitness said they heard a loud explosion and then a crashing sound. “A cloud of smoke emerged from the collapse,” they said.

Amidst the dust and debris, the big question was this: what led to the disaster? While a probe ordered by the government is expected to come up with answers, there were some clues on the ground. Officials said that the Left Front government had first come up with the idea of a flyover to de-congest this choked Burrabazar stretch. Work began in 2007 but stopped two years later because of shortage of funds.

It is a Rs 164-crore project which the Left front government had initiated in 2007 to facilitate the movement of traffic as well as pedestrians in this busy and clogged stretch of the central business district in Burrabazar-Posta. The completion of the bridge was expected to ease the congestion of vehicular traffic as well as men moving from north and east Kolkata to Howrah.
It was learnt that right from inception, locals objected to its design as some stretches of the flyover crossed menacingly close to multi storied buildings,flanking on both sides of the existing road stretch. State government sources said that there was considerable pressure from the state urban development department to ensure speedy completion of the project.
There were some outstanding issue of land clearance to be given by the Kolkata Port Trust to the state government on the Howrah end of the flyover. But the issue was reportedly resolved after the intervention of the chief minister Mamata Banerjee and work was on full swing on the flyover for its speedy completion.
