US recognises Somali government after 20 years
The United States has officially recognised the government of Somalia for the first time in more than 20 years.
The country descended into anarchy after warlords toppled a military dictatorship in 1991.
The US never formally severed diplomatic ties, but the announcement underscores support for the new government which was elected last year.
