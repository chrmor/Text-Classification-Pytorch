Deception Foils Attempt to Hijack Turkish Jet to Sochi
A passenger, Mehmet Tutar, said the pilot even announced that they had arrived in Sochi. “I didn’t even see him,” said Mr. Tutar, who was seated in the back of the plane, referring to the hijacker. “I just heard something. I thought it was a drunk guy.”
Passengers’ relatives and friends who went to Sabiha Gokcen, on the Asian side of Istanbul, described tense cellphone conversations with those on the plane.
“We came here early to pick up my father’s wife,” Firat Altan, 19, said. “She was very anxious when I talked to her on the phone, and said the hijacker could not be persuaded by the crew and yelled that he had a bomb on board. I heard some passengers crying in the background.”
Mufit Goren, who was waiting for two female friends on board, said they told him that “the hijacker constantly threatened to detonate a bomb with his mobile if anyone neared him, and said he wanted to go to Sochi. He could freely walk along the aisles even when Turkish channels reported that he was taken under control by the security forces.”
Passengers were reachable on their telephones for nearly four hours until the security units entered the aircraft. Traffic to and from the airport was halted until the authorities announced that the plane had been secured and the Ukrainian passenger was in custody.
