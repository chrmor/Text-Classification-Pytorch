Death Sentences Are Reported for 2 Myanmar Officials
BANGKOK — A court in Myanmar has sentenced a retired military officer and a Foreign Ministry official to death for leaking details of a secret trip to North Korea by top government officials, according to news reports that cited lawyers in the country.
There has been no mention in the official media in military-run Myanmar of the court decision, which was said to have been handed down Thursday and was first reported on The Irrawaddy, an exile news Web site based in Thailand that covers Myanmar.
Another Foreign Ministry official received 15 years in prison for a related offense, according to The Irrawaddy and Reuters.
The case appeared to highlight the repressive government’s concern about a number of leaks and lapses in recent years, including the publication of minutes of high-level military meetings and photographs of extensive tunnel systems reportedly built by North Korean engineers in the country’s administrative capital, Naypyidaw.
“Clearly there are leaks,” said Win Min, an expert on Myanmar at Payap University in Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand. “It’s a sign that there are a lot of people even within the military who do not like the government, and they’re trying to protest in different ways.”
