Brisbane weather, Cyclone Lam, Emergency services gearing up as cyclone predicted
Queensland's north is on cyclone watch while residents in the south-east prepare for destructive winds, abnormally high tides, dangerous surf and as much as two months' rain in a day.
The Bureau of Meteorology is warning a low hovering in the Coral Sea about 1000km off Bundaberg is likely to become a tropical cyclone as it heads south-east in the next 24 hours.
It's predicted to bring 200-400mm of rain between Rockhampton and the Gold Coast from Thursday with higher falls likely in localised areas.
The Queensland Fire and Emergency Service and the State Emergency Service are both gearing up for a busy few days and urging residents to do the same.
