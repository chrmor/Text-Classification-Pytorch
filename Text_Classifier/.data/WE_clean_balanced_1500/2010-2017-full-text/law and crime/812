UK officials 'made' Guardian destroy files
The Guardian's editor claims leaked information it held from Edward Snowden was destroyed following government demands.
In a column in Tuesday's edition, Alan Rusbridger said he had received a call from a government official, who told him, "You've had your fun. Now we want the stuff back."
He claims that GCHQ officials supervised the destructions of computer hard-drives which contained leaked files.
Rusbridger told the BBC that there needs to be a balance between state security and freedom of speech.
