UK plane lands at Athens after bomb threat
A British passenger plane has made an emergency landing in Athens following a bomb threat, officials say.
Greek fighter jets were scrambled to escort the Thomson Airways Boeing 757-200, which was on its way from Bristol to the popular resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.
All 213 people on board the plane are said to be unharmed.
The plane is undergoing checks in a remote area of Athens International Airport, authorities there said.
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant, in Athens, says the bomb threat was received by an Egyptian news agency and passed on to the crew of the plane.
The crew put out a mayday while over northern Greece and two F-16 jets were sent to escort it to Athens.
Once it had landed, there was an orderly evacuation and the plane was taken to a remote area of the airfield where experts were carrying out a search, our correspondent adds.
