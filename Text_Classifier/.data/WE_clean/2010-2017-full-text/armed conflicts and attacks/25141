Yemen officials: UAE troops pull out, Aden airport is shut
Yemeni officials say troops from the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the airport in the southern city of Aden, a day after it was stormed by disgruntled pro-government fighters from the country's south.
The officials say the Emiratis pulled out on Wednesday.
The authorities then shut the airport, the country's main air hub for the internationally recognized government and the Saudi-led coalition, which is helping the government forces fight Shiite rebels in the north. The UAE forces are part of the anti-rebel coalition.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
Yemen's nearly year-long conflict has killed at least 6,000 people. The fighting is pitting the government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, against Shiite rebels known as Houthis.
