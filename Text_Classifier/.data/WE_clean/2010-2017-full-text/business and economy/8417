Job losses due to patchwork economy
FEDERAL Treasurer Wayne Swan has attributed job losses at Qantas and steel maker OneSteel to Australia's patchwork economy.
Qantas Airways announced today that 1000 jobs would be affected, while OneSteel plans to slash more than 400 jobs.
Mr Swan said Qantas's decision was a result of a deterioration in demand for some international routes, while OneSteel was the victim of the high Australian dollar - a situation he expected would remain for some time.
The Government was committed to strengthening the economy in every way and spreading opportunities from the resources boom across the nation's economy.
"What we are experiencing here are the challenges that do come from a patchwork economy," Mr Swan told reporters in Canberra.
"Our fundamentals are strong, not everybody is doing well, and that there are soft spots in the economy, particularly those that are impacted by our higher dollar."
The treasurer said Australia's high dollar was putting pressure on steel makers.
"These are challenges and structural changes impacting on our economy from a change in circumstances," he said, adding that the Australian dollar was going to remain higher than tradition levels because of high commodity prices.
"And that will last for some time," he said.
Mr Swan said the immediate issue for Qantas and OneSteel was to look after their workers.
Transport Minister Anthony Albanese said the Qantas decision was regrettable.
"But the Government acknowledges that this is a commercial decision taken by Qantas," he said in a statement.
