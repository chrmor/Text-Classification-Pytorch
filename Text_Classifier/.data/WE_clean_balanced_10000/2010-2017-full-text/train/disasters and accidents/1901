Puerto Rico left entirely without power 
The British Virgin Islands have been "spared the worst" from Hurricane Maria, the governor has said, as the storm continues her path of destruction towards another UK overseas territory, PA reports.
Gus Jaspert, governor of the British Virgin Islands, which was wrecked by Hurricane Irma two weeks ago, said initial assessments suggested fresh damage is relatively low.
"We had high winds, we had a bit of flooding, and we had bit of a storm surge that knocked out some of the roads - but that thankfully we have been spared the worst", he said.
"We are very mindful that others and colleagues in the region felt its full force and our thoughts are very much with them at the moment."
Mr Jaspert said one of his first priorities on Thursday is to head to the other British Virgin Islands on a helicopter from RFA Mounts Bay to fully assess the damage there.
"We prepared for the worst, it hasn't been the worst which is good. We are back on to our recovery focus, which is our key thing," he said.
He revealed that there were no deaths, but that someone who was seriously injured during the latest hurricane is due to be medevaced off Virgin Gorda on Thursday.
