NATO jets strike inside Gaddafi compound
TRIPOLI, April 25 (Reuters) - A NATO airstrike flattened a building inside Muammar Gaddafi’s Bab al-Aziziyah compound early on Monday, in what a press official from Gaddafi’s government said was an attempt on the Libyan leader’s life.
Firefighters were still working to extinguish flames in a part of the wrecked building when journalists were brought on a government-organised trip to the scene, a few hours after three loud explosions shook central Tripoli.
The press official, who asked not to be identified, said Gaddafi used the destroyed building for ministerial and other meetings. She said 45 people were injured, including 15 who were seriously hurt, and some were still unaccounted for after the attack.
