Euro 2016: Portugal beats France 1-0 in extra-time through Eder wondergoal to claim first title
A dramatic wondergoal from striker Eder has won Portugal its first European championship, breaking French hearts with a 1-0 win at the Stade de France.
After a goalless 90 minutes, most notable for an early injury to Cristiano Ronaldo and the influx of moths that took over the stadium, Portugal began to take over the match in extra-time and substitute Eder proved the match-winner.
After cutting inside past two French defenders, the Lille striker unleashed on his right boot past Hugo Lloris, stunning the vocal home crowd and sending the Portugal bench into euphoria.
It was a rare moment of individual class in a match that, much like the tournament on the whole, failed to reach any great heights.
The early injury to Ronaldo had many expecting the end of the game as a contest, but in many ways the loss of its star player galvanised Portugal.
A hard but mostly fair challenge from Dimitri Payet twisted Ronaldo's knee, and despite the Real Madrid man trying on two occasions to run it off, the injury soon got the better of him.
It was to be Payet's most meaningful contribution of the match, as the star of the tournament's opener back in early June was subbed off before the hour mark.
Chances were rare, but when they came they generally fell to the French. Antoine Griezmann, the tournament's golden boot winner and breakout star, missed a simple headed chance in the second half of normal time while Andre-Pierre Gignac hit the post after a smart turn in the 90th minute.
Portugal didn't register a shot on target until late in normal time, when a Nani cross was deflected to Ricardo Quaresma, whose acrobatic overhead effort was comfortably dealt with by Lloris.
But when extra-time rolled around, and with Ronaldo hobbling and barking orders along the touchline, Portugal found a winning edge through an unlikely source.
Eder's goal sent tears flowing in the stands and on the pitch, with this highly-fancied France thwarted by a team that only managed one win in 90 minutes throughout the entire tournament.
Questions will be asked as to why Anthony Martial was not given a minute in the final, while Paul Pogba's touted 100-million-pound move to Manchester United will raise eyebrows after an anonymous display.
But while France will be left to mop up after a disappointing conclusion to a promising tournament, the night belonged to Portugal.
Ronaldo lifted the trophy in front of his team, and while plenty will try, few should begrudge him the honour.
