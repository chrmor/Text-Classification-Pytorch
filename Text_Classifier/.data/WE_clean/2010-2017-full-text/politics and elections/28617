Donald Trump rushed off stage at Nevada rally
RENO, Nev. — Two Secret Service agents hurried Donald Trump off the stage at a Nevada political rally Saturday night after a disturbance broke out in the crowd not far from where the Republican presidential nominee was speaking.
With some attendees at the Reno event recording the incident on their phones, law-enforcement officials quickly brought the situation under control and officers were seen leading one man out of the event. One person at the rally had yelled "gun," but no weapon was found, according to a Trump campaign statement.
MSNBC later reported that the protester was let go.
Moments after the incident, Trump returned to speak, briefly alluding to the commotion and thanking the Secret Service before going on to prepared remarks.
"Nobody said it was going to be easy for us but we will never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service. They don’t get enough credit. They’re amazing people," Trump said.
Donald Newton, 47, of Santa Rosa, Calif., was right next to the bedlam when it happened and took video of the immediate aftermath. Newton said a man holding a sign started going toward the stage.
“He had something on his belly. I don’t know what it was,” Newton said. “Somebody yelled 'gun' and everyone jumped on him. My friend put his knee on his head, but he kept getting up.”
After Trump returned to the stage, the GOP nominee began talking about political issues.
"So, let’s get back to repealing the defense sequester. Right now it doesn’t sound that exciting, but it’s very important," the candidate said.
Trump issued a statement through his campaign:
