Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams set for final of raw aggression
For most of the tournament, Serena Williams has looked as if she might collapse at any moment. At times, she was barely able to make herself understood in post-match interviews, so bad were her coughing fits.
Williams, however, is not like most players. She survives in a different way, for pride that goes beyond performance. She is driven by criticism, non-acceptance – and there is the small matter of her opponent in the final of the Australian Open on Saturday, Maria Sharapova.
While Williams has been cut down by serious illness in the past, her thirst for success is still strong, enough to drive her on when, as she admits, she does not need any more titles. If anything will lift her in difficult moments it will be the sight of an opponent she has beaten 15 times in a row, against whom she lost most famously in the 2004 Wimbledon final when Sharapova was 17.
That is dominance on a crushing scale, yet Williams tried her best to guide questioners away from the prickly subject of a rivalry that extends beyond the tennis court. They were rivals in love, too, and Serena lost.
While Sharapova declared after coming through the semi-finals, “I will do everything I can to get that title,” she sounded like a burglar with her eye on some well-guarded diamonds. Williams, however, is taking a different view of what everyone else regards as by some way the best available final. “I want to win it,” she said, “but it’s not life or death.”
Maybe not. But there are plenty of temporal prizes on offer. Williams, for all her insouciance, wants a 19th major, bringing her within three of the 22 slams Steffi Graf won in the Open era, and five away from Margaret Court’s all-time record.
If she is fit – and that is never a given with Williams, who had another injury scare when she stopped training on Friday – she is capable of hauling down both those records, although the emergence of Madison Keys, who gave her a good fight in the semi-finals, may change the equation.
Good judges reckon Keys hits the ball harder than Williams, off the ground and from hand, but it is doing it to best effect that counts and there have been moments in this tournament when Williams has struck the ball as well as at any time in her long career.
Their paths to the final have followed similar patterns. Williams has played a total of eight hours and 34 minutes, Sharapova a minute under nine hours; their opponents have average rankings of 67; Williams has won 12 of her 14 sets, Sharapova 12 of 13. They are only numbers but ones that, when crunched, tell a story of minor struggle before prevailing against almost identical level of opponents.
While the American with five Australian titles to her name will understandably start as the favourite, for once Sharapova is within touching distance of her. It would not be a major surprise if she won.
It is the first Australian final between the two highest-ranked players in the world since Justine Henin, the world No1 in 2004, beat Kim Clijsters.
If Williams makes it 16 in a row against the Russian, it will be her 100th career win against a top-five player, the true mark of class in tennis. She is also the oldest player, at 33, to reach the Australian final in the Open era.
Sharapova, still only 27 and in good health after intermittent periods out through injury over the years, knows she has more miles left on the clock than Williams. As in the men’s game, however, she is aware also that there is a new generation closing in, that there will be more tight results early in big tournaments than in the past and that just getting to the final weekend will be a considerable achievement.
She was due talk to the media on Friday but declined, an indicator of her determination to beat Williams – as well as her impatience with some of the monotonous questions that come her way in press conferences.
Before going into temporary hibernation, Sharapova said: “My confidence should be pretty high going into a final of a grand slam, no matter who I’m facing – and whether I’ve had a terrible record, to say the least, against someone. It doesn’t matter. I got there for a reason. I belong in that spot.”
If Williams is the most confident player in women’s tennis on merit – “The result is on my racket” – Sharapova is not far behind. They have more in common than either of them would want to admit, a grudging respect and zero mutual warmth.
Theirs will be another shrill, emotional test of wills, with little subtlety, a lot of raw aggression and, if history is at all reliable, an American winner yet again.
