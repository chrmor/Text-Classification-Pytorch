Internet top domains to expand
The internet is set for one of its most significant changes in years, after the global governing body for domain names approved a major expansion.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) on Monday approved the expansion of domain names beyond ".com" to ".anything".
Top-level domains, which include .com, .net and .org, will be expanded to include new brand, generic and geographic domain name extensions - such as .shop, .sydney, .apple, .bhp or .nab, for example.
Domain name management provider Melbourne IT Ltd said the expansion represented a big change.
"It's significant for the whole internet community," Melbourne IT chief executive Theo Hnarakis said.
He said companies, community groups and cities would be able to apply for their name as a top-level domain.
