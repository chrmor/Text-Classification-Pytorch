Siena, last in Serie A, tabs Giuseppe Iachini new coach
Siena appointed former Sampdoria boss Giuseppe Iachini as their new coach after dismissing Serse Cosmi on Sunday night.
The Bianconeri parted company with Cosmi following a 4-1 defeat at Tuscan rivals Fiorentina that left the side propping up the Serie A table, and the 48-year-old Iachini is the man charged with reversing the club's fortunes.
"I promise to bring hard work and determination to achieve the objective of surviving in Serie A," Iachini told the club's website. "If there is one main reason why I came here then it is because I believe in the ability of these boys."
Iachini replaced Gianluca Atzori at Sampdoria in November last year, steering the Ligurians back to Serie A through the playoffs, but promptly losing his job to former Juventus boss Ciro Ferrara, who was also sacked Monday.
"I took the decision to make a change on the bench after the defeat in Florence, because I firmly believe in the players and the possibility of salvation," Siena president Massimo Mezzaroma told the club's official website.
Siena remain bottom of the league table despite picking up 17 points so far, a tally that would have seen them sit in 14th place if not for the six-point deduction applied for their alleged involvement in the summer's betting scandal.
The Bianconeri's performances have faltered over recent weeks, though, with Sunday's heavy loss marking a third consecutive reverse to leave Siena with just two wins from their last 12 games.
Iachini's first game in charge sees third-placed Napoli visit the Stadio Artemio Franchi, with Siena four points shy of 17th-placed Palermo and safety.
