Egypt’s Tamarod founder survives assassination attempt
Mahmoud Badr, the founder of Tamarod, the Egyptian youth movement that rallied street protests against ousted President Mohammad Mursi, survived assassination attempt on Monday, Al Arabiya’s correspondent reported from Cairo.
Tamarod’s official website reported that gunmen opened fire on his car and that he was not harmed.
Amro Badr, the editor of Tamarod’s website, said the group had filed a police report on the incident.
He noted that the founder of Tamarod was attacked when he was going home following a session of the 50-member panel tasked with reviewing a draft constitution.
Mahmoud Badr previously said he received threats and was forced to change his residence to an unknown location.
The incident came a week after Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim also survived an assassination attempt.
A car bomb ripped through the interior minister’s convoy as he was leaving home for work on Thursday, killing one person.
Ibrahim, who was travelling in an armored car, survived the attempt unhurt.
An al-Qaeda-linked group based in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula claimed responsibility for the failed attack.
“God has allowed your brothers in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis [the Sinai-based group] to shatter the security organization of the murderer Mohammed Ibrahim through a martyrdom operation,” the group said in an online statement carried by Agence France-Presse.
The militant group apologized in the statement “for not killing the tyrant,” pledging more attacks against Ibrahim and the head of Egypt’s armed forces,  Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
