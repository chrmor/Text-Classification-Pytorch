Hungary sludge an 'ecological disaster'
Hungary has declared a state of emergency after a toxic mud spill swamped seven villages killing four people and injuring 120 others in what officials said was the country's worst-ever chemical accident.
Eight injured were in a serious condition and six people were missing after the walls of a reservoir of residue at an aluminium plant broke on Monday afternoon and officials feared the death toll could rise.
The sludge left a path of devastation in its wake destroying all vegetation other than trees, seeping into houses and leaving residents asking when they could return.
The two-metre tide of mud overturned cars, swept away possessions and has raised fears that pollution leeching from it could reach the Danube River.
Interior Minister Sandor Pinter insisted there was no threat so far to drinking water in the area but warned against eating home-grown produce from the region for the time being.
"It's an ecological catastrophe," said environment state secretary Zoltan Illes, who visited the area on Tuesday, describing it as the worst chemical accident in the country.
