Syrian forces release 300 people in Banias-group
AMMAN, May 10 (Reuters) - Syrian forces released on Tuesday 300 people who had been arrested in Banias since tanks stormed residential areas in the coastal city last week, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Water, telecommunications and electricity have been restored, but tanks remain deployed in major streets, the Observatory said. Another 200 people, among them pro-democracy protest leaders, remained in jail, the group said. (Reporting by Khaled Yacoub Oweis; Editing by Louise Ireland)
