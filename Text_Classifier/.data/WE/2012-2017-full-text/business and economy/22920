PenAir Plans to Shed Denver, Portland Hubs in Chapter 11
Regional airline Peninsula Airways Inc. filed for bankruptcy over the weekend, blaming its financial decline on money-losing hubs in Portland, Ore., and Denver that it plans to shut down.
Alaska-based Peninsula, which does business as PenAir, will wind down the Portland and Denver hubs while maintaining operations at its more successful hub in Boston, according to a bankruptcy document submitted by Chief Operating Officer David M. Richards. He said the bankruptcy was necessary after a “rapid deterioration” in financial results.
