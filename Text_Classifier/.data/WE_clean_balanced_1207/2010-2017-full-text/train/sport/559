Football pundits caught ridiculing female linesman on air
A pair of British television football pundits were caught offside when they made "unacceptable remarks" off-air about a woman assistant referee officiating in a Premier League clash.
Sky Sports said presenter Richard Keys and pundit Andy Gray, a former Scottish international striker, have apologised for their comments regarding Sian Massey.
The pair commented on Massey's appointment for the game between Wolves and Liverpool at Molineux on Saturday, when they believed their microphones were switched off.
Keys said: "Somebody better get down there and explain offside to her."
