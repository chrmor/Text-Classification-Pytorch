David Beckham given MLS ban for "provocative behaviour"
David Beckham has been given a one-game ban and fined an undisclosed amount for his "confrontational and provocative behaviour" during LA Galaxy's 4-3 defeat by San Jose.
The former England captain was involved in a scuffle on the pitch during the Major League Soccer match on Saturday.
Angry at perceived time-wasting, he kicked the ball at Sam Cronin as the player lay on the ground.
After being booked, Beckham then argued with opponents after the final whistle.
An MLS statement said: "The committee considered his conduct unacceptable and detrimental to the league's public image.
"Beckham will serve his suspension on Sunday when the Galaxy take on the Chicago Fire."
It completes a few days to forget for the 37-year-old, who was left out of Great Britain's Olympic squad for London 2012.
"Form plays a big part and I don't think there is a manager around who picks on sentiment," said Team GB manager Stuart Pearce when explaining the midfielder's omission.
"I have to be comfortable when I have made decisions based solely on football grounds alone, nothing else."
