Naomi Campbell 'hurt' in Paris mugging attempt
Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been injured in an attempted mugging in Paris, reports say.
French police have confirmed that two men on a motorcycle tried to grab her handbag as she sat in a car in the trendy Marais neighbourhood on 21 November.
US media reported that the British model suffered a torn ligament in her left leg in the attack.
She has since been pictured in a wheelchair with her leg in a brace.
A police source quoted by the UK's Press Association said: "On November 21, two people on a motorbike attempted to steal Ms Campbell's handbag as she sat in a vehicle on Rue de Moussy.
"She filed a complaint with police in the 4th arrondissement but she did not agree to a medical examination."
A spokesman for the 42-year-old model declined to comment on the incident.
