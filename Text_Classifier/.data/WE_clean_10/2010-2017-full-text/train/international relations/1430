U.N. General Assembly Appoints António Guterres as Next Secretary-General
UNITED NATIONS—The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday officially appointed António Guterres of Portugal as its next secretary-general as he pledged to combat terrorism and extremism while also fighting “xenophobia” and populism.
The 193-member General Assembly voted by acclamation after the Security Council last week nominated Mr. Guterres for the post following straw polls that showed him leading a dozen other candidates.
