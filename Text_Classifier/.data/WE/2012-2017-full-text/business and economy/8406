Target refuses to sell Beyonce's new album
Not everyone is crazy in love with Beyoncé's record-breaking, game-changing new album, which sold a whopping 617,000 copies in three days following its surprise iTunes release early Friday morning.
Target is refusing to sell the physical album when it hits store shelves on Friday, citing that the pop star's decision to release it digitally first could negatively affect sales, according to Billboard.
"At Target we focus on offering our guests a wide assortment of physical CDs, and when a new album is available digitally before it is available physically, it impacts demand and sales projections," Target spokeswoman Erica Julkowski told Billboard.
She continues, saying that while they "appreciated partnering with Beyoncé in the past" on her last album, 4 (which received an exclusive Target release with six additional tracks), they will "not be carrying Beyoncé's new self-titled album Beyoncé."
Don't cry for Bey quite yet, though. Her album is still expected to easily top the Billboard album chart this week, giving the pop diva her fifth consecutive No. 1 and the largest debut of her career (ahead of B'Day in 2006, which moved 541,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan).
