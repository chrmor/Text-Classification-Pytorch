Argentines set to choose new president
Voters are due to go to the polls in Argentina to choose a new president, to replace Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner who has governed for the last eight years.
While all the candidates seeking to replace her agree on foreign policy, including applying more diplomatic pressure over the Falkland Islands, there is sharp disagreement on economic policy.
