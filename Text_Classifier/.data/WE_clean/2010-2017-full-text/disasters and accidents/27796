247 dead 'including many children' after rescue efforts throughout the night 
The earthquake that struck central Italy on Wednesday has killed at least 247 people, the country's civil protection agency said in the early hours of Thursday, doubling the count of the previous evening.
Amid scenes of carnage, dozens of emergency services staff and volunteers were determined to attempt to pluck more survivors from the ruins.
Rescuers had pledged to work through the night in the hope of finding people alive in the mangled wreckage of homes.
