United Kingdom: Salman Rushdie, others protest UK immigration rules
In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, 120 writers and artists have criticised the points-based visa system as "inappropriate for short-term visits by artists".
Besides Rushdie, signatories to the letter include Kureishi, Kunzru, Ruth Padel, Kamila Shamsie, Michael Morpurgo, Anita Sethi and Simon Singh.
They said: "Writers and performers who have long been welcomed by Britain now find that they are required to undergo a visa application process that is needlessly bureaucratic and intrusive".
"Non-European Union artists wishing to enter the country have been treated poorly, either through the application process or at entry points".
The signatories said that acclaimed artists, such as the Cannes Palme d'Or-winning director Abbas Kiarostami, and Grigory Sokolov, one of the world's great concert pianists, had been dissuaded from future visits.
The letter said: "The 'licensed sponsors' system places a burden on arts organisations, many of which cannot afford the cost or cope with the administrative burden. Nor do they wish to be required (or are in many cases able) to 'monitor' the artists they invite".
It said as short-term visits by artists have no impact on migration, there is no need to administer their entry via the points-based system.
Arguing that artists who showcase their talents do not take away employment from UK or EU nationals and are paid, they said there is no need to place extra strictures on them.
"There already exists, outside the points-based system, a route for entertainers who attend festivals," the letter pointed out.
This will enable artists attend their exhibitions, writers to be paid for reading from their works, and musicians to be paid for performing.
"Our great tradition of cultural exchange is being badly damaged through the points-based system, and in the long term we will suffer economically.
"As we approach the Cultural Olympiad's culminating year, this is a situation that must change," the signatories said.
