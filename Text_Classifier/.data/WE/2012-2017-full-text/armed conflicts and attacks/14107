Thai police find bomb materials in 2nd apartment
BANGKOK (AP) â€” The latest on the investigation in the Bangkok shrine bombing (all times local):
Thai police probing Bangkok's deadly bombing say they have discovered bomb-making materials during a raid of a second apartment on the outskirts of the capital.
National police spokesman Prawuth Thavornsiri said Monday that police found fertilizer, gun powder, digital clocks and remote-controlled cars whose parts can be used for detonation, among other items, during a raid over the weekend at an apartment in Bangkok's Min Buri district.
Prawuth said "these are bomb-making materials" and added that police are looking to issue three or four arrest warrants but declined to give more details.
Min Buri is near the neighborhood where police on Saturday arrested an unnamed foreigner and seized a trove of bomb-making equipment that included detonators and ball bearings.
Prawuth said Saturday the man's nationality is still not known. He said "we are very certain he's part of the network" that carried out the Aug. 17 bombing at Bangkok's Erawan Shrine that left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured.
