Manhattan fire: Serbian Orthodox Cathedral gutted, firefighters on scene
A huge fire has ripped through a Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan on Orthodox Easter Sunday.
Videos from the scene show flames emerging from the church and smoke rising over the Madison Square area of New York.
"Huge fire at Serbian Orthodox Church ... ppl crying, horrible fire," witness Mike Gallagher said from the scene.
Local media reported that the fire broke out hours after an afternoon Easter service.
The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) tweeted that 170 personnel had been dispatched to the fire at 25th and Broadway.
It added that no injuries had been reported, and that firefighters were engaged in an "exterior operation due to heavy fire throughout the church".
The 4-alarm fire is said to have started just before 7:00pm (local time), FDNY officials said.
By about 9:40pm, the FDNY reported on Twitter that the fire was under control.
"Nothing left [but] bones of the beautiful church that was. Heartbreaking," resident Katelyn Hertel wrote on Twitter.
It is still unclear what started the fire.
The Cathedral was opened as an Episcopal church called Trinity Chapel in 1855, until it was purchased by the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1940, according to the church's website.
