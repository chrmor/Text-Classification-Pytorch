The Carolina Panthers have deactivated Greg Hardy for Sunday's home opener against the Detroit Lions.
The Pro Bowler was convicted in July on two counts of assault on a female and communicating threats, but was actively appealing the conviction. He was given a 60-day suspended sentence and 18 months probation. His next court date is Nov. 17.
Hardy was expected to start Sunday's game, but mounting pressure in the wake of issues involving the handling of discipline around former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, likely led to the Panthers' decision to deactivate Hardy.
The Vikings swiftly deactivated Peterson following his indictment Thursday on a charge of injury to a child. He turned himself into police in Montgomery County, Texas early Saturday morning and was released on $15,000 bond.
Rice initially received a two-game suspension stemming from a third-degree aggravated assault charge for attacking his then-girlfirend Janay Palmer. After video published by TMZ.com showed Rice striking Palmer and knocking her out in an Atlantic City casino elevator, the Ravens cut Rice and the NFL indefinitely suspended him.
The NFL recently overhauled its penalties regarding domestic violence -- six games for a first offense, and an indefinite suspension for at least one year for a second offense.
Those changes made by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell came before the Rice tape surfaced last week. Now the NFL has launched an independent investigation into its handling of the Rice case, and hired ex-FBI director Robert Muller to conduct the investigation.
Hardy started Week 1 in a 20-14 win at Tampa Bay where he had four tackles, including a sack. He started 13 of 16 games in 2013 with 59 total tackles, including 15 sacks. He signed a one-year $13.1 million contract last spring.
