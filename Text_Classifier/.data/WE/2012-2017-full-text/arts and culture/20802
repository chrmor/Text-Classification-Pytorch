'La La Land' breaks record for most Golden Globes won by a movie
Amy Schumer is posted up at her table with Kate Hudson and boyfriend Ben Hanisch. Schumer and her boyfriend have both been busy watching "The Bachelor." Hanisch thinks contestant Corinne will win the heart of bachelor Nick Viall,  while Schumer is questioning how far Liz will go.
In work news, Schumer is hoping her "Barbie" movie gets the official go-ahead soon. It'll be a full live-action movie and "great for girls," she says. As for the party circuit later tonight? "I'm just following Goldie around," she said, pointing to her seatmate.
Meanwhile "Toni Erdmann" star Sandra Huller just ran past Michael Keaton and grabbed him by the hand. "Come on! Let's grab a cigarette!" she urged. "I don't smoke," he responded, shaking his head apologetically.
