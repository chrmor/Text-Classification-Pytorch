The Hong Kong chief executive election
A committee will decide Hong Kong’s new leader on Sunday in the first chief executive election since mass protests brought the city to a standstill in 2014. Here is what you need to know.  
How is the chief executive elected?
The three-way race to become Hong Kong’s new leader will be decided by an election committee of 1,194 members.
This committee is made up of the 70 members of Hong Kong’s legislative chamber, and a mix of professionals, business and trade elites.
The first vote will be cast at 9am, and the three candidates need at least 601 votes to win.
If there is no overall winner, then members will vote again in the afternoon and possibly in the evening.
Runoffs between candidates have not been necessary in the four previous elections that have been held since the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
