Military helicopter crashes in Ukraine, crew died
KIEV (Reuters) - A small Ukrainian military helicopter crashed in the east of the country on Sunday, killing its two crew members and three passengers, Ukraineâ€™s defense ministry said.
The aircraft, a Soviet-designed Mi-2, crashed near Kramatorsk, the headquarter of Ukrainian government forces that oppose pro-Russian separatists, the ministry said.
The ministry said it is most likely that the Mi-2 had flown into a power line.
