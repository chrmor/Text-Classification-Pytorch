Mass Evacuations Conducted as Typhoon Hits Philippines
On Tuesday morning, the government said that no deaths or injuries had been reported, but that communications to some areas had been cut off and casualties might be discovered later. Unconfirmed news media reports and accounts from relief organizations said that a few people had died in the storm.
Still, the country seemed better prepared for a disaster than before.
After Haiyan, the national government began working with local governments to enforce mandatory evacuations in coastal areas before large storms hit the country. Mr. Aquino initiated a “zero casualties” policy for storm preparation and has held local government officials accountable when evacuations were not undertaken.
Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, said in a telephone interview that the small town of Catarman, in northern Samar, appeared to have been the hardest hit by Melor. He added that Red Cross teams in the area had seen houses destroyed, roofs blown off and trees fallen. The area was without power, water and cellphone communications.
Most of the evacuations were in Albay Province, about 300 miles south of Manila, where about 590,000 people were moved over fears of landslides along the slopes of nearby Mayon Volcano, according to Sonny Coloma, a spokesman for Mr. Aquino.
Jim Edds, a Florida-based storm chaser who has been observing typhoons in the Philippines since 2009, questioned the figure of more than 700,000 evacuated.
