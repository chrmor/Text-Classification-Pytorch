Danish police raise terror alert after charging suspected bomber
Denmark stepped up its terror alert level Saturday on the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, as police charged a man suspected of detonating a bomb in a Copenhagen hotel bathroom on Friday.
The suspect, who appeared in court Saturday, denied the charges against him - including possession of a firearm - and said through a French interpreter that he can remember neither his name nor age.
The man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg, news agency Ritzau reported.
Media reports have suggested several different origins for the man, ranging from North Africa to Luxembourg.
Jakob Scharf, head of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET), said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location.
"There are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack."
