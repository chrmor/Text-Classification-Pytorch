Duke freshmen give Blue Devils late boost for title

INDIANAPOLIS – The argument for Duke's Mike Krzyzewski as the greatest college basketball coach of all-time added another chapter at Lucas Oil Stadium on Monday night.
In defeating Wisconsin, 68-63, Krzyzewski not only won his fifth national title, putting him into second place all alone behind John Wooden's 10, but he did it with a completely different kind of team in a different type of era than his first 24 years ago.
Riding the backs of four freshmen — including the relatively unknown backup guard Grayson Allen — Duke erased a nine-point deficit in the second half despite deep foul trouble and denied Wisconsin, a much more experienced team, its first national title since 1941.
Things looked bleak for Duke with 13:25 remaining when senior center Frank Kaminsky, the national player of the year, put in his 13th point, leading Wisconsin to a 48-39 lead. Until that moment, Kaminsky had badly outplayed Duke's prized freshman big man Jahlil Okafor, who sat the final 4:47 of the first half with two fouls and picked up his fourth with 9:18 left.
But a flurry of eight points in 1 minute, 9 seconds from Allen gave the Blue Devils a jolt of energy and allowed them to pull within 51-50 while Okafor sat on the bench. Allen's layup with 5:30 remaining gave Duke a 56-54 lead, setting the stage for a ferocious finish.
"We were kind of dead in the water," Krzyzewski said. "We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back."
But unlike Wisconsin's victories over Kentucky in the semifinals and Arizona in the Elite Eight, the Badgers did not execute at key moments down the stretch and Duke hit all the big shots.
Freshman guard Tyus Jones nailed a pair of 3-pointers in the final 4:06, including the game's biggest bucket with 81 seconds left that gave Duke breathing room for one final Wisconsin push at 66-58.
Okafor, meanwhile, responded from a tough night – he went just 5-for-9 from the field with several misses near the rim – and hit huge baskets against Kaminsky with 3:14 left and putback a miss with 2:10 remaining that extended Duke's lead to 63-58.
Kaminsky finished with 21 points and 12 rebounds in his final college game.
Wisconsin looked unsettled early on offense, passing up open jumpers and missing a handful of shots around the rim. But the Badgers survived on the glass, scoring 11 second-chance points in the game's first 17 minutes to erase a six-point deficit and get into the locker room tied, 31-31.
Duke also had reason to be happy it escaped the first half without further damage. Not only was Krzyzewski visibly frustrated with the fact officials called just two fouls on Wisconsin. Duke ended up shooting 20 free throws, making 16.
Krzyzewki's first title since 2010 was also his third in Indianapolis.
