Wikileaks releases new Guantanamo files
Top-secret files detailing the interrogations of more than 700 suspects at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have been obtained by the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks.
The UK Daily Telegraph claims to have been shown thousands of pages of sensitive documents relating to a decade of interviews in which extremists admit to plotting attacks.
According to the files, which were penned by officials at the controversial base, al-Qaeda terrorists have threatened to unleash a ''nuclear hellstorm'' if Osama bin Laden is caught or killed.
The documents detail the background to the capture of each of the 780 people who have passed through the Cuban facility, along with their medical condition and the information they have provided during interrogations.
Around 220 of those detained are assessed to be dangerous international terrorists, while around 380 are judged to be lower-level foot-soldiers.
At least a further 150 people including innocent Afghans and Pakistanis were held and assessed at the US camp, but later released due to lack of evidence, according to the files.
