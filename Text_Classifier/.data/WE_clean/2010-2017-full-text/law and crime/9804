Jury Convicts R. Allen Stanford in $7 Billion Fraud Case
In the end, the jury cleared Mr. Stanford of only one of several counts of wire fraud, but found him guilty of every other count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, launder money and obstruct justice.
“We’re disappointed in the outcome and we expect an appeal — absolutely,” said Ali Fazel, one of the defense lawyers.
Cassie Wilkinson, an investor who said that she and her retired husband had to go back to work because of their losses, cried after the verdict was announced.
“I’m just relieved, happy and I’m sad,” she said. “As an investor, you have to wonder whether you were just stupid or taken advantage of. This removes the doubt. It is a vindication.”
Mr. Stanford, who wore a charcoal suit and no tie in court on Tuesday, is no longer the swaggering financier who only three years ago had an estimated fortune of over $2 billion, a knighthood awarded by Antigua and a collection of yachts, jets and mansions. He owned his own professional team and stadium and, according to prosecutors, he treated Antigua like his personal business haven, with politicians and regulators in tow, through bribes and political campaign contributions.
“There really is no dispute that Allen Stanford lied,” a federal prosecutor, William J. Stellmach, told the jurors in his closing argument, “lining his pockets with billions of dollars of other people’s money.” Another prosecutor, Gregg Costa, compared Mr. Stanford to , who is in a federal penitentiary for orchestrating an even larger Ponzi scheme until his empire collapsed four years ago.
The defense denied those charges, basing its case on the fact that Mr. Stanford’s clients had been paid on schedule until the made the first accusations three years ago, destroying the value of his businesses.
His lawyers repeatedly pointed out that his investment literature said a loss of principal was possible and that Mr. Stanford’s assets still had value when his businesses were shut down by the federal government. In their opening arguments, they suggested that Mr. Stanford would testify in his own defense, but after days of preparing him, the defense decided to rest its case without putting Mr. Stanford on the stand.
His lawyers sought to portray Mr. Stanford as detached when it came to financial details, which he ostensibly left to Mr. Davis, who pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy to obstruct an S.E.C. investigation into the Stanford business.
Defense lawyers argued that Mr. Davis had often acted without Mr. Stanford’s knowledge even as they argued that the Stanford bank had been fulfilling its promises to investors until the government stepped in and shut the firm down.
“The government wants you to believe it was all a fraud,” said Robert A. Scardino, one of Mr. Stanford’s lawyers. “That’s just not what happened.”
In his testimony, Mr. Davis portrayed his former boss as a charismatic, bullying manager who had manipulated him to lie and cheat investors. He described how Mr. Stanford had invited him to drive with him in his new on a highway outside Houston and floored the accelerator until the car reached 170 miles an hour. “He instilled intimidation and fear,” Mr. Davis said.
During cross-examination, Mr. Scardino accused Mr. Davis of manipulating financial statements and requesting that bribes be sent to an Antiguan auditor without Mr. Stanford’s knowledge. Mr. Davis countered that it was Mr. Stanford who engineered the fraud for more than two decades. Near the end of his testimony, he shook his finger at Mr. Stanford and said that anyone who wanted to know the truth about the Stanford enterprises had only to “follow the money, just follow the money.”
For the prosecution, the Stanford case was a Ponzi scheme in which he and five conspirators had given investors false financial statements indicating that the certificates of deposit were invested in conservative assets when $2 billion was actually lent to Mr. Stanford. All the while, auditors, along with the head of Antigua’s Financial Services Regulatory Commission, had received bribes to cover up the scheme and misinform the S.E.C., prosecutors said.
To Mr. Stanford’s lawyers, the financier has been a victim of an overly aggressive federal government willing to imprison him before proving his guilt. While Mr. Madoff was released on $10 million bail before his trial, prosecutors successfully argued that Mr. Stanford, who also held an Antiguan passport, could flee before a trial.
It took three years to bring Mr. Stanford to trial because he was severely beaten in a 2010 brawl with another federal inmate in a prison outside Houston and then became addicted to prescription antistress drugs. He underwent a year of therapy before Judge David Hittner of District Court ruled that he was fit to stand trial. The defense said he could not properly defend himself because he had lost much of his memory.
For Mr. Stanford, the verdict was the end of a remarkable career that began with a Texas fitness club. After it went bankrupt, he tried and lived a life of glamour. In the end, his case was overshadowed by the Madoff scandal and he is believed to be virtually penniless.
“I don’t find the verdict surprising,” said Adam Gershowitz, a criminal law professor at the , “given the extensive paper record and the fact that the record was brought to life by important witnesses like the chief financial officer.”
