China Official Cancels Appearances After Protests in Taiwan
China's top negotiator on Taiwan was forced to cancel three public appearances during a landmark bridge-building visit after protests turned violent.
Zhang Zhijun, head of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, was the first government minister to visit Taiwan since the island broke away from the mainland 65 years ago. Mr. Zhang's office said the four-day trip, which ended Saturday, had been intended to "listen to the voice of the Taiwanese people at the grass-roots level" as both sides sought reconciliation.
