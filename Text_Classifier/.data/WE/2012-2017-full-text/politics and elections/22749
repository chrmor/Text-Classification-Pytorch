U.S. hearing on human rights and Duterte drug war
The hearing is scheduled Thursday 10 pm (Manila time). Watch it live on Rappler.
MANILA, Philippines – US lawmakers conduct a hearing on Thursday, July 20, about the "human rights consequences" of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.
The hearing is scheduled at 10 pm on Thursday in Manila (10 am Thursday in Washington DC).
It is set to be conducted by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the US Congress.
Congressmen James McGovern and Randy Hultgren, co-chairmen of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, will host the hearing on Wednesday.
Hours before the hearing, Malacañang urged US lawmakers to consider "all sides" of the issue. "Insinuations and hasty judgements have no place in due process," Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said.
The hearing comes after two US senators in May filed a bill restricting the export of certain weapons and equipment from the US to the Philippine National Police as a consequence of Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
