US sends aid to flood-hit Pakistan
The United States is rushing helicopters, boats, bridges, water units and other supplies to flood-hit Pakistan as part of an initial $US10 million ($A11.1 million) aid pledge, the government says.
"The Pakistani people are friends and partners, and the United States is standing with them as the tragic human toll mounts from flooding in northwest Pakistan," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement on Sunday.
More than 1100 people have been killed by monsoon rains, flash floods and landslides in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and at least another 47 have died in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, officials say.
More than 1.5 million people have been affected, with thousands of homes and vast areas of farmland destroyed in a region of Pakistan reeling from years of extremist bloodshed.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have lost loved ones or have been displaced from their homes -- and we are taking action to help," said Clinton. "Our embassy in Islamabad is coordinating closely with Pakistani authorities to support rescue and relief efforts.
"And we will work closely with the government of Pakistan to ensure aid reaches those people who need it most. I have seen first-hand the strength and resilience of the Pakistani people and I know they will come through this tragedy with determination and compassion."
