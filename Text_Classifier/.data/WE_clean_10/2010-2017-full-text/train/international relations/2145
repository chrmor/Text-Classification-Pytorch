Clooney’s wife wants Philippine government to apologize to GMA
MANILA, Philippines - The lawyer wife of actor George Clooney has asked the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) to call on the Philippine government to issue a public apology for violating the rights of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
International human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin-Clooney believes the government violated ICCPR’s Articles 9, 14, 19 and 25 when Arroyo was placed in detention in the presidential suite of the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City despite her medical condition and political status.
The UNHRC must call for the release of Arroyo to correct the mistreatment, she added.
Clooney said Arroyo’s release from detention will   “avoid irreparable damage to her health.”
Arroyo must be temporarily released to allow her to seek medical treatment abroad, she added.
The UNHRC must also recommend granting Arroyo unrestricted access to means of communications like a mobile phone, Internet and laptop computer, she said.
