Director pleads guilty over Allman biopic train death
The director of a biopic about singer Gregg Allman has pleaded guilty in a case involving a fatal train crash on the film's set last year.
Randall Miller admitted to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing as part of a plea deal that saw charges dropped against his producer wife.
Camera assistant Sarah Jones died in the accident, which also injured six other crew members.
Miller will spend two years in county jail and another eight on probation.
The director, whose previous films include 2008's Bottle Shock, will also pay a $20,000 (Â£13,245) fine and do 360 hours of community service.
His trial had been due to start on Monday.
Jones was hit by a freight train on the first day of filming Midnight Rider - 20 February 2014 - in south east Georgia.
The 27-year-old was fatally struck after the crew placed a hospital bed on the railway tracks in Doctortown while filming a dream sequence.
The train, which was travelling at 55 mph, shattered the bed, sending a shower of debris that injured other crew members.
Jones, who had been setting up camera equipment, died instantly when she struck by the train's fuel tank and run over.
Filming was suspended in the aftermath of the accident, and actor William Hurt - who was due to play Allman - pulled out of the production.
Allman himself called for the project to be axed, saying it would be "wrong" for it to continue given "Sarah Jones' tragic death".
