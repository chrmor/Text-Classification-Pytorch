MOSCOW, November 30 (RIA Novosti) - One person was killed and at least 11 others injured by a blast and fire in an apartment building in Russia’s West Siberian city of Tomsk on Friday, city Mayor Nikolai Nikolaichuk said.
The blast on the eighth floor of a high-rise destroyed a wall, two balconies and caused a fire in two apartments on the upper floors.
The Emergencies and Civil Defense Ministry’s local administration said the blast was caused by a faulty gas canister used during apartment renovation.
However, the Investigative Committee Tomsk Region Directorate said only one person was injured when a gas supply system malfunctioned.
