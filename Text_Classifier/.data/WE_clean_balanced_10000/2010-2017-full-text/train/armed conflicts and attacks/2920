Jordan militants demand political prisoner release
More than 400 Muslim militants have protested in the streets of the Jordanian capital to demand the king release their jailed colleagues.
Tuesday's demonstration was the first public protest by Salafis - ultraconservative Muslims who observe the purist rules of Islam's early days. The group is banned in Jordan, a key US ally which advocates moderate Islamic practice. (AP)
