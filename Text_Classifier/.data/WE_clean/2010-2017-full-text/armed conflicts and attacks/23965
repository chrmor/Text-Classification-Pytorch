Germany to send 650 troops to Mali to relieve France
Germany will send up to 650 soldiers to Mali, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday, to provide some relief to France in its global fight against ISIS extremists. Berlin had previously deployed around 10 soldiers as part of the U.N. mission and von der Leyen had in October already discussed increasing the number of troops. The EU also has a military training mission in Mali (EUTM) in the relatively quiet south of the country, to which Germany has contributed 200 soldiers.
