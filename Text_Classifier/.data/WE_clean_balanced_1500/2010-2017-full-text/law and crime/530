BAGHDAD (AP) â€” Iraq's Justice Ministry says 26 prisoners convicted of terrorism-related charges have been executed, all of them Iraqi nationals.
A statement posted on the ministry's website on Tuesday says that all the executions were carried out on Sunday.
It says the suspects were found guilty of carrying out "ugly terrorist attacks" against the Iraqi people.
The statement quoted the justice minister, Hassan al-Shimari, as saying those executed included Adel-al-Mashhadani, a former anti-al-Qaeda Sunni leader in Baghdad who was sentenced to death in late 2009 for murder and kidnapping.
Human rights groups have long criticized trial procedures in Iraqi courts, arguing that some verdicts are based on testimony obtained by torture or forced statements.
The Iraqi government defends the death penalty as a weapon against insurgents bent on destabilizing the country.
