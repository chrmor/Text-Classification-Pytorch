ANCYL leaders’ convictions upheld
Convictions handed down by the National Disciplinary Committee to ANC Youth League leaders were upheld by an appeals committee on Saturday.
However, the embattled leadership was granted leave to argue in mitigation of their suspensions, the National Disciplinary Committee of Appeals (NDCA) announced at Luthuli House.
“The matter will be referred back to the national disciplinary committee (NDC)... the hearing must be conducted within 14 days,” NDCA chairman Cyril Ramaphosa said.
This meant that youth league leader Julius Malema and his spokesman Floyd Shivambu were suspended with immediate effect and stripped of their titles.
The NDC last year found Malema guilty of provoking serious divisions in the league's parent body, the ANC, and bringing that organisation into disrepute.
Malema had said the league would send a team to Botswana to consolidate local opposition parties and help bring about regime change.
Charged with him were Shivambu, deputy president Ronald Lamola, treasurer general Pule Mabe, secretary general Sindiso Magaqa and deputy secretary general Kenetswe Mosenogi. - Sapa
