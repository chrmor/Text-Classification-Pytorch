Libya: aid ship cuts short mission in Misurata after coming under fire
At least four people, including a woman and two children, were killed after the Red Star One sailed into the besieged city's port on its sixth relief mission.
Over 1,000 foreign workers waiting to be evacuated were forced to flee as shells landed in the camp where they had been sheltering in recent days.
The vessel, carrying 180 tons of aid, had already been forced to anchor out at sea for five days after pro-Gaddafi forces mined the approaches to the rebel-held city.
But the ship was forced to pull up its ramp within an hour of docking as shells rained down on the port with only 800 foreign workers and wounded civilians on board -- 200 fewer than the aid agency behind the mission, the International Organisation for Migration, had hoped.
Hundreds of Libyan civilians braved the shells as they jostled for a space on the boat only to be turned away as the ship fled for safety.
"We did our best and took everyone we could in a very short time, including Libyan women and children whose relatives have been wounded," said Othman Belbeisi, the agency's team leader on the Red Star One.
Andrew Mitchell, the International Development Secretary, said the deliberate attempts to prevent humanitarian relief reaching Misurata were "unacceptable".
"I strongly condemn the fact that humanitarian vessels are being prevented from carrying out their duties," he said. "We demand unfettered humanitarian access so that this urgent work can be continued."
