Vikings' Adrian Peterson reinstated, NFL says
Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson has been reinstated, effective April 17, the NFL said in a statement Thursday. 
"Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings was advised today that effective tomorrow he is reinstated as an active NFL player and may participate in all scheduled activities with the Vikings," the NFL statement said. 
The All-Pro running back was indicted last September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier in 2014 in suburban Houston. The case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools.
Peterson avoided jail time in November in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors to resolve his child abuse case. The plea deal reduced the felony charge to a misdemeanor.
"I truly regret this incident. I take full responsibility for my actions," Peterson told reporters after accepting the plea deal. "I'm just glad this is over and I can put this behind me."
Commissioner Roger Goodell sent Peterson a letter advising him of his reinstatement. Goodell wrote that Peterson will have to fulfill all the obligations of his plea deal with authorities.
Goodell also told Peterson he would have to continue attending counseling while adhering to the league's new personal conduct policy to avoid further discipline.
Peterson has said he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas. The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and on one of his testicles, according to court records.
Peterson's agent has said the star running back wants to play elsewhere next season. But the Vikings say they have no plans to trade him.
