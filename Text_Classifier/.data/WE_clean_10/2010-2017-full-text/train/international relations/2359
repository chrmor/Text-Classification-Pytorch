(LEAD) 27 N. Koreans repatriated by sea
SEOUL, March 27 (Yonhap) -- Twenty-seven North Koreans were repatriated to their communist nation Sunday, 50 days after their wooden boat drifted across the western border into South Korea, Seoul officials said. They are among 31 North Koreans -- 11 men and 20 women -- who strayed across the Yellow Sea border into South Korean waters on Feb. 5. They sought to be repatriated, while the other four expressed hope to remain in the South.
