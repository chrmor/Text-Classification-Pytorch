Israeli President Reuven Rivlin says the Pew study brings up troubling challenges that need to be dealt with immediately. The finding that 48 percent of Jewish Israelis believe Arabs should be transferred out of Israel is particularly troubling to Rivlin. MK Yousef Jabareen, chair of the Knesset Lobby for Jewish-Arab Coexistence, said, "The transfer of citizens, for whatever reason, is a crime against humanity, and I am frightened to see that half of those polled support such a step." Human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International Israel and the Anne Lindh Foundation's Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality in Israel, denounced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the results of the study.
