Gold Extends 3-Month Low as Dollar Turns Higher
NEW YORKâ€”Gold futures gave up earlier gains, settling at a fresh three-month low on Wednesday as a stronger U.S. dollar sapped investor appetite for the metal.
Gold for December delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell $3.20, or 0.3%, to $1,245.30 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close since June 4.
