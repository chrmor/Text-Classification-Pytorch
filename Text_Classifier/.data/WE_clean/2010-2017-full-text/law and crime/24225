Muammar Gaddafi’s Son Hannibal Kidnapped in Lebanon: Reports
The son of former Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi was reportedly kidnapped in Lebanon.
Al-Jadeed TV broadcast a video of the younger Gaddafi, and it uploaded it on YouTube.
The BBC reported that Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi, 40, was kidnapped in Lebanon. The network cited security forces in the country.
He appeared in a video aired late Friday on local Al-Jadeed TV saying anyone who has information about Imam Moussa al-Sadr should come forward.
Gaddafi appeared to have been beaten up and had black eyes but said in the video he is “in good health, happy and relaxed.”
It was not clear when Gaddafi, who is married to a Lebanese woman, was kidnapped.
The AFP news agency reported that it might have been carried out by the Lebanese Amal Movement.
He fled with his wife, Aline Skaf, from Libya to Algeria after Libyan rebels entered Tripoli during the Libyan civil war in 2011. He left there to go to Oman in 2012. He was known for his lavish lifestyle. His wife was accused of severely abusing an Ethiopian maid–who was later found by rebels after the Gaddafi family fled the country–by throwing boiling water on her.
Under his father’s regime, Hannibal was a consultant to a Libyan maritime transport company. He was known as a “playboy” with a bad temper. In 2001, he reportedly attacked three Italian police officers with a fire extinguisher.
