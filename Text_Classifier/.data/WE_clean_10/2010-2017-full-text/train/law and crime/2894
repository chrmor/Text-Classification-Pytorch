Lawyer in Iran stoning case asks for asylum in Norway
Iranian lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei, who has been defending a woman facing death by stoning in Iran, has sought asylum in Norway.
Mr Mostafaei said he had fled Iran last week fearing arrest, firstly reaching Turkey by car, horseback and on foot.
One of Mr Mostafaei's clients is Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, sentenced to death by stoning for adultery.
Her case has sparked international outrage and the sentence has been suspended pending a review.
Mr Mostafaei said he had been called in for questioning by the Iranian authorities and then told to return for more questioning.
When he failed to do so, he said the authorities jailed his wife Fereshteh and her brother to pressure him to return.
But Mr Mostafaei fled on 24 July, saying his wife would not have forgiven him if he had turned himself in.
Mr Mostafaei said his wife had been freed on Saturday and he hoped she would join him in Norway.
But he told Reuters news agency: "We remain concerned and focused on the fate of other human rights defenders inside Iran, and obviously their clients."
Mr Mostafaei said he regretted leaving his clients behind.
"I've lost the ability to work on behalf of my clients. That means I've lost everything. Without that, it doesn't matter whether I'm in heaven or hell."
Ashtiani's death sentence has been temporarily halted by judiciary head Sadeq Larijani.
However, she may still be executed by hanging.
