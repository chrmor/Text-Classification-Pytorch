Highlights: Michigan Results Loom Large as 2016 Race Advances
Four states held contests to choose presidential nominees Tuesday, with voters in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii casting votes.
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton scored two early wins in Mississippi. But Bernie Sanders narrowly took the big prize by winning Michigan in a late night nail-biter as Trump handily won the state's GOP primary. Late in the evening, Ted Cruz won the Idaho Republican primary and Trump won the Hawaii GOP caucus when the returns came in overnight.
