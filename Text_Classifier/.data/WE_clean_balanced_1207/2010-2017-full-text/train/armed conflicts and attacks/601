Belgium-born French national sought in Paris terror attacks
Paris (CNN)Authorities are hunting for a Belgium-born French national who's one of three brothers suspected in the Paris terror attacks.
Belgian and French officials want to know where Salah Abdeslam is, and Belgium has issued an international warrant for him.
French police released his photo and warned people not to interact with him, saying that he is dangerous.
Salah Abdeslam is suspected of being involved in the attacks.
Investigators haven't said much about how they believe Abdeslam is tied to Friday's series of shootings and explosions in the French capital.
Jean-Pascal Thoreau, a spokesman for Belgium's Federal Prosecutor, said Abdeslam is one of three brothers suspected of involvement in the attacks. One of the brothers was killed in the attacks, and another was arrested by Belgian police, Thoreau said.
The senator told CNN that the man was carrying a fake or doctored Syrian passport, and also a registration document for refugee status issued by Greek authorities. The fingerprints taken by Greek authorities match those of the terrorist who blew himself up at the Stade de France, the senator said.
