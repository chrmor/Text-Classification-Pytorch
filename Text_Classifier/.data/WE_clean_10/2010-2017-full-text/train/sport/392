Final round coverage
The presentation ceremony is happening at Augusta. Organisers take a small lifetime in acknowledging and reading out the contributions of various golf associations from across the world (yes, Taiwan, Mexico - they all get a mention!) Jordan Spieth is impressively composed and humble with his victory speech. He leaves little doubt that now that he has one green jacket, he also wants another one. The 21-year-old thanks his family, friends and his caddy. Spieth also shows he has a touch of humour, referring to his receding hairline. "There's a reason why I have a hair-line like this, because it's stressful what we do," he says.
