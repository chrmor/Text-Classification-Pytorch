New Syrian Forces turned over coalition-issued equipment to Nusra Front -U.S.
WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - New Syrian Forces gave the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front six pickup trucks and ammunition that had been supplied by the U.S.-led coalition, the U.S. military said in a statement on Friday.
"If accurate, the report of NSF members providing equipment to al Nusra Front is very concerning and a violation of Syria train-and-equip program guidelines," U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said in a statement.
The New Syrian Forces turned over the trucks and ammunition in exchange for safe passage through an al Nusra area, the statement said. (Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Sandra Maler)
