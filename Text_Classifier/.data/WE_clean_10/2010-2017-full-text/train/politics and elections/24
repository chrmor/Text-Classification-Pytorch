Nigeria inaugurates new cabinet
Nigeria's acting President Goodluck Jonathan has sworn in members of his new cabinet.
A senior executive at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, Olusegun Aganga, has been appointed finance minister.
Only 13 of the 38 new cabinet members are from the dissolved government, Reuters reports.
The inauguration follows a power vacuum which saw Mr Jonathan assume executive powers after President Umaru Yar'Adua fell ill in November 2009.
Mr Jonathan has placed former Mines Minister Deziani Allison-Madueke in charge of the country's oil ministry, a key post in the oil-rich state.
Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga is seen as a reformer, expected to back efforts for greater transparency and the fight against corruption, says the BBC's Caroline Duffield in Lagos.
With the new cabinet, Mr Jonathan is getting rid of nearly all of the people that Nigerians call "the cabale", our correspondent says.
They were President Yar'Adua's closest friends, who fought a vicious battle to keep him in office even when he was too sick to sign his own name, she adds.
That circle is now being swept away and the acting president is bringing in people loyal to him, our correspondent says.
Mr Jonathan has outlined his main priorities as electoral reforms, security in the oil-producing Niger Delta, providing a more reliable power supply and fighting corruption.
In March, Mr Jonathan dissolved the entire cabinet and made new nominations, most of which were accepted by Nigeria's senate last week.
The new cabinet is expected to remain in place until elections due next year.
These are due in April but could be held in January.
President Umaru Yar'Adua has not been seen in public since he fell ill in November 2009.
