Algeria bus crash kills 15 people: report
ALGIERS (Reuters) - A collision between a bus and a truck in Algeria Sunday killed 15 people and injured another 15, state radio reported.
The crash happened on a major highway in the Ghardaia region, in the Sahara desert, the radio report said, quoting emergency services. It said five of the injured were in a serious condition.
In September last year, a collision between two buses in the Medea region of northern Algeria killed 11 people and wounded 65. Road accidents kill about 4,000 people each year in Algeria, a North African country with a population of 35 million people.
