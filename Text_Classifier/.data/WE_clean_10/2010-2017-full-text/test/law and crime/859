Bosnia Arrests Fugitive War Criminal

A Bosnian Serb war criminal, who has been sentenced to 20 years in prison but escaped from jail in 2007, has been arrested in eastern Bosnia, local media cited Bosnian police reports.
Radovan Stankovic, 42, was arrested on Saturday afternoon in the eastern Bosnian town of Foca after neighbors reported a quarrel in an apartment where the criminal was apparently hiding from police.
According to court documents, Stankovic, a member of a Serb paramilitary unit, “took part in, abetted and assisted the capture, torture, rape and murder of non-Serb civilians in the Foca area from April 1992 to February 1993.”
He was convicted of crimes against humanity, rape and enslavement by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006 after his case had been referred to it by the Hague Tribunal for further processing.
In May 2007 Stankovic escaped from a prison convoy on the way to a dentist’s office for a tooth x-ray exam.
His brother, Ranko, was later sentenced to two years in prison for having helped Stankovic escape.
