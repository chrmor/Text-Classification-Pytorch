The National Council for Peace and Order on Tuesday approved a proposal to extend for another three months the executive decree for administration in an emergency situation in three southern border provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, except Pattani's Mae Lan district.
Col Winthai Suvari, an NCPO spokesman, said the extension period is from June 2-Sept 19.
