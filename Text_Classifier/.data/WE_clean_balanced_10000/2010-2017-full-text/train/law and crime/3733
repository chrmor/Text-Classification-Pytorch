Egypt's military suspends sentences of protesters
CAIRO - Egypt's military rulers have suspended the prison sentences of 120 people who participated in protests following the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has also denied using gunfire to break up sit-ins that have continued following Mubarak's Feb. 11 ouster.
The comments, made in a statement late Wednesday, come amid mounting criticism of the military council, which has taken over power. The caretaker rulers have promised democratic elections and other reforms but human rights activists say they continue some of the abuses of Mubarak's regime.
The statement said sentences of up to seven years for the 120 protesters will be reduced to one-year suspended sentences. It is not clear what the protesters were convicted of.
