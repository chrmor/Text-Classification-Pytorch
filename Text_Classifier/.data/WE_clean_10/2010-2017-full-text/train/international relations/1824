Dutch freeze contacts with Iran over hanging
The Dutch government has frozen all contacts with Iran in protest over the hanging of a Dutch-Iranian woman.
The Dutch foreign ministry said it was "shocked, shattered by this act by a barbaric regime".
Sahra Bahrami, aged 46, was hanged for drug smuggling early on Saturday, Iranian officials said.
Her family accuses Tehran of fabricating the case against her after she was detained for taking part in anti-government protests in 2009.
The Dutch foreign ministry announced the freeze in all contacts with Iran on Saturday.
"This concerns all official contacts between diplomats and civil servants," spokesman Bengt van Loosdrecht told the AFP news agency.
Any meetings or contacts with the Iranians now must have prior written approval.
The ministry also advised all dual Dutch-Iranian nationals against travelling to Iran, saying that Dutch consular officials would now have no access to them if they needed any assistance.
Sahra Bahrami's execution brings the total number hanged in Iran so far this year to 66, according to media reports.
