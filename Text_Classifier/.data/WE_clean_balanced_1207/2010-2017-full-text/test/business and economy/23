TransAsia Airways of Taiwan Closing After 2 Deadly Crashes
HONG KONG — TransAsia Airways, the Taiwan-based airline that had two fatal crashes within seven months of each other, said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday that it was shutting down.
Its shares and flights had been suspended since Monday.
The company has continuously lost money, and its shares have been sliding since the crashes in 2014 and 2015 raised questions about the safety of its planes.
In July 2014, one of its planes hit a building while landing in stormy weather in the Penghu Islands, about 30 miles west of Taiwan’s main island. Forty-eight people were killed.
Another plane crashed into the Keelung River in Taiwan in February 2015, killing at least 35 people. The pilot of that plane acknowledged later that he had shut off the wrong engine, according to a report on the crash. The report also said that he had failed a simulator test the previous year but passed a makeup exam.
