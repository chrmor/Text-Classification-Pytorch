Turkish Airlines Jet Skids Off Runway, Passengers Escape to Safety
A Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog in the Nepalese capital Wednesday skidded off a slippery runway, but there were no serious injuries, officials said.
The plane, Flight TK726, was carrying 238 people and coming from Istanbul when the accident happened.
The airline released a statement following the incident, stating that one passenger was slightly injured and taken to a hospital for treatment.
“The technical examination will determine the cause of the incident,” the statement read.
The runway was slippery after two days of rain and there was dense fog at the time. The plane was stuck in the grass and there was some damage to the front of the Airbus 330.
The plane circled for half an hour over Nepal before making a second attempt to land. The airport -- Nepal’s only international airport -- remained closed Wednesday morning after the accident.
