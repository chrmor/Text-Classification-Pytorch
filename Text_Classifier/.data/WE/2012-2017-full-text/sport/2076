David Nalbandian investigated by police after line judge injury
Police are investigating a complaint of alleged assault against David Nalbandian, who was disqualified from the Aegon Championships final after a line judge was injured.
He was leading Marin Cilic 7-6 (7-3) 3-4 when he kicked a panel in front of Andrew McDougall's seat, injuring him.
Umpire Fergus Murphy awarded the match to Cilic despite boos from the crowd.
Nalbandian apologised at the time and has since been fined the maximum penalty of £6,400 by the ATP.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: "We are aware of an incident at the Aegon Championships on June 17.
"A complaint has been made and the Metropolitan Police Service is now investigating. The allegation is of assault."
The incident happened after Nalbandian missed a lunging forehand in the second set.
He kicked an advertising hoarding, which flew off its hinges and struck McDougall in the shin, causing a large gash.
McDougall received immediate treatment from St John Ambulance and saw the tournament medical team.
Nalbandian told the 6,000-capacity crowd: "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court."
He was deemed guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct and his £36,500 prize money was also withdrawn.
