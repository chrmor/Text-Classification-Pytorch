Boomtown Rats re-form for Isle of Wight festival
Bob Geldof says it's the right time to 'go back to Boomtown' as his band announce their first show since 1986
The Boomtown Rats are to re-form. Bob Geldof's band will perform at the Isle of Wight festival, playing together for the first time since 1986.
"Playing again with the Rats and doing those great songs again will be exciting afresh," said Geldof. "We were an amazing band and I just feel it's the right time to re-Rat, to go back to Boomtown for a visit."
The festival, which runs from 13-16 June, features headline performances from the Stone Roses, the Killers and Bon Jovi. Other artists on the bill include Paul Weller, Emeli Sandé, Jake Bugg and the Maccabees.
Geldof said that the Isle of Wight festival appealed for the band's comeback because he'd "always fancied playing [there], ever since I hitched there in the good/bad days when I was a kid. I saw the Who, Doors (I think), Hendrix and Leonard Cohen, who incidentally blew Hendrix off the stage … I also told several very boring frog anarchist types to go and fuck themselves and then stayed for a night in Hawkwind's tent. That's pretty IOW."
The Boomtown Rats formed in 1975 in Dublin, going on to have a string of hit singles. They are best known for their song I Don't Like Mondays, which went to No 1 in 1979. Isle of Wight promoter John Giddings said: "It's great they have chosen the Isle of Wight festival as their reunion. Our audience will love them, their catalogue is classic … "
