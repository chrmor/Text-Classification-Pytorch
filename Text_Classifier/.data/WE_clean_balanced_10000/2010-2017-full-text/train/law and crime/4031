Vigil for US student
Rutgers University in the US has held a silent vigil to remember a student who committed suicide after his sexual encounter with a man in his dormitory room was secretly streamed online.
The tribute on Sunday night to 18-year-old freshman Tyler Clementi drew a few hundred people, many holding candles, to the school's campus in New Brunswick.
While some area religious officials briefly addressed the crowd during the hour-long vigil, few words were spoken by the participants. Most in attendance took the time to reflect on what had happened to Clementi, sharing hugs and holding hands with others in a show if unity.
Among those attending was Rutgers student Julie Burg, who said she wanted to spread the message that help is available for students in crisis.
"There are many groups anywhere you go to that could help support you," Burg told WCBS-TV in New York.
Burg was joined at the vigil by her mother, Annmarie Burg, who was saddened by the events leading to Clementi's death.
