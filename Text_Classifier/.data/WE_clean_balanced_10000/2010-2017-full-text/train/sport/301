Chan Yuen-ting becomes first woman to manage in men's continental top-flight competition
A Chinese coach has made history by becoming the first woman to manage a men's team in a top-flight continental competition.
Chan Yuen-ting, who lifted the Hong Kong Premier League title as boss of Eastern Sports Club last season, managed her side in an Asian Champions League match on Wednesday.
Her team could not quite live up to the occasion however - they were hammered 7-0.
She faced up against Luiz Felipe Scolari - a World Cup-winning coach with Brazil - and his Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande.
Chan became the first woman to coach a men's professional team to a top division title when they won the Hong Kong Premier League in 2015-16.
They lost only once in 15 matches after she took over in December 2015 to become first female coach in the league.
Chan previously worked as a data analyst for Hong Kong Pegasus before taking over as assistant coach at the club.
