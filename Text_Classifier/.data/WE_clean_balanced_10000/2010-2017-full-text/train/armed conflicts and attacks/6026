Saudi jets kill six Pakistani sailors off Yemen coast
SANAA: Six Pakistani sailors were reportedly killed in a Saudi air strike targeting their boat off the Yemeni coast, Press TV reported Monday.
The Saudi air raid targeted the boat which was carrying 12 Pakistani sailors off Mukha coast in the Yemeni province of Ta’izz Sunday. According to the report, the other six sailors were still unaccounted for. The deadly raid comes as Riyadh continues its military campaign against neighbouring Yemen, launched in March 2015 to reinstall the former Yemeni government. 
Yemen’s former president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi has ordered a major assault on the country’s Red Sea coast against Houthi Ansarullah fighters and allied army forces, who have been defending the nation against a deadly Saudi offensive. Reports Sunday said Saudi warplanes had intensified their air raids on the province of Ta’izz, which has witnessed heavy fighting on the ground between pro-Hadi militants and Yemeni armed forces in recent days.
