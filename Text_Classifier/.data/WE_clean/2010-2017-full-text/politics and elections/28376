Prem becomes Regent pro tempore
Privy Council president Prem Tinsulanonda has been named Regent pro tempore following the passing of His Majesty the King on Thursday, NLA vice-president Peerasak Porjit said on Friday.
Gen Prem's appointment is in line with the constitution, which states that the council president is acting regent when the throne is vacant, according to Section 24.
"Pending the proclamation of the name of the Heir or the Successor to the Throne under Article 23, the President of the Privy Council shall be Regent pro tempore," the constitution says.
The duty of the Regent pro tempore ends when a meeting of the National Legislative Assembly (NLA) invites the heir to ascend the throne, according to Section 23.
The NLA vice-president said the NLA meeting on Thursday evening was held under Section 2 of the interim constitution which the cabinet should have submitted the heir name for acknowledgment. Then the NLA chairman would invite the heir to step on the throne.
However, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha informed the NLA on Thursday that the heir, HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, would like to take some time to grieve with the nation before accepting the invitation to become the new king.
Therefore, a regent pro tempore is needed during this transition period. Mr Peerasak said the Privy Council president would automatically take that position.
Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam also confirmed on Friday night that the Privy Council president has been named the regent.
Gen Prem was prime minister for eight years from 1980.
