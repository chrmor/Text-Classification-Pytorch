The Cass County Sheriff’s Office released a photo of the victim’s car from the shooting incident on Interstate 49 that happened on Labor Day. 
Investigators shut down and searched a section of a Cass County interstate Tuesday after the shooting seriously injured a father and his young child.
There was a temporary lane closure of Interstate 49 north near North Cass Parkway for over an hour about 3 p.m. as they looked for possible evidence in the case.
“We brought the canines back out. We’re hoping to find some additional evidence,” said Cass County Sheriff’s Maj. Jeff Weber.
It was a painstaking process trying to find evidence because of the location and conditions.
“A lot of traffic moving, the grass is tall, the dogs get overheated, so any evidence could help at this time,” Weber said.
This comes after a family of four was on a rather empty stretch of the highway when another car pulled up behind them early Monday morning, and they allowed it to pass.
"When it passed them, it then slowed and pulled alongside on the passenger side. The suspect vehicle then fired multiple rounds into the victim's vehicle," Weber said.
The 32-year-old father and one of his children, a 2-year-old girl, were hit by the gunfire.
The man's wife drove to them to the hospital about 12:30 a.m. where her husband and little girl are still recovering and listed in stable condition. The mother and another child were uninjured.
The incident may have been sparked by the victims flashing their high beams at the shooter’s car after they were passed.
Deputies are now they're trying to find the gunman on the loose.
During the initial investigation at the scene deputies found broken glass on the interstate in the area described by the victims.  Another search of the area with K-9 revealed spent shell casings believed to be evidence.  Investigators also processed the victim’s car for evidence.  The photo shows that the vehicle was hit a minimum of 13 times by the suspect as it drove along side.
"It is serious, and it is concerning for anyone who travels on the roadway I think we've all experienced that with recent activities, or crimes that have occurred in Cass County and across the area, across the state," Weber said.
Evidence collected from the scene and the victim’s vehicle has been sent to an area crime lab for testing.
The sheriff’s office has released more information on the suspect’s car. They said they’re looking for a black four-door early to mid-2000’s Ford Focus. They haven’t released a suspect description yet.
Investigators are still asking for anyone with information about the case or may have been driving on I-49 between Peculiar and Belton to call the KC CrimeStoppers Tips Hotline at 816-474-TIPS.
