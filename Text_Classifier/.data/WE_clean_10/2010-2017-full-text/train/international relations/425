North Korea nuclear H-bomb test claims provoke scepticism and condemnation – as it happened
Beijing formally protested, expressed concern over radioactive fallout in areas bordering North Korea, and indicated it would support new, punitive UN security council action as demanded by South Korea, among others. Maybe Beijing’s undisguised wrath will give Kim Jong-un pause. But maybe not. In a deliberate poke in the eye for China’s leaders, he failed to inform them of the test in advance. Kim has refused to rejoin the Chinese-led six-party nuclear talks. In September, hesnubbed President Xi Jinping’s invitationto attend celebrations marking the end of the second world war.
In fact, Kim has never visited his Chinese ally A visit to Pyongyang last October by Liu Yunshan, a senior Chinese party official, suggested relations were warming up. Now Kim has slammed the door again.
In truth, China has less leverage over Pyongyang, both politically and in terms of trade and oil supplies, than is commonly believed. So perhaps the boyish Kim, self-styled “Supreme Leader”, does not really care what “Big Daddy” Xi wants.
Or perhaps – a more alarming thought – Kim does not know what he is doing. Conventional diplomatic wisdom suggests China will not break with North Korea’s regime for fear of internal collapse, a refugee crisis, and a US-South Korean takeover. But there is more than one way to skin a cat. Tough bilateral Chinese sanctions in addition to UN measures are one option, plus a halt to Chinese aid, investment and joint projects. If China does not act, it is unclear who will.
