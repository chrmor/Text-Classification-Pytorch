Qantas shares recover on A380 comeback
Shares in Qantas Airways have recovered to after the carrier said its fleet of A380 superjumbos will start returning to service by the end of this week.
The stock ended up 1 cent at $2.64 after climbing as high as $2.66 in late morning trade. It had been down 2 cents at $2.61 just before the chief executive made the announcement.
‘‘We are completely comfortable with the operation of the aircraft,’’ chief executive Alan Joyce told journalists on Tuesday.
Mr Joyce said the planes would start flying again from Saturday, November 27. The carrier’s six A380s were grounded earlier this month.
The planes were grounded on November 4, after QF32 flying from Singapore to Sydney suffered an explosion in one of its four engines over the Indonesian island of Batam.
Qantas engineers then began investigations into all of the Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines on the aircraft.
