Wounded Warrior Project’s Board Fires Top Two Executives
The Wounded Warrior Project ousted its top two executives Thursday after accusations of lavish spending and financial irregularities by the charity.
The group’s chief executive, Steven Nardizzi, and its chief operating officer, Al Giordano, were fired by the nonprofit organization’s board of directors, according to a news release from the board distributed by Abernathy MacGregor, a crisis-management public-relations firm hired by the charity.
Mr. Nardizzi and Mr. Giordano were instrumental in building the organization into a fund-raising juggernaut that took in more than $372 million in 2015.
But the leadership came under fire after former employees said the charity spent recklessly and became overly focused on fund-raising at the expense of veterans’ programs. Mr. Nardizzi was given $473,000 in compensation in 2014. A staff meeting at a five-star hotel in Colorado, in which he rappelled into a crowd, cost nearly $1 million.
