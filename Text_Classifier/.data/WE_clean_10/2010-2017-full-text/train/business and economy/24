Airport Melee Follows Latest Dispute Between Airline and Its Pilots
Passengers at an airport in Florida protested on Monday night after the cancellation of multiple flights, leading to a confrontation with airline employees and sheriff’s deputies who arrested three travelers while attempting to restore order.
According to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, the arrests were made after customers screamed at and threatened Spirit Airline employees, inciting unrest in a crowd of about 500 people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
Their anger was set off by the flight cancellations, the sheriff’s office said in a statement, and deputies were sent in to calm the crowd. Flight Aware, a flight-tracking site, indicated that 11 Spirit Airlines flights were canceled at the airport on Monday and that 30 were delayed.
Arrest reports assert that those detained were threatening to harm airline employees and challenging them to fights. All three of the people who were arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, inciting a riot and resisting arrest.
