Libya justice minister resigns to protest 'excessive use of force' against protesters -  Haaretz - Israel News
Libyan Justice Minister Mustafa Mohamed Abud Al Jeleil resigned Monday to protest the "the excessive use of violence against government protesters," the privately-owned Quryna newspaper reported.
The newspaper said on its internet site it had spoken to the minister by telephone. There was no immediate official confirmation of the resignation.
Al-Jleil was the fourth Libyan official to resign in less than 24 hours, joining the country's ambassadors to the Arab League, India and China. He was also the highest-ranking official to do so.
More than 200 people have been killed since the unrest began in Libya seven days. Demonstrators who took to the streets demanding President Moammer Gadhafi step down have been met with a crackdown by security forces loyal to the long-time leader.
The clashes began in the eastern city of Benghazi, where tens of thousands of protesters seemed to have taken control by late Sunday, after 50 people were killed in a single day.
The demonstrations spread to Tripoli later that night, after Gadhafi's son went on state television to proclaim that his father remained in charge with the army's backing and would fight until "the last man, the last woman, the last bullet."
The protests and violence seen Monday were the heaviest yet in the capital. "The city on Monday was shut down and streets empty, with schools, government offices and most shops closed except a few bakeries serving residents hunkered down in their houses," a witness said.
Libya has seen the bloodiest crackdown of any Arab country on the wave of protests sweeping the region that toppled the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia. Â
