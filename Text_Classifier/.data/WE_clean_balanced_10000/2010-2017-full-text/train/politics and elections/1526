Johannesburg - Riot police clashed with protesters in Soweto on Saturday shortly before a visit by US President Barack Obama, a Reuters photographer said.
Armed police fired stun grenades to disperse the crowd of several hundred protesters, who had gathered outside the Soweto campus of the University of Johannesburg, where Obama was due to address a town hall meeting with students.
AFP reported that at least three bangs were heard as police tried to move the demonstrators away from a university campus.
Police spokesperson Sally de Beer told Sapa that about 120 protestors gathered about 400m from the gates to the campus.
The group were allowed permission to protest, but only until 14:00.
"When their time lapsed at 14:00, they refused to comply with a request to disperse as they were required to... the police fired one stun grenade and they then dispersed," de Beer said.
De Beer said: "We totally respect everyone's right to demonstrate peacefully, but if they are required in terms of their permission to protest, they must stick to the requirements."
