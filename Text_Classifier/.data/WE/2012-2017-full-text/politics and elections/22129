'Calexit' supporters to take another shot at securing California independence
Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that she has no plans to run for office again, but she plans to remain involved in civic life, particularly helping the Democrats' efforts to regain control of the House in 2018.
“I'm not going anywhere,” Clinton said at the annual Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes. “I have a big stake in what happens in this country. I am very unbowed and unbroken about what happened because I don’t want it to happen to anybody else. I don't want it to happen to the values and the institutions I care about in America.
“And I think we’re at a really pivotal point,” she said. “And therefore I'm going to keep writing and keep talking and keep supporting people who are on the front lines of the resistance."
