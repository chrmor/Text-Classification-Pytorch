China pressures Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen to acknowledge One China
China has threatened to cut off regular communication with Taiwan unless the country's new president acknowledges the so-called One China principle.
According to a report from Xinhua, the Chinese state media outlet, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said on Saturday that only by Taiwan confirming the One China principle - which dictates that the island of Taiwan and mainland China are parts of a single Chinese state - could "cross-Strait affairs authorities continue regular communication."
Ma said the Chinese and Taiwanese authorities had had active interactions since at least 2014 through a hotline and other means, after establishing a regular mechanism that was based on a political agreement called the 1992 consensus.
Ma said the communications arrangement had allowed the countries "to contact each other in a timely fashion, avoid misjudgments, keep disagreements under control, and it was also conducive to enhancing understanding and mutual trust."
"With the operation of the regular communication mechanism, some 'impossibilities' in cross-Strait relations have become realities," Ma said, according to the Xinhua report.
