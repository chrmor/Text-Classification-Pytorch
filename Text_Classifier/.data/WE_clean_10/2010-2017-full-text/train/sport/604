Women's baseball worlds suspended after shooting
The women's baseball World Cup in Venezuela has been suspended a day after a player was stuck by a stray bullet during a game.
The International Baseball Federation says the teams are safely back in their hotels after Hong Kong's Cheuk Woon Yee was hit in a game Friday against the Netherlands in a stadium at the Fort Tiuna military base. It wasn't clear from where the bullet was fired.
The bullet struck Cheuk as she was taking the field to play third base in the top of the fourth inning against the Netherlands on Friday, and was lodged in her left calf, Venezuela's information ministry said. It said Cheuk was in good condition.
Venezuela sports minister Hector Rodriguez said a revised schedule would soon be announced. Officials of the International Baseball Federation weren't immediately available to comment.
Gun violence is common in the hillside slums near the base and is a serious problem in many areas of Venezuela, which is among the most violent countries in Latin America.
The IBAF says that the Venezuelan government has guaranteed the safety of all 11 teams in the tournament.
Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Venezuela are in Pool A. Cuba, defending champion Japan, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the United States are in Pool B.
