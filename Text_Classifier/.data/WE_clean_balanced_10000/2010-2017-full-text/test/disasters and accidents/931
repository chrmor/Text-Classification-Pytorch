Indonesia Air Force Plane Crash: Brazilian-Made Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano Crashes Into House, 2 Dead
Two people on board an Indonesian air force plane were killed after it crashed into a house Wednesday on the country’s main island of Java, an official said, according to the Associated Press (AP). The official added that one woman who was inside the house was critically injured.
The Brazilian-made Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano light attack plane was on a routine training flight when it came down close to the Abdul Rahman Saleh air force base, Maj. Hamdi Londong, the spokesman for the base, reportedly said.
The base is located in Malang, a hilly town in East Java province, about 530 miles east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta. Londong reportedly said that the two pilots died instantly. However, earlier reports said that the two pilots had ejected safely.
The woman who was injured in the incident is currently being treated at a hospital.
Londong told the AP that an investigation team has been sent to the site to determine the cause of the crash.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident, four military personnel were killed Wednesday in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw after their utility aircraft crashed after taking off from the airport. The aircraft — a Beech 1900, a 19-passenger twin-engine turboprop — crashed in a rice field about a mile from the airport. One military personnel on board the plane survived the crash, the AP reported, citing officials.
