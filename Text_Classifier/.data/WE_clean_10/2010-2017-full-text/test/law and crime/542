10:52 p.m.: Authorities said they know the identity of the shooter but are withholding it so as not to "affect the integrity" of the investigation.
10:45 p.m.: He is a 58-year-old white male who was a theater patron fired multiple shots, said Col. Michael Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police. The shooter was acting alone and is deceased, he said. There were about 100 people inside at the time.
A man opened fire inside a movie theater in a Lafayette, Louisiana, multiplex, Thursday night, killing two people and wounding seven others -- before taking his own life.
"There's nothing to believe that there was any kind of motive," said Col. Michael Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police.
The shooter was a 58-year-old white man who was a theater patron, police said. Authorities have his name but are withholding it as the investigation continues.
The shooting took place shortly before 8:30 p.m ET at the Grand Theatre 16 in Lafayette, a city of about 120,000 people, 60 miles west of Baton Rouge.
About 100 people were inside the theater for a screening of the comedy, "Trainwreck," when the shooter began firing using a handgun, police said.
"I almost thought it was part of the movie at first," he said of the gunshots.
An alarm went off, followed by an overhead intercom message asking patrons to get out.
"Immediately we get terrified because they are telling us to head out to vehicles," he said. "It was kinda like a war going on ... gunshots after gunshots."
"I saw people bleeding from the leg, they were shot," she said. "And I was like 'Wow.' It was like a movie itself."
The extent of those who were injured range from critical to non-life threatening, he said.
Bomb squads conducted a sweep of the theater and the parking lot. Police temporarily closed a nearby Grand theater and deployed officers to other movie houses as a precaution.
"Whenever we hear about these senseless acts of violence, it makes us both furious and sad at the same time," said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, from the scene of the shooting.
"This is an awful night for Lafayette, this is an awful night for Louisiana, this is an awful night for the United States. But we will get through this."
On July 19, 2012, Holmes opened fire during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" using an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one .40 caliber handgun. The shooting stopped with Holmes' arrest outside the theater about seven minutes after the first 911 calls were made to police.
Authorities will put together a profile on the shooter, search his house and trace the gun, said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin.
For now, said Gov. Jindal, "we can pray.
"We can hug these families. We can shower them with love, thoughts and prayers."
