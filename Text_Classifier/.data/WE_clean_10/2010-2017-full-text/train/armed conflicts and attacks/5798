Clinton Says Egypt Must Listen to People
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, trying to stay ahead of rapidly shifting events in Egypt, called on the Egyptian government to restrain its security forces from violence and stressed that the U.S. wants “to partner with the Egyptian people” as well as its government in furthering political and economic reforms in the world’s largest Arab nation.
“People in the Middle East, like people everywhere, are seeking a chance to contribute and have a role in decisions that will shape their lives,” Ms. Clinton said at the State Department after meeting with the foreign minister of Colombia. “Leaders need to respond.”
