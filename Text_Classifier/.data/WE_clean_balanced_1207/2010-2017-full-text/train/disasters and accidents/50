IAF copter crash in Arunachal leaves 12 servicemen dead
NEW DELHI: Twelve military personnel, including three officers, were killed when their Mi-17 helicopter crashed near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh on Friday just after noon. After an major dip in the crash rate around 2003-2006, military aircraft and helicopters have once again begun to go down with alarming regularity, as was reported by TOI earlier this month. In just the last three years, for instance, the armed forces have recorded over 60 crashes, which have killed 45 military personnel as well as five civilians. Friday’s crash occurred just a minute after the medium-lift Mi-17 had got airborne from Tawang helipad, located at an altitude of around 11,000 feet, at 12.05 pm. ‘‘The helicopter was on way to Guwahati. Since the weather was fair, it looks like there was some technical defect. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the exact reason,’’ said a senior IAF officer. The Russian-origin Mi-17 crashed into the hilly terrain in Bomdir area with a loud explosion, killing all the 12 military personnel instantly. Their bodies were later retrieved from the wreckage by an Army detachment located at Tawang. The victims included the two pilots, Flight Lieutenant Akash Yadav and Flight Lieutenant N Rai, and an Army officer, Lt-Colonel M S Nene, who was proceeding on emergency leave due to an illness in his family. Apart from the ageing MiGs and other aircraft, the armed forces have lost well over 70 helicopters in crashes over the last decade. The helicopter fleets of the armed forces, especially the Cheetah and Chetak light-utility helicopters, are clearly ageing. The two main reasons for crashes in IAF are attributed to ‘‘human errors’’ and ‘‘technical defects’’. In other words, ‘‘inadequate’’ training to pilots, ageing machines and shoddy maintenance practices form a deadly mix.
