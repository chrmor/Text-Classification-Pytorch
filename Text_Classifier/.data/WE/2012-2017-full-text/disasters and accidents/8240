Mozambique plane missing with 34 on board
A Mozambique Airlines (LAM) plane with 28 passengers and 6 crew on board has gone missing on a flight to Angola, say airline officials.
Flight TM470 left Mozambique's capital, Maputo, at 11:26 local time (09:26 GMT) and was due to arrive in the Angolan capital, Luanda, at 14:10.
The last contact made with the plane was when it was over northern Namibia.
The airline said there were signs it might have landed near Rundo, northern Namibia, bordering Angola and Botswana.
"LAM airlines, aeronautical and airport authorities are trying to establish contact to confirm the information," said the airline.
Spokesman Norberto Mucopa told the AFP news agency he could not confirm the nationalities of those on board.
Olavi Auanga, police commander of Namibia's Kavango West region - where the plane was last heard from - told AFP patrols were searching the area.
The agency says the region is sparsely populated and covered with wetlands and dense forests.
