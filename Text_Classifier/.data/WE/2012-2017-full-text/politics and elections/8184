Nuclear deal accepts Iran enrichment, cracks sanctions: Rouhani
President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers signalled an acceptance of uranium enrichment in Iran and that punitive sanctions were starting to crumble.
"Iran's right to uranium enrichment on its soil was accepted in this nuclear deal by world powers," he said in a speech broadcast live on state television.
"The structure of the sanctions against Iran has begun to crack," said Rouhani, referring to Western punitive sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme, while adding that the "Iranian nation has never sought nuclear weapons."
