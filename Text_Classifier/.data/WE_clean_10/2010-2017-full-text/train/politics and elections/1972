Heletei appointed Ukrainian defense minister
The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada has appointed Valeriy Heletei defense minister of Ukraine based on the president's recommendation.
Heletei's candidacy was supported by 260 parliamentarians on Thursday.
The newly-appointed defense minister took an oath at the parliamentary rostrum, an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported from the session hall.
The Rada also relieved Mykhailo Koval of his duties as acting defense minister.
Speaking to the parliamentarians after taking the oath, Heletei vowed to do all he can to ensure the safety of Ukrainians, maintain peace and order in the country, and restore Ukraine's territorial integrity.
"I am convinced that Ukraine will win, and trust me, a victory parade will certainly be held in a Ukrainian Sevastopol," Heletei said.
