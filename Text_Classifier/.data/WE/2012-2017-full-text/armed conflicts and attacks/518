Chad rebels rob travellers
Chadian rebels have robbed about 40 people including a local government official of their belongings in attacks in the Central African Republic, police told AFP on Saturday.
FPR rebels loyal to general Baba Ladde attacked the group travelling by taxi, motorcycle or on foot on a road between Ndjoukou and Galafondo in central CAR on Wednesday and Thursday.
“Many were hit when they handed over nothing, then they were searched including their pockets and bags,” police said.
“Among the people was the under-prefect of Ndjoukou” (who was) tied up and thrown into scrubland.
“The rebels took 50 000 CFA francs (76 euros), his clothes and other personal belongings,” the source added.
Chadian and CAR armed forces raided FPR positions in north-central CAR on January 23.
Officials later said that most FPR rebels had fled. CAR military officials said rebel leader Ladde “probably fled” to Sudan. - Sapa-AFP
