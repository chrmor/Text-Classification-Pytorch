Assange: Family fears founder won’t get a fair trial
Julian Assange’s mother and son believe the diplomatic storm caused by the leaking of US diplomatic cables will not afford him a fair trial.
“There’s no fair play here. My son has come forward of his own free will but they have put him in the ring with his hands tied behind his back.”
Mr Assange’s son Daniel has called for his father to be treated “fairly and apolitically” following his arrest in Britain. Mr Assange faces extradition to Sweden to face rape and molestation charges.
Daniel wrote on Twitter: “I can’t see how they can possibly convict him of anything in a fair trial.”
Two women who accuse Mr Assange of sexual misconduct were at first not seeking to bring any charges against him and simply wanted him to take a test for sexually transmitted after they had sex.
US and Sweden have opened talks on extraditing Mr Assange to America to face espionage charges.
Phillip Adams, a member of the WikiLeaks Advisory Board, said yesterday the sex case against Mr Assange was “dubious and shonky”.
He said he could not see why US politicians wanted to prosecute Mr Assange for his latest State Department cable leaks, as he was simply doing what journalists have done for years but on a much larger scale.
“Why the world is so rushing to condemn and to throw around words like ‘treason’, which are clearly inapplicable to a young Australian, astonishes me. I think the reaction around the world is bizarre, absolutely bizarre,” he said.
