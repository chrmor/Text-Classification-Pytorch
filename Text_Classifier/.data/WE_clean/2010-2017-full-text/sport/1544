Nineteen injured in India stadium bridge collapse
NEW DELHI, Sept 21 (Reuters) - At least 19 people were injured when a foot bridge near the main Commonwealth Games stadium collapsed on Tuesday, police said, barely days before the sports event starts, police and witnesses said.
“We have reports of 19 people injured after the entire bridge near gate number three of the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium collapsed,” a police spokesman in the control room said.
Preparations for the Oct 3-14 Games are down to the wire and the event risks descending into farce with construction work still underway. (Reporting by Bappa Majumdar; Editing by Alistair Scrutton)
