Guardian’s Assange Live Q&A Cripples Server
A live Q&A with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on The Guardian’s website appears to have crashed their servers.
A rather plaintive tweet from Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger a few mintues after the 1pm session was supposed to go live reads “Technical difficulties in getting Assange Q+A up. We’re working on best solution.”
Visitors to the site are met by an error page reading “Sorry – we haven’t been able to serve the page you asked for” or else the page does connect, but only very slowly and the page has “Update: we are currently experiencing technical difficulties on guardian.co.uk” across it.
Who would have guessed?
