Boko Haram gunmen kill scores in attacks on Nigerian towns of Kukawa and Musarram
Maiduguri, Nigeria: Islamists from Boko Haram killed 145 people in attacks on two Nigerian villages in recent days, according to residents.
The militants attacked the village of Musarram in the north of Borno state on Tuesday, picking out 48 men and killing them, said Kaka Haruna, a local resident.
In another attack on Wednesday in the town of Kukawa near the border with Niger, 97 people were killed, according to Kakami Idris, a farmer in the area. He said the attack was carried out by more than 50 gunmen who opened fire on people praying after breaking their Ramadan fast.
A former local official in the town of Kukawa near Lake Chad said many had been killed after the suspected Islamist militants attacked in the early evening. A member of a local defence group said the death toll could be as high as 97.
