Pakistan Arrests Two Suspected Suicide Bombers
Pakistani authorities say they have arrested two suspected suicide bombers who were allegedly planning to attack a mosque and government buildings in the capital, Islamabad. Bin Amin, a senior police official in the capital, says authorities are looking for others who may be involved in the alleged plot. He told the Associated Press the men were linked to the Pakistani Taliban in the country's South Waziristan region. The alleged plot was set to be carried out in an exclusive and high security neighborhood in Islamabad, where many foreign embassies, Pakistan's parliament and government ministries are located. The last terrorist attack in Islamabad took place in October 2009, when a suicide bomber killed five U.N. staffers at the Islamabad office of the World Food Program. In September 2008 a massive truck bomb destroyed Islamabad's Marriott Hotel killing at least 60 people.
