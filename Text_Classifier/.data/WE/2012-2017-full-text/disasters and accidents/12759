Gorkha - An official says 250 people are believed missing following a mudslide and avalanche in an isolated village in rural Nepal not far from the epicentre of Saturday's powerful earthquake.
District official Gautam Rimal says heavy snow had been falling on Tuesday near the village, Ghodatabela. He said officials received initial reports of the disaster by phone but then lost contact.
The village, about a 12-hour walk from the nearest town, is along a popular trekking route, but it was not clear if the missing included trekkers.
