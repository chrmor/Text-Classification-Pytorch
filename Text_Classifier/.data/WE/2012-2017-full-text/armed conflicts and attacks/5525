4 militants killed in US drone strike in north-west Pakistan
Four militants were killed when a US drone targeted a vehicle in the lawless North Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan today.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported four persons were killed in the attack by the CIA-operated spy plane in Dattakhel area of North Waziristan Agency.
Officials were quoted by TV news channels as saying that the drone fired two missiles at a vehicle, a short distance from Miranshah, the main town in the region.
North Waziristan is a safe haven for Taliban and al-Qaeda elements.
The attack was carried out at around mid-night. Officials said four drones had been seen flying over the area.
The vehicle was destroyed when two missiles hit it. A UN envoy last week said US drone attacks violated Pakistanâ€™s sovereignty.
Islamabad has described the missile strikes as counter-productive and called on the US to stop them.
