Egyptian prime minister's Gaza visit fails to bring lull in violence

GAZA CITY -- Anyone hoping that Friday morning's visit to Gaza City by Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil might ease the growing conflict between Israel and Hamas was sorely disappointed.
In a brief two-hour trip, Kandil made no public mention of a cease-fire or ending the violence that has so far killed 23 people on both sides.
Instead, he said Egypt’s loyalty rested squarely with Gaza's people.
"The cause of Palestinians is the cause of all Arabs and Muslims,"’ he said during a visit to Shifa Hospital. "Palestinians are heroes."
His presence failed to bring even a temporary lull in the fighting. Though Israel had agreed to halt airstrikes during the visit if militants also held their fire, rockets from Gaza struck Israeli towns almost as soon as Kandil arrived through the Rafah crossing.
