Indonesian police kill six suspected militants in shoot-out outside Jakarta
Indonesian police say six suspected terrorists killed in a shootout overnight had a stash of explosives and links to other small terrorism cells across the country.
Authorities say they had been monitoring a house in South Tangerang, west of Jakarta, for about two weeks.
On Tuesday night they ambushed and killed the alleged leader of the cell and attempted to raid the house.
It seems an explosion foiled their initial attempt to storm in, so for more than nine hours police surrounded the house and exchanged fire with the suspected terrorists.
The country's detective chief, Suhardi Alius, says six terrorists were killed in the raid and six homemade bombs, one which had exploded, were found.
Pistols and mobile phones were also seized.
National police spokesman Boy Rafli has linked the group to a number of other terror cells.
They are accused of involvement in targeted police killings, and planned attacks.
The latest incident comes a day after Australia beefed up its travel advisories to Indonesia, warning of the possibility of attacks on the tourist island of Bali.
More than 6,000 police had been deployed around Jakarta to monitor new year celebrations.
