FAA to Require Recreational Drone Operators to Register
Federal regulators announced Monday that recreational drone operators will be required to register their aircraft.
"There can be no accountability if the person breaking the rules can't be identified," Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a news conference.
A task force of more than two dozen people will be responsible for creating guidelines for the national registry by Nov. 20, with the goal of instilling the program before the end of the holiday season, when around 1 million drones are expected to be sold.
The increased number of recreational drones worries FAA officials and pilots, who have reported seeing twice the number of unmanned aircraft while flying this year than they did during all of 2014. A spate of high-profile incidents — including drones' crashing into the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament and interfering with firefighting efforts in California — has increased pressure to regulate the use of unmanned aircraft.
