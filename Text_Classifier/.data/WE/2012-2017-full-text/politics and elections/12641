Turkey lashes out at pope, EU over Armenia genocide comments
ISTANBUL â€” Turkey was on the defensive Wednesday, lashing out at both Pope Francis and the European Union's legislature for their descriptions of the Ottoman-era killing of Armenians as genocide.
Turkey's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the pontiff has joined "an evil front" plotting against Turkey by describing the killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as "the first genocide of the 20th century."
