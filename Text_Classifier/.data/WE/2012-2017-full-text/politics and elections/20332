Haiti Electoral Council Calls for Calm, Promises Poll Results on Monday PORT-AU-PRINCE � Haiti�s Provisional Election Council has announced that the results of the country�s general elections last Sunday will be declared on Monday next week.The council also called for calm as the polling data is counted, requesting both the public and political parties to wait for the final data and refrain from any actions that could exacerbate rising tensions.Speaking at a press conference Friday, the council�s head Leopold Berlanger stressed that the council is working hard to deliver the results by Monday and is aware that people are waiting but wants to do a good job to prevent another crisis.The political parties and candidates will have the obligation to respect the electoral decree so as not to create a fresh post electoral crisis, Berlanger added.The statements came hours after the two presidential candidates, in letters to the council, denounced the existence of alleged irregularities inside the computing centers.Jude Celestin of the Lapeh party urged the council to be careful in the process of scrutinizing the votes to prevent another post electoral crisis after the one witnessed in 2015.Maryse Narcisse of the Fanmi Lavalas party alleged that many votes from the polling stations in the capital�s Cite Soleil, where she claims to be strong, have not been taken for counting.Since Feb. 15, 2016, a provisional government led by Jocelerme Privert has been running the country following the conclusion of the term of former President Michel Martelly without the election of a successor, leading to a political crisis.
