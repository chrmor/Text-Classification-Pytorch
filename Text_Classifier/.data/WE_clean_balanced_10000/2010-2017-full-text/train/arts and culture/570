Coca Cola Returning to Burma After 60 Years «  VOA Breaking News
Burmese consumers will soon be able to enjoy a bottle of “the real thing.”
Coca-Cola announced Thursday that it is ready to start doing business in Burma for the first time in more than 60 years.
The company said it is waiting for the U.S. government to grant a general license to allow American businesses to invest in Burma — a move it calls imminent. The United States has lifted some sanctions on Burma as the country eases towards democracy.
Coke says it is also making a $3 million grant to support women's economic empowerment and job creation in Burma.
Coke says Burma is one of three countries where it currently does not do business. Cuba and North Korea are the other two.
