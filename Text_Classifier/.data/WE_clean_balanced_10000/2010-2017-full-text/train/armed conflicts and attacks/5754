Israeli warplanes have injured two Palestinians in air raids on the Gaza strip after another spate of rockets fired by Palestinian militants.
The strikes hit two refugee camps - one in central Gaza and one further north.
The Israeli army says one of the strikes was targeting a weapons workshop and the other a base of Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza.
Two people were injured in one of the camps.
The number of rockets fired from Gaza has intensified in recent weeks prompting several retaliatory raids by Israeli forces.
Last month the army chief of staff warned it was just a matter of time before there was another war.
It is two years since Israel's military offensive in Gaza which killed an estimated 1,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and 13 Israelis - 10 of which were soldiers.
