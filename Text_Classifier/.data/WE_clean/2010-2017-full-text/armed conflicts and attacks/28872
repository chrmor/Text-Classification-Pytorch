Syrian Army captures most of key east Aleppo district
DAMASCUS, SYRIA (12:35 P.M.) – The Syrian Arab Army’s “Tiger Forces” have advanced deep inside the strategic Hanano District in the eastern pocket of Aleppo today, capturing a number of sites that were previously under the control of Fatah Halab.
The Tiger Forces began their assault this morning by storming the central sector of Hanano, resulting in a violent battle with the jihadist rebels that is still ongoing at the moment.
According to a military source, the Syrian Armed Forces have once again captured most of Hanano, leaving only a quarter of the district still under the control of Fatah Halab and their allies in east Aleppo.
Meanwhile, south of the Hanano District, the Syrian Arab Army’s Republican Guard forces, alongside Liwaa Suqour Al-Sahra (Desert Hawks Brigade), launched a new attack on ‘Ard Al-Hamra; this resulted in a heated battle at the central sector of this district.
In ‘Ard Al-Hamra’s vicinity, another force from the Republican Guard and Liwaa Al-Quds (Palestinian paramilitary) attempted to seize the Jabal Badro District; however, no gains have been reported thus far.
