Thousands stranded by flash floods in Tas
Thousands of people in eastern Tasmania have been stranded by flash flooding, following record rainfalls in the past 24 hours.
Roads across the east coast were closed on Thursday, including the Tasman Highway - the main thoroughfare of the district - in several places.
The towns of Pyegena, Avoca, Fingal, St Helens, Derby and Gladstone, were the worst affected.
Police had to use a helicopter to rescue a family stranded at a property near Avoca.
The SES, meanwhile had to retrieve two cars as drivers became stuck in the fast rising waters.
It was also warning campers in the region to move their tents to higher ground, with expectations of waters to continue to rise.
