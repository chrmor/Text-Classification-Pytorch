New blast hits nuclear plant as another quake sets off tsunami scare
A second explosion has rocked an earthquake-hit nuclear plant, as Japan struggles to avert a catastrophic reactor meltdown caused by a quake and tsunami feared to have killed more than 10,000.
A new tsunami scare triggered evacuations on the devastated north-east coast after a large wave was spotted rolling in to shore, but authorities said they had detected no sign of a tsunami or a quake that would have caused it.
Japan has been battling to control two overheating reactors at the ageing Fukushima plant after the cooling systems were knocked out by Friday's 8.9-magnitude quake and the resulting tsunami that swallowed up whole towns.
Shortly after Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the plant was still in an "alarming" state, a blast at its No.3 reactor shook the facility and sent plumes of smoke billowing into the sky.
The plant's operator, TEPCO, said that nine people were injured in the blast, which authorities said was probably a hydrogen explosion.
