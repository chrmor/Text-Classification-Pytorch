Six men arrested in connection to alleged international tennis match-fixing syndicate
Six men have been arrested in connection to an alleged international tennis match-fixing ring.
It is believed the syndicate was based in Victoria and bet on matches in Australia and overseas, with the outcome of the game pre-determined by at least one of the players involved.
The men were arrested in Melbourne and regional Victorian towns by detectives from the Purana Taskforce, which investigates organised crime syndicates.
Investigators from the Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit and Criminal Proceeds Squad were involved in the investigation.
A release from the Victorian police stated the six men will be "interviewed in relation to match fixing contrary to the Crimes Amendment (Integrity in Sports) Act".
"A 27-year-old from Brighton, 40-year-old from Daylesford, 28-year-old from Bonbeach, 29-year-old from Sandhurst, 27-year-old from Black Rock and a 26-year-old from Cheltenham are assisting police with their enquiries," the statement said.
The men are still being interviewed.
