Redemption tastes sweet for Bellamy's resilient men
It won't go down as the greatest grand final, and certainly won't be considered the greatest night for rugby league, given the fallout ahead of us. But Melbourne's second official premiership is something worthy of greatness.
Both teams have rebuilt remarkably but the Storm's effort to fight back from their catastrophe of 2010 is something to celebrate. And they no doubt will, knowing no one will take this one away from them.
The Storm did a remarkable job keeping Bulldogs fullback Ben Barba quiet, while their own No.1, Billy Slater, had a night to savour. He has been through all the ups and downs of Melbourne's remarkable recovery, and experienced similar emotions last night as he angrily accused Englishman James Graham of biting his ear before coming up with the plays that counted.
A first-half try, not long after the blood was wiped from his ear, and a second-half save were critical moments. The latter was the moment of the match - Barba looked like he was about to finally explode into the contest when he found space down the left sideline and kicked in-field for centre Josh Morris. But as the ball bounced high, Slater leapt to meet it, punching the ball dead.
