Nine people, including one Australian, have been killed when a skydiving plane crashed and burst into flames at a popular New Zealand tourist spot.
The Fletcher fixed-wing plane went down near the airstrip at Fox Glacier, a central attraction in the UNESCO-designated World Heritage area on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island.
"All nine people on board were killed," a police spokesman said.
As well as the Australian, police listed the victims as the pilot, four New Zealand males and tourists from Ireland, England and Germany.
New Zealand prime minister John Key says it has been a bad day for the country's South Island, which also saw a devastating earthquake hit the city of Christchurch this morning.
"I've only had a very limited message from the minister of civil aviation but obviously our hearts go out to the families," he said.
"The South Island's really bearing the worst of it at the moment and our our hearts go out to, as I say, those family and friends."
Initial details of the tragedy were sketchy because of the remoteness of the area, however, the police spokesman said he understood the plane burst into flames after it crashed.
The only skydiving company in the area, Skydive New Zealand, would not comment on the tragedy.
However, a message on the company's answering machine said:"Unfortunately, we will not be skydiving for the rest of the day".
The Civil Aviation Authority and Transport Accident Investigation Commission have been notified.
