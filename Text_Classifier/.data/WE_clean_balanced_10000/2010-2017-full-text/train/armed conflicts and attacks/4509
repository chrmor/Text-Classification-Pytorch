Bahrain protests grow ahead of anniversary
Almost a year since a crackdown began on demonstrations among Bahrain's Shia Muslim majority, thousands of protesters have taken part in marches to demand political reform.
The government says it is listening to the demands of protesters, but the opposition says that despite promises, little has changed.
Clashes between both sides have worsened in the build up to the February 14 anniversary of the start of the protests.
Small-scale demonstrations happen virtually every night in neighbourhoods close to the capital Manama.
