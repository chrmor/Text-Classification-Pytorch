Sweden celebrates 70th birthday of King Carl XVI Gustaf
Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf may be young compared to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth – he’s 70, she’s just turned 90 – but he celebrated his birthday in style on Saturday, surrounded by fellow royals from across Europe.
Among those gathering at the Royal Palace in Stockholm were Spain’s former King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, making a rare joint public appearance.
