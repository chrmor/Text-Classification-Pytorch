Severe turbulence on Aeroflot flight leaves 27 injured
3 hours ago I was on a Plane going From Moscow to Bangkok, out of nowhere we hit turbulence, that was so bad that it was throwing people around like crazy. Blood everywhere, people with broken bones, noses, open fractures, baby's with head injuries, I can keep going and going. Thank God we are Alive! I really hope @aeroflot @aeroflotrus will do right by everybody! I can honestly say I have never been so scared in my life before. #aeroflot #emergency. we are ok!
