Drone strike kills six suspected militants in central Yemen
CAIRO - A drone strike killed six suspected al Qaida militants in an overnight attack in eastern Yemen, tribal sources said on Thursday. The apparent US drone strike targeted a car travelling in al Rawda city in Shabwa province, a remote desert area where al Qaida militants are believed to be operating. The province has been targeted by drone strikes this year. Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has taken advantage of a conflict pitting Houthi militiamen against forces loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to grab territory and operate more openly. Dozens of al Qaida militants reclaimed the town of Azzan in Yemen's Shabwa province on Monday, residents said, exploiting a security vacuum. The United States has kept up a drone campaign against the militants, adding to near-daily air strikes by a Saudi-led Gulf Arab coalition, which intervened in the war last March to rout the Iran-backed Houthis and restore Hadi's government. Suspected US drone strikes, which normally use Hellfire missiles, have killed some of AQAP's top leaders, including its chief Nasser al-Wuhayshi last June.
