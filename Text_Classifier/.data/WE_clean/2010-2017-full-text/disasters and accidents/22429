Hurricanes Ignacio, Jimena Expected to Strengthen
As of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. advisory bulletin, Hurricane Ignacio was 840 miles east-southeast of Hilo, traveling at 10 miles per hour in a west-northwest direction that is expected to continue before taking a slight northwest turn.
Forecasts predict that the forward movement will decrease through Sunday.
Hurricane Ignacio is holding maximum sustained winds of 90 mph with the expectation that it will continue to strengthen through late Saturday before beginning to weaken. The intial strengthening will be helped by a friendly environment, according to CPHC, who says low shear is a contributing factor.
CPHC officials say that the center of Hurricane Ignacio should pass close by, but to the northeast of the Big Island as a hurricane early next week.
Recently-formed Hurricane Jimena continues to quickly intensify, according to the National Hurricane Center.
As of 5 a.m., the storm was about 1,073 miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja, Calif., traveling west at about 12 mph.
Hurricane Jimena was hosting maximum sustained winds of 90 mph as it rapidly intensifies.
Over the next 48 hours, NHC forecasters are predicting that Hurricane Jimena will strengthen. An environment of low shear and warm water are conditions expected throughout the forecast period that are conducive to strengthening.
Hurricane Jimena is still south of a strong ridge that extends southwest from the southwestern United States, which will keep it on a western course over the next day. After a 24-hour period, the ridge is forecast to weaken and Hurricane Jimena will then be allowed to turn west-northwest through day five.
