Giant Andy Scott statue felled in roundabout crash
A giant sculpture of a striding man by public artist Andy Scott has been knocked over in a car accident.
The 4m (13ft) structure, installed at Muirside roundabout, Tullibody, in Clackmannanshire, is one of five pieces in the county by the artist.
It is understood a car crashed into the statue, which sits outside the village police station, at about 2110 GMT on Saturday.
Central Scotland Police said they were investigating the incident.
The sculpture - also known as the Man in Motion - is made of welded steel mosaic and has the Wallace Monument and Stirling Castle as a backdrop.
Brian Smith, a college lecturer who lives near the sculpture, said the impact of the crash must have been considerable.
He said: "Whoever crashed into it has made a fair mess.
"It looks like they've driven into one of the statue's legs and brought down abut five or six tonnes of metal.
"I don't know if it quite stopped them but it certainly slowed them down."
Mr Smith said the erection of the piece in 2008 split the local community.
He added: "It's quite an arresting sight when you see it lying there. I have heard from a few people that they never liked it, although I doubt they would prefer it looking like this."
Glasgow artist Andy Scott is a sculptor, whose best-known works are in galvanised steel.
His other projects include the Kelpie heads at Falkirk's Helix project and the Arria statue at Cumbernauld.
