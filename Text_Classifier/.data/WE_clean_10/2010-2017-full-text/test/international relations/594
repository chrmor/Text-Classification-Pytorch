China warns against military acts as U.S. ship nears
BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday warned against any military acts in its exclusive economic zone, in response to Washington’s decision to send an aircraft carrier near a South Korean island recently shelled by North Korea.
“We oppose any unilateral military act conducted in China’s exclusive economic zone without approval,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in an online response to a question regarding China’s position on the U.S. carrier George Washington participating in joint naval exercises in the region.
The exclusive economic zone is a sea zone up to 200 nautical miles from a country’s coast.
