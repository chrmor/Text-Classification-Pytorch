Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price wins the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player, the Vezina Trophy as the league's most outstanding goaltender, and the Ted Lindsay Award as the league's most outstanding player as chosen by fellow players. Price becomes the first player to win both the Hart and Vezina Trophies in the same season since José Théodore, also of the Canadiens, in 2002. (AP via ESPN)
