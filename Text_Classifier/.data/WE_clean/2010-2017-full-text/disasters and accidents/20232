6 Taiwan firefighters killed in bowling alley roof collapse
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) â€” Six Taiwanese firefighters were killed early Tuesday when a burning roof collapsed on them in a bowling alley, media reports said.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency said firefighters had rescued two brothers from the bowling alley, which was closed at the time. Other firefighters were then trapped when metal supports gave way and the roof fell on them in Taoyuan city south of Taipei, it said.
The fire originated in an electrical transformer box on the bowling alley's second floor, it said.
Many young firefighters in Taiwan choose the work to fulfill their required year of national service as an alternative to the military.
