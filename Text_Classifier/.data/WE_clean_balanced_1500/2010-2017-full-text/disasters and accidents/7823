Egypt bus crash kills 8 Americans, injures 21
Eight American tourists have been killed and 21 others injured in Egypt after the bus carrying them collided with a truck, Egypt's national news agency reports.
MENA says the crash happened early Sunday in southern Egypt, as the bus from Aswan was ferrying passengers to Abu Simbel to see an ancient temple.
Poor roads and lax enforcement of traffic rules in Egypt have been blamed for many road accidents.
Estimates put the number of annual fatalities on the road at 8,000.
