An indictment against Palestinian engineer Dirar Abu-Sisi who has been held in Israel for the past two weeks, was filed with Beersheba's District Court Monday. According to foreign reports, Abu-Sisi was kidnapped by Israel in Ukraine.
At this time, the charges remain classified. Last week it was reported that police were planning on charging him with severe offenses. (Ilana Curiel)
