Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann abruptly resigned Monday, saying he had lost the backing of his Social Democrats party.
Faymann, 56, who heads the government but is appointed by the president, made the surprise announcement in a brief statement in Vienna. “I am thankful for seven and a half years and wish my successor much luck,” he said.
He has held the chancellor position since 2008 but been under pressure since his party's electoral collapse in the first round of presidential elections last month.
Voters in Austria, like elsewhere in Europe, have flocked to populist parties across the continent amid frustration over the region's refugee crisis.
Austria's anti-immigration Freedom Party picked up 36% of votes in the first round. The Social Democrats' candidate finished second to last. The runoff is on May 22.
The Freedom Party's strong showing under leader Norbert Hofer marked the first time since 1945 that neither the centrist Social Democrats nor the conservative Austrian People's Party won enough votes to make it to the second round of presidential elections.
Hofer will face off with Alexander Van der Bellen, the leader of Austria's Green party.
