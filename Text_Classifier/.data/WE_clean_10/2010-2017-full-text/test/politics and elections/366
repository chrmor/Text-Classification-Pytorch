US Senate to vote Tuesday on debt bill
The US Senate will vote Tuesday on a massive austerity bill that averts a disastrous debt default, two senior Democratic aides said Monday.
The chambers' top Democratic and Republican leaders were working on a deal to streamline often cumbersome senate procedures, with a final vote expected Tuesday, the aides said.
That could put a final vote within hours of a midnight Tuesday (1300 AEST Wednesday) deadline by which cash-strapped Washington will run out of money to pay its bills.
The US House of Representatives was to vote late Monday on the agreement, which raises the $14.3 trillion US debt ceiling in return for some $US2.1 trillion ($A1.92 trillion) in spending cuts over 10 years.
