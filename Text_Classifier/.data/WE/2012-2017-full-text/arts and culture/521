ESPN apologises for 'offensive' headline
US sports network ESPN has apologised for an "offensive" headline that appeared on one of its web pages.
ESPN was forced to apologise for an anti-Asian slur directed at Chinese-American basketball player Jeremy Lin that appeared in a story on its website for mobile users.
The headline "Chink in the Armor" was included in the online story about Mr Lin's role in the New York Knicks' 89-85 loss to the New Orleans Hornets.
It said in the statement it was "conducting a complete review of our cross-platform editorial procedures and are determining appropriate disciplinary action to ensure this does not happen again. We regret and apologise for this mistake".
ESPN said that the headline appeared to only mobile browsers for a 35-minute period.
