Hyundai, Kia recall nearly 60,000 cars in S. Korea
SEJONG, Feb. 16 (Yonhap) -- Local industry leader Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. are recalling over 57,000 vehicles, including the Grandeur Hybrid, the transportation ministry said Monday.
Hyundai Motor is recalling 10,604 units of the Grandeur Hybrid, produced between Dec. 24, 2013 and Oct. 24, 2014. The recall is for a faulty electronic program in the vehicle's brake system that may fail to warn the driver of a leak or lack of brake fluid, which could lead to a failure of the brake system, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
Kia Motors, the country's second-largest automaker, is recalling certain model years of the Bongo 3, the automaker's flagship commercial truck. The vehicles may have a faulty brake system that could cause the vehicle to tilt left, potentially leading to a loss of control or even an accident.
Subject to recall are 47,347 cars produced between Dec. 2, 2007 and Dec. 1, 2013.
Free repair services will be available from Tuesday at Hyundai and Kia service centers throughout the country.
