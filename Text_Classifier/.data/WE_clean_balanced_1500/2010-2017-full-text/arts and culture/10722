Australia bans award-winning Swedish film Children's Island over child porn concerns
Censors have refused classification for a 30-year-old award-winning Swedish film, in effect banning it, after an application by the Australian Federal Police.
The Classification Review Board’s decision to refuse classification for Children’s Island, handed down in October but not reported until now, has echoes of the 2008 controversy over Bill Henson’s photographs of naked children.
Titled Barnens ö in Swedish, the arthouse film focuses on an 11-year old boy grappling with the onset of puberty and contains scenes in which the boy is naked. It won Sweden’s most prestigious film prize, the Guldbagge, when it was released in 1980 and was Sweden’s official selection for the 54th Academy Awards. The film was directed by Kay Pollak, who later won acclaim for his box office hit As it is in Heaven.
Fairfax Media has not found any evidence of the film being refused classification in other countries.
