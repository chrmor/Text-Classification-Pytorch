Assange mum in London ahead of verdict
The mother of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has touched down in London ahead of his final legal bid against extradition to Sweden.
Assange is wanted in Sweden for questioning over allegations of rape and sexual assault, claims that Christine Assange says are unfounded.
Forty-year-old Julian has been under house arrest in London for more than a year without charge.
Ms Assange says she fears extradition to Stockholm could open the way for his extradition to the United States on possible espionage or conspiracy charges relating to WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of leaked US classified military and diplomatic reports.
She says waiting for the court's decision is dreadful.
"It's a 24-hour nightmare because we know he is not safe, and the biggest governments in the world are gunning for him," she told Network Seven.
