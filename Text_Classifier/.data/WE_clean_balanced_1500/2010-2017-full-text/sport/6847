Legend will have to bide his time before achieving Immortality
THE debate over whether Darren Lockyer should be rugby league's next Immortal is irrelevant, because he would have to be retired for five years before being considered anyway. But that wouldn't bother the champion five-eighth, because he would be much more concerned about winning tonight than worrying about his place in history.
And the Brisbane five-eighth and captain would never accept his teammates trying to ''win it for 'Locky''' on the occasion of his NRL record 350th first-grade game, against North Queensland at Dairy Farmers Stadium, because that would come at the risk of them losing focus on what they actually have to do to win.
After the Broncos arrived in Townsville last night, their coach, Anthony Griffin, told the Herald the week of preparation had gone exactly as he would have liked, adding: ''The players are all well aware it's Darren's 350th, and that it's a milestone to celebrate, but the main focus has been on the team. We've still got a football game to try to win, and they haven't lost focus on what they've got to do.
''[Johnathan] Thurston and [Matt] Scott are back for the Cowboys, and in a way that has had a good effect for us because it reminds you of how hard the Cowboys are going to be to beat up here. The Cowboys have a great side, and they're at full strength.''
The push for Lockyer to be declared the next Immortal gets bigger all the time, as he continues to record achievement after achievement in his final year before retirement. Former Canterbury great Terry Lamb, who, along with ex-Manly star Steve Menzies, shared the record of 349 games, said in a Brisbane newspaper report during the week that Lockyer had ''earned the right to be an Immortal, absolutely''.
