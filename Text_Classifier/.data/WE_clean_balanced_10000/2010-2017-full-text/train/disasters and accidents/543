Truck ploughs into Congo's Lake Tanganyika, kills 40
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Around 40 people were killed when an overloaded truck laden with passengers ploughed into Africa’s deepest lake, authorities said on Thursday.
The truck plunged into Lake Tanganyika in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, late on Wednesday, Wabunga Singa, territorial administrator for Uvira territory in South Kivu province, said.
“(We think) 40 are dead and four escaped but we don’t have a precise total,” Singa said.
“We don’t know how many people (are dead) because the bodies are all already in the lake, even the truck itself is in the lake.”
Singa said the cause of the accident was not yet known.
Road accidents are common in Congo, whose infrastructure has been battered by years of war. Last month, an oil tanker overturned in Uvira province, killing more than 270 after leaking fuel caught fire and exploded in the town of Sange.
