Caster Semenya wins 800m in Berlin as David Rudisha sets world record
Caster Semenya's return to the scene of her World Athletics Championships triumph was overshadowed today by a world record-breaking run from David Rudisha in the men's 800 metres.
Rudisha, of Kenya, clocked a time of 1min 41.09sec, taking 0.02 off the mark set by Denmark's Wilson Kipketer almost exactly 13 years ago. Rudisha's run came at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, where he was a semi-finalist in last year's world championships.
Semenya won the women's 800m in the same championships in a stunning time of 1:55.45, finishing well clear of the field. However, the South African then missed 11 months of competition while undergoing gender tests, the 19-year-old eventually being cleared to run again on 6 July this year.
She won her first two races back in low-key meetings in Finland, clocking 2:04.22 and 2:02.41, but improved significantly today to dip under two minutes with a time of 1:59.90.
