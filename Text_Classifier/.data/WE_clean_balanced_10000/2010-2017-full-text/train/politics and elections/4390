Romney camp claims GOP lead nearly insurmountable
The campaign of Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney tried Wednesday to put the best possible spin on Super Tuesday's mixed verdict, releasing a memo arguing that it is now nearly impossible for his opponents to catch him in the delegate hunt.
"Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of Gov. Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination," said Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director. "As Gov. Romney's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person's odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama's."
According to CNN's latest delegate count, Romney now has 404 delegates, compared with 165 for Rick Santorum, 106 for Newt Gingrich and 66 for Ron Paul. To claim the nomination, a candidate will need 1,144 delegates when Republicans meet for their national convention in Tampa this summer.
Among other things, Beeson said that there are now few major delegate prizes remaining and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegates -- a reality that makes it hard to narrow Romney's lead.
Santorum and Gingrich have argued otherwise, insisting there is still an anti-Romney majority within the Republican Party that can unify in the weeks ahead. Next on the calendar: Kansas holds its caucuses Saturday, followed by contests in Alabama, Mississippi, and Hawaii on Tuesday.
Romney -- generally perceived as more moderate than Santorum or Gingrich -- "still has a problem with the base," said Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor who was press secretary for President George W. Bush. "That base problem may make him attractive to independents if he gets to a general" election, but can work against the former governor in the primary season.
"It looks we're going to get at least a couple of gold medals, and a whole passel full of silver medals," Santorum told cheering supporters in Ohio before the outcome in the Buckeye State was known.
A Gingrich campaign source told CNN on condition of not being identified that the former House speaker will become the third GOP candidate to get Secret Service protection starting Wednesday. Romney and Santorum already have that protection.
"But those numbers are more than data on a spreadsheet; they are worried families and anxious faces," said Romney, who was interrupted repeatedly by chants and cheers. "And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them: You have not been forgotten. We will not leave you behind. Our campaign is on the move, and real change is finally on the way."
"Tonight we've taken one more step towards restoring the promise of America," he said. "Tomorrow we wake up and we start again. And the next day we'll do the same. And so it will go, day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart."
Santorum also focused on Obama, saying the president's policies threatened the individual liberty of Americans. But he targeted Romney as well for his health care law in Massachusetts, arguing it was the model for Obama's federal health care reforms detested by conservatives.
