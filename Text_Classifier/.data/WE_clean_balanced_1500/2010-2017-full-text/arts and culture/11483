Ex-porn star Amber Rayne is found dead at her home in Los Angeles
Former porn star Amber Rayne has died at her home in Los Angeles, officials have confirmed.
Friends and former colleagues have tweeted tributes to the 31-year-old, who apparently passed away in her sleep at the weekend.
Amber starred in porn films for more than a decade before retiring in 2015.
She was one of a group of women who claim James Deen, another porn star, assaulted them. He denies the allegations.
The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner has told Newsbeat that no formal cause of death has been confirmed.
However, they said her family had been informed.
Ms Rayne, whose real name was Meghan Wren, announced her retirement from the adult entertainment industry last year.
Fellow porn stars tweeted their shock after hearing about her death.
Amber's death comes a few months after she made headlines by accusing fellow porn actor, James Deen, of assaulting her.
Deen's ex-girlfriend and fellow porn star Stoya claimed he'd raped her, tweeting: "I said no, stop, used my safe word. I just can't nod and smile when people bring him up any more."
James Deen told his Twitter followers that he wanted to "assure my friends, fans and colleagues that these allegations are both false and defamatory".
He voluntarily resigned from the board of industry group, the adult performer advocacy committee (Apac), after which more women came forward with allegations against him.
They included accusations from fellow performer Tori Lux, and Amber Rayne, who claimed he'd punched her in the face and made her bleed so much she had to stop filming - something he denied.
