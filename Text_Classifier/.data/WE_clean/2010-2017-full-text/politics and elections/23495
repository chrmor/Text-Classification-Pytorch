Clashes in Turkey's main Kurdish city after vote
Turkish police fired tear gas and water cannon at Kurdish militants who were protesting after Sunday's election appeared to deliver a clear victory to the Justice and Development Party (AKP), an AFP photographer said.
The clashes erupted outside the headquarters of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey.
Latest results say the HDP won slightly over 10 percent of the vote, just enough to scrape into parliament.
The photographer said gunshots were heard but it was not immediately known if there were any casualties.
There are fears of a return to all-out war between the Turkish state and rebels from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after tit-for-tat violence shattered a fragile 2013 ceasefire.
