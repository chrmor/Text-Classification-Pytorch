6 Police Killed In IS Attack
Afghan officials say gunmen affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) extremist group have killed six police officers in the restive eastern Nangarhar Province, which borders Pakistan.
The insurgents reportedly attacked the administrative headquarters in Haska Mina district in the early hours of June 11.
Officials said 15 IS fighters were killed and seven wounded in the battle.
Nangarhar has long been plagued by insurgent groups.
In recent months, government troops backed by air strikes have claimed success against IS fighters, who are believed to be former Taliban members.
