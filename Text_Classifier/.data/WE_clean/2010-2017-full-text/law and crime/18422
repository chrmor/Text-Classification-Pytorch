Roger Rogerson arrested over alleged murder of Jamie Gao
Police have arrested disgraced ex-detective Roger Rogerson at his home in Sydney's south-west, over the alleged murder of Sydney student Jamie Gao.
Shortly before 11am, about 10 officers arrived at the premises and went inside.
A short time later, he was escorted from the Padstow Heights home in handcuffs.
Mr Rogerson's solicitor, Paul Kenny, said he was disgusted his client had been arrested in his home after arrangements had been made for the 73-year-old to hand himself in at midday
