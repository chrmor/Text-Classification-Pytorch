London - Counter-terrorism officers on Sunday arrested another man in connection with the hacking death of a British soldier on the streets of London, Scotland Yard said.
The 22-year-old was taken into custody in north London on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, one day after three other men - aged 21 to 28 -were detained on the same charge.
Meanwhile, the two men who were arrested on murder charges at the scene of the gruesome attack on Wednesday, in which 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby was repeatedly stabbed in broad daylight, remain in hospital in stable condition after being shot by police at the scene.
One of the hospitalised murder suspects, Michael Adebolajo, had been previously arrested in Kenya for reportedly trying to join Somali Islamist militant group al-Shabaab.
The British national had been arrested under a different name near Kenya's border with Somalia in 2010 and was deported back to Britain.
"Kenya's government arrested Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo. We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo," said government spokesperson Muthui Kariuki.
"The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to him after we handed him to British authorities," he said.
Members of the victim's family, including his mother and widow, laid flowers at the scene of the murder in south-east London on Sunday.
