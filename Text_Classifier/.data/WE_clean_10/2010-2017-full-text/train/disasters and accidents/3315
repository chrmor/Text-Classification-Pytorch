Miami streets under water after Tropical Depression Emily
The rain overpowered the city's new stormwater system. Miami Beach Assistant City Manager Eric Carpenter told CNN affiliate WPLG that Tuesday's rain had "significantly higher intensity" than what the system is designed to handle: nearly 8 inches of rainfall and a peak of intensity of around 3 inches per hour.
"So ... I'm trapped at work," Instagram user duchess_natasha wrote. "The Publix across the street has closed and sand bagged their doors to keep the water from rushing in. Cars are stalling out along the street. And then you have the guy who made a raft out of a floating barricade. Well, at least there's food and alcohol here at work."
