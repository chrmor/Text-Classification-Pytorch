Migrant crisis: Hungary closes main Budapest rail station
David Cameron has visited camps in Lebanon and Jordan to meet Syrian refugees who have fled their country's civil war.
The Prime Minister has called on other EU countries to "step up to the plate" and follow Britain's lead by funding refugee camps around Syria.
Mr Cameron said there was a "direct connection" between shortfalls in aid for camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey and the influx of migrants into Europe.
