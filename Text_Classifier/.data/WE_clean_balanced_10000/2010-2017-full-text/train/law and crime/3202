Vietnam relaxes foreign land ownership laws
Hanoi Vietnamese lawmakers have approved a law allowing broad foreign ownership of property, as the government seeks to boost an ailing real estate market and accelerate growth.
Foreigners with a valid visa, as well as foreign companies and international organisations operating in Vietnam, now will be permitted to purchase houses and apartments. Current laws restrict ownership to foreigners married to Vietnamese and those foreigners deemed to make significant contributions to the nation’s development.
The law is the latest government move to bolster the property market, following a housing stimulus program and a low-cost home loan package. Vietnam is stepping up efforts to boost economic growth to 5.8 per cent this year and clear up bad debts in the financial system, some tied to property.
“It is a very helpful move, a good change of policy, to open up the real estate sector not only for overseas Vietnamese, but also for foreigners," Ho Chi Minh City-based chief economist at VinaCapital Alan Pham said. “It pro­jects an image of opening the economy to foreign capital, and might help the bad debt problem."
