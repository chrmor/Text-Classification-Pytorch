New Brunswick promises financial aid to flood victims
HALIFAX - New Brunswick is promising financial help for people whose homes and businesses were flooded after days of rain caused rivers to overflow.
Premier David Alward had an aerial tour of some of the damage caused around St. Stephen, a town of about five-thousand that borders Maine.
Some roads were washed out and rushing water gouged a deep ravine between a house and a two-car garage.
Alward says he spoke with Keith Ashfield, the federal cabinet representative for New Brunswick, about the possibility of financial relief.
But he says it's too early to know any specifics since the situation is still developing.
The St. John River began spilling over its banks in some low-lying areas Tuesday after heavy rain and the flooding also reached into Nova Scotia.
In Cape Breton, a storm that dumped almost 140 millimetres of rain in places over a 36-hour period closed bridges and the Cabot Trail for a while and knocked out power and telephone service.
The village of Dingwall bore the brunt of flooding and by yesterday afternoon, access to the community was limited to a quarry road.
