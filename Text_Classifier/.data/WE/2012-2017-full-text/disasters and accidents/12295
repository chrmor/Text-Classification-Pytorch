Floods kill 42 people in Tanzania, authorities say
ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) â€” Floods from a heavy 30-minute storm in Tanzania killed at least 42 people in an area close to Lake Victoria in Kahama district, authorities said.
Rains from the storm left 900 people homeless and destroyed 160 houses in the deluge Tuesday night, Tanzania's Meteorological Agency said Thursday.
Government spokesman Assah Mwambene said that the government is providing support for the victims of the floods.
President Jakaya Kikwete has sent condolences to bereaved families and promised that the government will do its best to support the victims.
The Tanzania Meteorological Agency has said that rains this year are expected to be heavy and warned those living in low lying areas.
Tanzania generally experiences a long rainy season between March and May and another spell of rains between November and December.
