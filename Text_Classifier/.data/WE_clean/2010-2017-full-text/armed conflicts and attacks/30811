Navy SEALs Kill 7 Militants in Yemen Raid but Suffer Injuries
WASHINGTON — Members of the Navy’s elite SEAL Team 6 killed seven militants, but suffered combat wounds themselves, during an early Tuesday raid on a compound associated with Al Qaeda in Yemen, the Pentagon said.
Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to say how many members of the SEAL unit had been wounded or to describe the extent of their injuries, citing rules for secrecy and operational security. But he said the injured Americans were not in such serious condition that they required medical evacuation.
Reprieve, a London-based human rights organization, said five civilians had been killed in the raid, including a 70-year-old, partly blind man who was shot when he tried to greet the Navy SEALs, mistaking them for guests arriving in the village. But Captain Davis said, “We don’t have reason to believe that’s the case.”
It was the first ground raid in Yemen that the military has acknowledged since Navy SEALs carried out a similar attack in late January, the first such operation authorized by President Trump. One Navy SEAL team member died and three others were injured in that mission, and as many as 25 civilians were killed.
