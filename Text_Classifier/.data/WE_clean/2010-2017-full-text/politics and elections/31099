French socialist leader resigns, says the left must change radically
ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: President Emmanuel Macron won a commanding majority in France's parliamentary election on Sunday (June 18), pollsters' estimates showed, sweeping aside mainstream parties and securing a powerful mandate to push through his pro-business reforms. The result, if confirmed, redraws France's political landscape, humiliating the Socialist and conservative parties which alternated in power for decades until Macron's election in May. Two pollsters projected that Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) and its Modem allies would win 355-360 seats in the 577-seat lower house, lower than previously forecast. A third poll by Elabe initially showed a far bigger majority, projecting 395-425 seats for the Macron alliance, but later brought down its forecast to 373-403. The three projections predicted the conservative Republicans and their allies would form the largest opposition bloc with 107-133 seats, while the Socialist Party, in power for the last five years, and its partners would secure 30-49 seats, their lowest ever. He said the party would have to rebuild itself from the top down. Cambadelis was knocked out of the running for parliament in last week's first round of voting.
