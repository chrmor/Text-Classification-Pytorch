At least 36 dead in Togo after gusts tip boats
LOME, May 9 (Reuters) - At least 36 people died when gusts of wind caused several boats to capsize on a lake in southeastern Togo, a witness and a local chief said.
The passengers were returning from a funeral on the other side of Lake Togo when the accident took place late on Sunday.
Poor roads and railways force many in Africa to use the continentâ€™s lakes and rivers for transport, but accidents are common, frequently due to over-loading and poor maintenance.
