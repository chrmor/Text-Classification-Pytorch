Two teens, 13 and 15, carry out Pisgat Ze'ev terror attack, critically hurt 13-year-old
A 13-year-old Jewish boy from Pisgat Ze’ev is in critical condition Monday after being stabbed nearly a dozen times by two teenage Palestinian terrorists in Jerusalem’s Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood, marking the third terrorist attack in the capital in six hours. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the attack took place at approximately 3 p.m., when a 13-year-old Palestinian and a 15-year-old Palestinian armed with knives attacked the Jewish boy while he was riding his bicycle.
“Both terrorists stabbed the boy many times all over his body before a driver neutralized the 13-year-old terrorist by ramming his car into him,” said Rosenfeld. “The other assailant then stabbed a 25-year-old Jewish man nearby before being shot dead by police.”What are the Palestinians hoping to achieve? ‏Magen David Adom paramedics arrived at the scene moments later and rushed the boy and second victim, who was in serious condition, to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Rosenfeld said.The 13-year-old Arab assailant was also transferred to an area hospital in serious condition, he said.Less than an hour earlier, a Palestinian woman was shot after stabbing a Border Police officer near the capital’s police headquarters.Rosenfeld said that attack took place at approximately 2:15 p.m., near the Ammunition Hill light rail stop, when the unidentified suspect stabbed the officer on a sidewalk.“Officers on the scene shot the woman immediately and cordoned off the area,” Rosenfeld said minutes after the attack. “The officer was treated by Magen David Adom paramedics and rushed to an area hospital in light-to-moderate condition.”Rosenfeld said the suspect was seriously injured and has also been hospitalized, adding that police are investigating the attack and continue to maintain a high level of security throughout the capital.“Police continue to step up security and will continue to prevent or neutralize terrorists who carry out attacks,” he said.Earlier on Monday morning, a Palestinian terrorist was shot and killed near Lion’s Gate, in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City, after attempting to stab a Border Police officer. It was the third such attack at the contested site in less than 10 days.According to police, at approximately 9 a.m., the assailant, whom police deemed suspicious, was asked to stop for inspection. The suspect then withdrew a knife from his pocket and charged one of the officers, stabbing him in his metal breastplate. Police immediately opened fire, killing the man, later identified as 18-year-old Mustafa Hatib, the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber.Despite markedly heightened security, coupled by newly-installed metal detectors, the area located near the entrance to the Temple Mount remains one of the most volatile and dangerous  sections of the Old City.On the night of October 3, a Palestinian terrorist murdered two Jewish men and wounded a mother and son there on a stabbing and shooting spree, before he was shot dead by police. The victims were Rabbi Nehemia Lavie, 41, an Old City resident who worked at the Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva, and Aharon Benita from Beitar Illit. Five days later, an armed ultra-Orthodox man was stabbed in the back of the neck by an 18-year-old Palestinian woman before shooting her at close range.Amid the capital’s ongoing wave of violence, Acting police Police Chief Bentzi Sau on Sunday ordered 1,000 extra highly-trained Border Police officers to be dispatched to the Old City and flashpoint Arab neighborhoods to assist the 3,500 officers presently on the ground.Stabbing attacks against Jews have become so common that Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat last Thursday encouraged citizens with gun permits to remain armed when walking the city streets.Meanwhile, police said 17 Palestinians in east Jerusalem suspected of throwing rocks and firebombs at officers and Jews in the capital were arrested overnight, bringing the total number of Palestinian arrested since October 1 to nearly 350.
