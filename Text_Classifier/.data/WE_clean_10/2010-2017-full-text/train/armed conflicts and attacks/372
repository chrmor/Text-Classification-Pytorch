Another person has died of their injuries after Thursday's suicide bombing in the southern Russia city of Vladikavkaz, bringing the death toll to 17.
The attack devastated the main market in the capital of North Ossetia, part of Russia's troubled North Caucasus region.
"Fourteen people died at the scene of the blast, and another three died in a hospital. Among them are an 18-month old boy, a man and a woman," the republic's health minister, Vladimir Selivanov said.
Over 120 remain in hospital, he added.
Police have detained three men suspected of involvement in the bombing.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the attack had been carried out by people "without a soul, without a heart."
The blast is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks that have rocked the troubled North Caucasus region in recent weeks, including a suicide attack on a military base in Dagestan.
The Vladikavkaz market had been attacked in the past. In 1999, an explosion killed 55 people and injured 300 others. In 2008, 12 people were killed and over 40 injured in a bus bombing.
