Murray downs Djokovic to win US Open
Andy Murray has finally won his first grand slam title following a five-hour long five-set win over Novak Djokovic in the US Open final on Tuesday morning (AEST).
After grinding out a tough two-set lead, Murray was challenged by a strong Djokovic fightback to push the match to five-sets, before prevailing 7-6 (12-10), 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2.
The third seed and recently crowned London 2012 Olympic gold medallist opened a 3-0 lead in the final set to gain the upper hand in the latter stages of the match.
The first set took some 87 minutes of fighting tennis, ending in a tiebreak. The second was an easier time for Murray, taking it in just under an hour to appear to have one hand on the trophy.
But Djokovic, the 2012 Australian Open champion, roared back into the match, claiming the third and fourth sets to give fans packed into Arthur Ashe Stadium a reminder of Murrayâ€™s 0-4 record in grand slam finals.
The 25-year-old Murray held on in the fifth set, and is the British champion in a grand slam for the first time since Fred Perry, in 1936, who also won the US Open.
