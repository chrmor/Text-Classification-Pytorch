UPDATED: Cairo University clashes intensify leaving 16 dead, at least 200 injured
Clashes escalated near Cairo University in the capital's Giza district late Tuesday night, where supporters of President Mohamed Morsi continue to demonstrate.
According to the latest health ministry statements, 16 people were killed and at least 200 injured.  
Those injured included a police officer – Satea El-Nomany – who was shot in the eye, according to Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website.  
Security forces have reportedly intervened in an effort to end the clashes.
According to eyewitnesses cited by Reuters, gunshots were heard in the area and police were seen firing tear gas.
Pro-Morsi demonstrators began gathering outside Cairo University late Monday night in response to millions-strong opposition rallies demanding that Morsi step down.
Clashes erupted in the area hours before Morsi's Tuesday night televised address, in which he defied calls to step down, citing his democratic legitimacy.
