U.S. Apologizes to India for ‘Frisking’ Former President
The U.S. government has apologized to India and to former Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for not following “appropriate procedures” during the security screening of Mr. Kalam on Sept. 29 at John F. Kennedy airport in New York, the American embassy in New Delhi said in a statement Sunday.
The statement came after the news that the former president was “frisked” — with U.S. security officials even taking “his jacket and shoes to check for explosives” — hit the Indian news websites Sunday around noon. NDTV news channel reported that India’s Minister for External Affairs S.M. Krishna had asked the Indian ambassador to the U.S. to “take up the issue at the highest level.”
“This is unacceptable and is being taken very seriously,” it quoted Mr. Krishna as saying.  Another news reportsaid India was outraged enough that it had  “threatened retaliatory action against U.S. dignitaries.”
None of the news reports said why the incident was being reported more than a month after it occurred.
The news reports on Sunday also mentioned that Mr. Kalam was earlier subjected to “frisking” by a U.S. airline in April 2009.
A statement from India’s  Ministry of External Affairs Sunday evening said the U.S. authorities had explained to the ministry that Mr. Kalam “does not fall into the category of persons exempt from security screening.” The ministry said the two governments are “planning to hold discussions to explore appropriate mechanisms for facilitating airport procedures for dignitaries, in accordance with national regulations.”
The U.S. Embassy statement said that its Chargé d’Affaires, Ambassador Peter Burleigh, “personally hand-delivered a letter from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to former President Kalam, and a similar letter was delivered to the Government of India” subsequent to the incident. The statement didn’t say when the letters were delivered.
“In these letters, the United States Government extended its apology that appropriate procedures for expedited screening of dignitaries had not been followed. We are actively working to prevent similar incidents in the future from occurring,” the statement said.
