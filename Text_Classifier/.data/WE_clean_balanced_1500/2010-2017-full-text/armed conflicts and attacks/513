Anderson Cooper Attacked, Punched In The Head By Pro-Mubarak Mob In Egypt
Anderson Cooper and his crew were attacked by supporters of Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Wednesday. CNN's Steve Brusk tweeted that Cooper was punched in the head ten times.
The incident came as pro-Mubarak supporters attacked protesters calling for the Egyptian president to step down. Speaking on "American Morning" after the attack, Cooper said that he and his crew had been trying to go to a neutral zone between the two groups.
"We never got that far," he said. "We were set upon by pro-Mubarak supporters punching us in the head." Cooper said that he and the crew tried to escape, but that the crowd only grew: "the crowd kept growing, kept throwing punches, kicks...suddenly a young man would look at you and punch you in the face."
A CNN update said that "no one was seriously hurt" in the attack.
A pro-Mubarak group also roughed up a Washington Post editor on Wednesday.
Cooper spoke to The Huffington Post from Cairo on Monday. He later filed this report on the attack, with new footage of it happening:
