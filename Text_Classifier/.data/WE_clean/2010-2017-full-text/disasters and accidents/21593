Ukraine evacuates hundreds from site of deadly Kiev fuel blasts
Kiev: Hundreds of residents were evacuated from the site of a series of fuel depot blasts near the Ukrainian capital that set off a ferocious fire and left several people missing and at least one confirmed dead.
The defence ministry said it was also taking emergency measures to prevent the flames engulfing a nearby military airbase which has MiG-29 fighter jets and munitions on site.
Security Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov and Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak rushed to the scene to oversee the rescue operations.
"We are facing a serious threat... because 50 metres from the edge of the fire, we have a military installation stocked with an arsenal," Mr Turchynov said in televised comments.
