Bashir hearing lasts less than 30 minutes
Radical Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir has spent less than 30 minutes in court on the first day of his trial on terrorism charges, refusing to take part because he was not given the required notice to appear.
Thursday's proceedings began under strong security with hundreds of heavily-armed police officers deployed to the South Jakarta District Court as the 72-year-old arrived for the first day of a case expected to take months.
Hundreds of his supporters shouted "God is great, God is great" as Bashir entered the courtroom in his customary white robe, waving as he took his seat before a panel of five judges.
The co-founder of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and the man many suspect was behind the deadly 2002 Bali bombings, is facing seven fresh charges including one count of planning and/or inciting a terrorist act, which carries a maximum penalty of death.
He is also charged with trafficking in weapons and explosives for the purpose of conducting terrorism, which also carries the death penalty, as well as supplying funds for terrorism, which carries a jail term of between three and 15 years.
However, the judges adjourned the trial until next Monday after the defence complained that Bashir was only subpoenaed to appear in court on Tuesday. Under Indonesian law, defendants must be given at least three days' notice.
