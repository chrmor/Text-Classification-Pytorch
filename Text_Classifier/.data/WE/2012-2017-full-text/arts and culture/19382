Cultural Conservative Icon Phyllis Schlafly Dies at 92
Cultural conservative activist and icon Phyllis Schlafly died Monday at her home in St. Louis, according to a spokesman for the Eagle Forum political group she founded.
Schlafly rose to prominence and influence among conservative Republicans beginning in the early 1960s through her focus on promoting conservative family values, namely her opposition to feminism and abortion rights.
Schlafly first gained widespread notoriety through her book, "A Choice, Not an Echo," a call to arms for conservatives and an argument for the 1964 Republican candidacy of Barry Goldwater.
As momentum for the Equal Rights Amendment grew in the 1970s, Schlafly became its most outspoken critic — and was vilified by its supporters.
She had a pie smashed into her face and pig's blood thrown on her, and feminist Betty Friedan once told Schlafly: "I'd like to burn you at the stake." She was chastised in a 1970s "Doonesbury" comic strip — a framed copy of which hung on her office wall.
"What I am defending is the real rights of women," Schlafly said at the time. "A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother."
Thirty-five states ratified the amendment, three short of the necessary 38. Schlafly said amendment supporters couldn't prove it was needed.
