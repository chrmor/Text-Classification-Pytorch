Blast In Mosque Kills Four In Eastern Afghanistan
A blast in a village mosque has killed at least four people and wounded nearly 40 others in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry said on June 10.
The explosion occurred when local men in the village of Hisara in Nangarhar’s Rudat district had gathered for Friday prayers, the ministry said in a statement.
The mosque's imam was among the dead, it added.
The ministry said the "terrorist attack" was carried out by "the enemies of the Afghan people."
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assault.
