Bus plunges off cliff in Peru killing 20
AT least 20 people were killed and 34 injured when a speeding inter-provincial bus ran off a cliff in the high Andes of Peru.
Most of those who survived the pre-dawn crash have serious injuries, said a police spokesman in the city of Ayacucho, located 320km southeast of the capital Lima.
More than 50 passengers were aboard the bus, which was heading from Lima to Ayacucho.
"Some of the bodies were mutilated by the powerful impact," police said, adding that rescuers were trying to retrieve bodies trapped amid the mangled steel.
Peru's roads are among the most dangerous in Latin America: 3400 people a year were killed on average over the past six years in traffic accidents in Peru.
Last year there was a slight improvement - 2852 people were killed in Peruvian traffic accidents.
The high death toll is blamed on perilous mountain roads, bad road conditions, poor vehicle maintenance and untrained drivers.
