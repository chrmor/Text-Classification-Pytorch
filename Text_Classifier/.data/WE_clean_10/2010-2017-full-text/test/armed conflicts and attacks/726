BBC protests at police assault on its Cairo correspondent
The BBC is to make an official protest to the Egyptian authorities after one of its journalists was assaulted by police in Cairo today.
Assad Sawey, the BBC's Cairo correspondent, was deliberately assaulted by police while reporting on a baton charge during the street protests.
When surrounded by men who appeared to be plain clothes security men, he identified himself as a BBC journalist. He was repeatedly hit, taking blows to the head.
He reported that they beat him with steel bars, "the ones used here for slaughtering animals." His camera was confiscated and he was arrested.
After being released without charge, he received medical attention for a head wound, and then continued reporting.
The BBC's global news director Peter Horrocks said: "The BBC condemns this assault on one of our correspondents by the authorities. We shall be forcefully protesting this brutal action directly to the Egyptian authorities.
"It is vital that all journalists, whether from the BBC or elsewhere, are allowed to do their job of bringing accurate, impartial eye witness reports to audiences around the world without fear."
