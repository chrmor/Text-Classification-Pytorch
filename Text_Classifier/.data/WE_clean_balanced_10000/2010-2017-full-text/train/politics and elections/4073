Opponents threaten boycott, Chad leader delays poll
N’DJAMENA (Reuters) - Chadian President Idriss Deby has agreed to postpone the presidential election due on April 3 after opposition candidates threatened a boycott over flaws in the process, one of them said on Saturday.
Only four days ago Deby rejected the appeal for a postponement by his five opponents, who had demanded new voter registration lists and voter cards.
“We met the head of state and we agreed it was impossible to start campaigning tomorrow, March 13,” Nadji Madou told Reuters after talks with Deby and the other candidates.
There was no immediate comment from Deby. Opposition candidates boycotted the 2006 election over similar concerns.
Deby’s ruling party and allies won a February 13 parliamentary election. Past attempts to hold the election had failed because of lack of security in the oil-producing former French colony, which has seen a lull in rebel attacks after years of unrest.
