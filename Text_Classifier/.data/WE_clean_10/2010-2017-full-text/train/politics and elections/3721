Thousands demonstrate for and against carbon tax
A petition containing 25,000 signatures has been presented to Senator Eric Abetz during a large anti-climate tax rally in Sydney's Hyde Park.
Thousands of people turned up for the event this morning, many waving derogatory banners and placards aimed at Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Greens leader Bob Brown.
A short distance away in Belmore Park, thousands more people gathered to call for action on climate change: including putting a price on pollution and investing in renewable energy.
The Hyde Park demonstration mirrored in size and tone a rally held in Canberra recently.
