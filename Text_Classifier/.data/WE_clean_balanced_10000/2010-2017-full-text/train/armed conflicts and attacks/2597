Greek ex-PM Lucas Papademos injured in Athens car blast
Former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has been injured by an explosion inside his car in Athens.
Reports say the blast may have been caused by a letter bomb.
Mr Papademos, 69, had leg, arm and stomach injuries, but officials said his condition was "not a cause for concern". His driver was also injured - but not seriously. Reports say at least one other person in the car was hurt.
No group has so far claimed responsibility for Thursday's blast.
Mr Papademos was appointed caretaker prime minister in November 2011 amid political and economic turmoil. He served in post until May 2012.
He has also served as vice-president of the European Central Bank.
The explosion occurred at about 18:30 local time (15:30 GMT) in central Athens.
Mr Papademos and his driver, who has not been named, were then taken to Evangelismos Hospital.
Reports say the third person in the car was a banking official.
Current Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who is attending a Nato summit in Brussels, is being kept informed of the incident, Greek news agency ANA said.
In March, a letter bomb sent from Greece exploded at the International Monetary Fund office in Paris.
The employee who opened the letter suffered hand and face injuries and staff were evacuated.
Days earlier, a parcel bomb meant for German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was intercepted and destroyed in Berlin before it could explode.
Greek far-left group Conspiracy of Fire Cells said it was responsible for sending that device
