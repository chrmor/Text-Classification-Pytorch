GM to Recall 4.3 Million Vehicles for Software Defect
General Motors said Friday it will recall nearly 4.3 million vehicles worldwide for a software defect that can, in rare instances, prevent airbags from deploying during a crash, an issue that has been linked to one death and three injuries.
The Detroit automaker said the recall of newer trucks, cars and SUVs from the 2014-2017 model years would not have a material impact on its financial results.
GM (gm) said the sensing and diagnostic module that controls airbag deployment has a software defect that may prevent the deployment of frontal airbags in certain “rare circumstances when a crash is preceded by a specific event impacting vehicle dynamics.”
Separately, GM along with other automakers, have had to recall vehicles because of defects in Takata-made airbags. In July, the company said it could lose $550 million if U.S. safety regulators require it to recall another 4.3 million of its vehicles to replace Takata airbag inflators
Takata, one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto safety equipment, has had problems with its airbags since 2008. Those problems have escalated in the past three years as fatalities linked to the inflators have risen, triggering recalls and lawsuits.
