Isabella Rossellini to head 2011 Berlin film jury
BERLIN (Reuters Life!) - Italian-American actress and director Isabella Rossellini will head the jury at the 2011 Berlin film festival, organizers said on Monday.
The annual event, one of the world’s top film festivals, runs from February 10-20 next year.
“She (Rossellini) is a multifaceted, creative film artist with extensive experience in European, American and international cinema,” said festival director Dieter Kosslick.
The daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian director Roberto Rossellini, Isabella started her career as a fashion designer and journalist working mainly in New York.
Her acting debut came in 1976, when she appeared alongside her mother in “A Matter Of Time.”
Rossellini rose to prominence internationally with her performances in David Lynch’s films “Blue Velvet” (1986) and “Wild at Heart” (1990).
The actress can next be seen in Saverio Constanzo’s “The Solitude of Prime Numbers,” a film adaptation of Paolo Giordano’s novel of the same name, screening in the upcoming Venice film festival.
Berlin did not announce any other members of the jury which will decide the main prizes, including the Golden Bear for best film. This year’s festival jury was headed by Werner Herzog.
