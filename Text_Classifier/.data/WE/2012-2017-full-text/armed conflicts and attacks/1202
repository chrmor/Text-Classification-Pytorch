Pakistan school grenade attack kills 6 year old boy
A suspected militant tossed a hand grenade into a school in northwest Pakistan, killing one child and wounding two others Monday, police said.
The attack took place at a co-educational school on the outskirts of Peshawar, said police official Tahir Ayub.
A 6-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries from the blast while two second graders were in serious condition, Ayub said.
"The child that was lost today wasn't one family's child but the entire nation's child," Sardar Babuk, the provincial education minister told reporters. "We will continue our fight against evildoers."
No group immediately claimed responsibility but "this seems to be the work of militants," Ayub said.
