Australia reclaims Cormac McAnallen trophy
Australia has reclaimed the Cormac McAnallen trophy, surviving a final-quarter Irish challenge to win the second Test by three points (55 to 52) at Croke Park and clinch the international rules series by a combined 10-point margin.
Ireland dominated the final term and raced to a four-point lead midway through, before three-point goals to Dane Swan and Brad Green pushed the Australians back in front with three minutes left to play.
Bryce Gibbs, Todd Banfield, Dane Swan, Liam Picken and Dustin Fletcher were key players for Australia, which took a seven point aggregate lead into the game, with Daniel Cross also busy through the middle and James Frawley reading the play well from defence.
Green scored a game-high 16 points for Australia (including four three-point 'overs'), with Swan scoring three 'overs' and both Banfield and Adam Goodes two overs. Irish forward James Kavanagh scored the game's only six-point 'under' goal during the third term.
A 28-17 point first half gave the Australians room to move, the game bizarrely held up at the start of the second term after Ireland was found to have 16 men on the pitch, Marty Clarke heading to the bench after both teams were called to the middle for a head count.
Trailling 38-48 at three-quarter-time, Ireland scored six quick points at the start of the final term to edge within four points, and while some strong Australian defensive pressure denied them another three scoring chances, Daniel Goulding's strong mark and long three-pointer, then Michael Murphy's even longer three-point shot saw them hit the lead 52-48.
