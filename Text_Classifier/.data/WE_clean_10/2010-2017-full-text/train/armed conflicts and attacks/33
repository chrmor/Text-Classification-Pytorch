ISIS claims responsibility for hacking death of doctor
ISIS claimed responsibility for the hacking death of a Bangladeshi doctor killed by machete-wielding attackers.
Homeopathy doctor Sanwar Rahman, 55, was in Kushtia district on his way to a medical center where he volunteered his services to the poor, according to police.
The attackers struck Friday when he was walking with a teacher from the Islamic University of Kushtia.
"They were on a motorbike and the attackers hacked them on the neck and head," said Proloy Chism, a district police superintendent .
Rahman died on the spot and the teacher was taken to a nearby hospital with serious injuries.

Earlier this month, a 65-year-old Sufi Muslim spiritual leader was hacked to death. ISIS said its militants "assassinated a doctor who was calling for Christianity in Kushita," according to the ISIS-linked Aamaq Agency. Rahman and the injured teacher were followers of Lalon Shah, an 18th-century Bengali lyricist and secular thinker, police said. No arrests had been made in the attack.
