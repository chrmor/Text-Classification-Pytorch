Yemen Backtracks on Suspending U.S. Raids After Civilian Casualties
In Cairo, however, Yemen’s foreign minister, Abdul Malik al-Mekhlafi, called for the review of the operation, in which one American commando and some 14 fighters of Al Qaeda died, adding that “Yemen continues to cooperate with the United States and continues to abide by all the agreements.”
Yemen’s embassy in Washington said in a statement that it had not suspended any counterterrorism programs with the United States. But hinting that Yemeni leaders were not fully informed in advance about the mission, the embassy also said that “any counterterrorism operations carried out in Yemen should continue to be in consultation with Yemeni authorities and have precautionary measures to prevent civilian casualties.”
The raid, which suffered a number of failings and faced unexpected resistance, was an early test of Mr. Trump’s national security decision-making — and his willingness to rely on the assurances of his military advisers. His aides say that even though the decision was made over a dinner, it had been fully vetted and had the required legal approvals.
