PC Alex MacFarlane: No verdict in race abuse retrial
A jury has failed to reach a verdict in the retrial of a policeman accused of racially abusing a suspect days after the riots in London last year.
PC Alex MacFarlane, 53, denied causing racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress to Mauro Demetrio on 11 August 2011.
Southwark Crown Court heard Mr Demetrio believed he was stopped on suspicion of drug-driving because he was black.
Prosecutors said they would not be seeking a third trial.
Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson told the judge it was "not in the public interest" for another trial to take place.
"May I therefore offer no evidence against Mr MacFarlane," he said.
Richard Atchley, defending, said the officer would now face disciplinary proceedings.
The five women and seven men, who had been told they could return a majority decision, could not agree on a verdict.
The retrial was ordered after a jury failed to reach a verdict in the case last week.
In April, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered Mr MacFarlane be charged after it reviewed an earlier decision not to prosecute.
