Reims - At least two people died and nine were injured when an apartment building in the French city of Reims collapsed on Sunday after a suspected gas explosion, authorities said, leaving people trapped under debris.
"Two people died and nine were hurt," in a provisional toll after the accident, a spokesperson for the city's firefighting department told AFP.
Local authorities said the "probable" cause of the collapse of the four-storey building in the heart of the Champagne region was a gas explosion.
An AFP photographer present at the scene - citing rescue workers - said victims were still buried under the rubble of the building.
