Peru revokes parole for US terrorist
A US woman convicted of being part of a Peruvian guerrilla group was ordered back to prison in Peru on Wednesday after a public outcry over her being paroled five years early from a 20-year sentence.
Lori Berenson, 40, turned herself in to police to comply with the ruling, her lawyer and husband, Anibal Apari, told reporters in front of the US embassy in Lima.
Berenson was freed on parole in May after serving 15 years of a 20-year term for taking part in a foiled plot by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to seize control of Peru's congress.
On Wednesday, a Lima court ruled in favour of an appeal lodged by prosecutors, revoking Berenson's parole which had been given on the basis of good behaviour and her having expressed remorse for her actions.
"The criminal division which heard the case annulled the court decision that had allowed Berenson's release, and therefore ordered her immediate detention in a penitentiary," Deputy Justice Minister Luis Marill said.
Berenson, a New York native who in May 2009 gave birth to a baby boy while in prison in Peru, voiced regret at her past actions during an appellate hearing this week.
