Venezuelan military depot blast kills one
Residents evacuated from Maracay, 60 miles south of Caracas, after a fire set off a series of explosions
A fire set off a series of explosions at a military arms depot in Maracay, Venezuela today, killing one person and leading authorities to evacuate about 10,000 people from the surrounding area.
Residents were evacuated from within a four-mile perimeter around the depot, Rafael Isea, governor of Aragua state, told state television. "This is a preventive measure because the ammunitions that were detonating have a powerful impact," he said.
The cause of the fire was unclear. State radio reported that firefighters were beginning to extinguish the blaze after a series of smaller explosions.
