Eight soldiers killed in PKK bomb attack in Turkey
The state-run Anadolu Agency said the bomb exploded on a highway in the mainly-Kurdish province of Siirt as their military vehicle was passing by.
The attack comes amid renewed violence between the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and Turkey's security forces.
Dozens of people, most of them police and soldiers, have died in the violence since July.
