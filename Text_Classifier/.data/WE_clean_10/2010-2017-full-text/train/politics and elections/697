Britain cuts top income tax rate in annual budget
British finance minister George Osborne on Wednesday used his annual budget to cut the top rate of income tax while pledging an "unwavering commitment" to slashing debt.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne said Britain remained on course to virtually wipe out its budget deficit by 2017 as the government seeks to preserve its top credit rating.
Osborne outlined plans to slash the top rate of income tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, arguing he would collect five times more cash per year from the wealthy via new property taxes and a clampdown on tax avoidance.
The British economy would meanwhile grow slightly better than expected this year, by 0.8 per cent rather than the previous forecast of 0.7 per cent.
He also predicted that Britain would avoid recession this year despite an economic downturn for the neighbouring eurozone, adding that the government would borrow slightly less than expected in the fiscal year to April 2012.
"This budget reaffirms our unwavering commitment to deal with Britain's record debts," Osborne told lawmakers.
