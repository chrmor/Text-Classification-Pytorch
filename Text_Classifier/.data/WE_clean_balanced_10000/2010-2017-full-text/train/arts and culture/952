In line with the rest of the world, Yemen has, starting Thursday (yesterday), changed its weekend to Friday-Saturday, thus joining last the long list of Middle Eastern countries which decided to adapt their working week to their foreign partners. August 15th, 2013 marked the full implementation of Yemen's Council of Ministers resolution NO: 179 -2013. Ministry of Civil Service and Insurance confirmed that it had dispatched several inspectors throughout the country to ensure that the state's decision will be duly implemented and respected throughout. Speaking to al-Shorfa earlier this week on the matter, Saeed Nasher, Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Service and Insurance explained, "The decision to designate Saturday as a weekend day in place of Thursday came so Yemen could be more in sync with most countries of the world whose weekend days are Saturday and Sunday. Saturday and Sunday were workdays in Yemen, whereas Thursday and Friday were weekend days for us and workdays for most other countries." "Those were four lost days during which we were disengaged from the world. So the Council of Ministers decided to change the weekend, making Yemen the last Arab country to announce this decision," he added. While little will really change for the public, Yemen's financial and business sectors will however greatly benefit from this alignment with global markets, leveling out with its competitors. The government hopes that through such integration Yemen will be able to attract and retain foreign investors' interests, which ultimately will guarantee sustainable growth and help curb high unemployment levels.
