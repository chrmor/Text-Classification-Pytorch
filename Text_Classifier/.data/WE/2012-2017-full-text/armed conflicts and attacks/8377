Mali unrest: Kidal attack kills two UN peacekeepers
Two United Nations peacekeepers have been killed in a car bomb blast in the north-east Malian town of Kidal.
The blast hit a bank guarded by the peacekeepers and set fire to a UN armoured vehicle, eyewitnesses said.
Three other people have been wounded. More casualties are feared as the bank building collapsed. The dead are believed to be Senegalese.
There was no immediate claim for the attack which happened early on Saturday morning.
French troops defeated Islamist rebels in northern Mali almost a year ago, but insurgent attacks have continued.
Kidal is a stronghold of separatist Tuareg rebels, who said they were ending a ceasefire two weeks ago.
