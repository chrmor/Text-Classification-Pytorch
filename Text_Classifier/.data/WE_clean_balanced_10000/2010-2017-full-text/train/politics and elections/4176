Scott Walker, Wisconsin Governor, Says He Is Running for President
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made his long-expected White House run official Monday morning, tweeting that he will seek the GOP nomination for president.
In a video message uploaded to YouTube, Walker said: "America needs new, fresh leadership with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington to actually get things done."
Walker is slated to make an announcement speech Monday evening in Waukesha, Wisconsin.
The Wisconsin governor is considered a top-tier candidate seeking the GOP nomination,although he enters a crowded Republican field with 14 contenders already in the race.
Walker hopes to highlight his record as a conservative governor in a blue-leaning state, where he won three elections in the course of four years, including a victory in a bitter fight with labor unions during his 2012 recall election.
Walker's evangelical roots -- his father was a Baptist minister -- may also give him a boost in the early nominating state of Iowa, where he lived for seven years as a child.
