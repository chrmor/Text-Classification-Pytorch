Diamonds worth millions stolen from Basel jewel fair
Swiss Prosecutors office spokesman Markus Melzl says some of the thieves distracted an employee at a diamond trader's stall while others swiped the jewels from glass cabinet.
He said organisers of the annual Baselworld trade fair blocked the exits for half an hour shortly after Wednesday's heist but failed to stop the thieves escaping.
Mr Melzl added that the theft involved "probably four to five accomplices".
"Three diverted the attention of the diamond trader's employees, while two others opened the showcase," he said.
The thieves are believed to have checked out the display showcase several days before the theft, allowing them to make a quick move.
Mr Melzl noted that the Israeli trader, who was not identified, only realised the theft about 15 minutes after it was carried out, allowing sufficient time for the perpetrators to get away.
An investigation is now under way, with police examining video footage of the stand.
Some 1,892 exhibitors from 45 countries, including luxury brands such as Chopard, Patek Philippe, and Rolex as well as jewellery makers like Bulgari and Tiffany, are attending the Baselworld fair.
In 2009, 10 million euros worth of jewellery was stolen but the thief was quickly caught.
