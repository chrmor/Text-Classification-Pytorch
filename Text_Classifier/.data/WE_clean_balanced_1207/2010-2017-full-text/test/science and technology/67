Australia solar eclipse delights thousands
Tens of thousands of tourists and astronomers gathered in northern Australia to glimpse a rare total solar eclipse.
The eclipse, which occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, plunged parts of Queensland into darkness for just over two minutes.
Estimates suggest the event, early on Wednesday, was viewed live by millions.
