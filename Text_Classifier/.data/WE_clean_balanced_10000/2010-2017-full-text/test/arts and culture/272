In Pictures: Good Friday
Christians around the world have been marking Good Friday, reflecting on the day on which Jesus is believed to have been crucified in Jerusalem.
This year Orthodox Christians are celebrating Easter at the same time as Protestants and Roman Catholics.
For many Easter is a time of pilgrimage. Those who follow the stations of the cross in Jerusalem's Old City arrive at the site of his crucifixion at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in a state of rapture and devotion.
For some, such as this Catholic woman in Sri Lanka, Good Friday is a time of solemn reflection.
For others Good Friday has become a day on which they seek to mimic the suffering of Jesus himself. This man in Gauhati, India, is staging a mock crucifixion.
Much of Europe has been blessed with warm and fine weather. In the UK, this reverend re-enacts Jesus' march with the cross in the leafy surrounds of Croxteth Country Park, Liverpool.
Some parts of the UK, though, endured more typical British holiday weather. On the Northumberland coast, those trekking to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne had to brave fog and wet conditions to cross the mudflats to the island.
