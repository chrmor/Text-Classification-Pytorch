Carbon plan better than Rudd's
Regional independent MPs believe the Gillard government's carbon pricing package is substantially better than the Rudd government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott were both part of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee (MPCCC) that worked on the Clean Energy Future plan that was finally unveiled on Sunday.
The package imposes an initial $23-a-tonne price on carbon from July 2012 and offers compensation to nine out of 10 households.
Mr Windsor said the MPCCC process had not been easy but he was pleased with and proud of the final product.
"As I have said all along, I want to be part of something that does something about climate change, not part of something that collects revenue and shuffles it around," he said.
"I believe that this climate change package is an affordable catalyst for this change as it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean up our environment and move our economy from its dependence on fossil fuels ensuring the future of our children and their children."
