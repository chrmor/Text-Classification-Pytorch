China confirms it is building its first aircraft carrier
China has officially confirmed that it is building its first ever aircraft carrier, the centrepiece for an expanding naval force. But the People's Liberation Army insists it will pose no threat to other nations.
The 900 foot ship is being constructed in the north-east port of Dalian, and is expected to be ready for sea-trials later in 2011.
