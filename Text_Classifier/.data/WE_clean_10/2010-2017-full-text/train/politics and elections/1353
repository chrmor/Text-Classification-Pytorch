After TV cameras saw a rodent scuttling past the prime minister at least twice last month, No 10 has confirmed that it is to take on a feline deterrent.

The press were later invited to a south London property where Humphrey was photographed as evidence, although he did expire in 2006 from a kidney complaint.
His predecessor, Wilberforce, served no fewer than four prime ministers, and is said to have dined on Russian sardines bought for him by Margaret Thatcher.
