Kenyan student dies, more than 100 injured in campus stampede
One Kenyan student died and more than 100 others were injured after an exploding electricity transformer caused a stampede on Sunday, in a sign of high tensions a week after gunmen stormed another university campus, officials said. The student who died was among others who jumped from as high as five floors up, fearing the University of Nairobi's s Kikuyu campus had come under attack, university vice chancellor Peter Mbithi told Reuters. Gunmen from the al Qaeda-aligned group al Shabaab stormed Garissa University College, about 200 kilometers from the Somali border, killing 148 people on April 2.
