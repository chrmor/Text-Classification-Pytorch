Swiss arrest 15 suspected members of Italian crime syndicate
GENEVA (AP) â€” Swiss authorities have arrested 15 people sought by neighboring Italy as suspected members of the 'ndrangheta organized crime syndicate.
The Federal Office of Justice said the Italian citizens were arrested Tuesday in three Swiss regions, most of them in the northeastern canton (state) of Thurgau. They are suspected of belonging to a cell in Frauenfeld, in Thurgau, of the Calabria-based 'ndrangheta.
The suspects are being held pending possible extradition to Italy. Swiss authorities say their arrests were based on Italian extradition requests filed between February last year and January on charges of membership in a criminal organization. A court in Reggio Calabria already has imposed prison sentences on two of them.
