Hong Kong protest leaders among 116 arrested in crackdown
Two leading student activists are among scores of people arrested in Hong Kong in a crackdown on the two-month long pro-democracy street protests.
Authorities began demolishing one of the largest camps, in the Mong Kok commercial district, on Tuesday.
The operation began peacefully but scuffles broke out overnight and in the morning, during which Joshua Wong and Lester Shum were held for contempt.
Police say streets around Nathan Road are clear for the first time in weeks.
Some activists have said they will regroup elsewhere, vowing to continue their demands for a free choice of leader for Hong Kong's chief executive elections in 2017.
Other protest camps remain in the government district and the Causeway Bay shopping area.
There have been attempts to clear Hong Kong's streets before, notably of course, right at the beginning of the protests. Video footage of the protesters defending themselves with umbrellas from the pepper spray became the defining image and only served to give the movement massive momentum.
Now though, the authorities are taking a more careful approach. Recent clearance efforts, including those over the past two days in the Mong Kok district, have been to enforce the court injunctions, won by businesses including the city's taxi drivers, angered over the effect on their businesses.
They also come at a time when the protesters are weary after two solid months of sit-ins, their numbers dwindling, and not long after the world spotlight has left China following the Apec Summit. Scenes of Hong Kong chaos might not have played well with the world leaders meeting in Beijing.
But with Mong Kok cleared, two other sites remain, including the main protest site in the heart of the financial district. Further court injunctions or not, that remains a much tougher proposition.
The authorities have moved in on Mong Kok after local businesses secured court injunctions against the disruption to their businesses.
Early on Tuesday, court bailiffs backed by police removed a section of the camp at the junction between Nathan Road and Argyle Street.
Many protesters packed up and moved elsewhere but scores resisted, leading to arrests for contempt of court and obstructing police officers.
Then late at night on Tuesday and in the early hours of Wednesday, bailiffs and police - some carrying pepper spray and batons - also began clearing camps on Nathan Road, a major thoroughfare in Kowloon.
The court injunction was read out before bailiffs and workers - some wearing T-shirts that read "I love HK" - began dismantling barricades made of wooden pallets and other materials.
Police officers wearing helmets tore down tents and canopies. Other officers were standing by with backpack pepper sprayers, local media reported.
The Hong Kong Federation of Students said its leading activist Lester Shum was detained, along with Joshua Wong of the Scholarism movement and a number of other key protest figures.
It is Mr Wong's second arrest in recent months, after he was detained in September at the start of the protests.
Other arrests were for alleged offences including assaulting police, possessing offensive weapons and obstructing officers.
Mr Wong, from the Scholarism group, had earlier said the court orders were being used as an excuse to remove activists, according to the South China Morning Post.
