Bali landslide leaves 12  people dead, homes wiped out
Twelve people have been killed in three landslides across the tourist island of Bali, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency has said.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said landslides caused by sustained torrential rains hit three villages in Bali's Kintamani district, on the slopes of the Mount Batur volcano.
Members of two families were among those killed in Songan village, including a one-year-old boy, his seven-year-old sister and their mother.
Four people were killed in Awan village and one person died in Sukawana village.
"All victims have been evacuated and the injured have been taken to hospital," said Indra Kalak, an agency official in Bali.
The agency said more heavy rains are likely and people should be aware of the possibility of landslides and floods.
