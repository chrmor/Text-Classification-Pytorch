Manchester attack: UK threat level reduced from critical to severe – as it happened
Skiren Khan, 25, lives a few doors down from the property on Boscombe Street in Rusholme which was raided by police this morning.
She said she saw two men being put into a police van at about 9am. “It was quite calm. I saw it from my window,” she said.
Sunil Magnani, who runs a corner shop near Boscombe street, said two men were arrested at the terraced house this morning.
“One of my customers told me two guys were taken away, one Arab and one black guy,” said the shopkeeper.
There is still no confirmation by police of any arrests. A cordon is in place at both ends of Boscombe Street.
