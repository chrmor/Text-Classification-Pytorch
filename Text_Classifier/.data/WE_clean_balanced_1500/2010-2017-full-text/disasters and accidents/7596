Floods Kill More Than 50 People, Wreak Havoc in Argentina
BUENOS AIRESâ€”A rain storm that struck Argentina's capital and surrounding cities has claimed more than 50 lives and forced the country's largest oil refinery to stop production following a flood-related fire.
Flooding early Tuesday morning killed at least 46 people in the city of La Plata and caused six deaths in nearby Buenos Aires. Many neighborhoods in both cities were still flooded and without electricity Wednesday.
