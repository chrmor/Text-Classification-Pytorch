Thailand's deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra will face impeachment in the upper house over a costly rice subsidy scheme, the nation's anti-graft body said Thursday, in a ruling which could see her banned from politics for five years.
"The commission considers there is enough evidence to indict (Yingluck) and refers (the case) to the Senate," Panthep Klanarongran, chief of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) told reporters.
