Kalamazoo shooting suspect Jason Brian Dalton charged
(CNN)Authorities charged accused Kalamazoo, Michigan, shooter Jason Brian Dalton on Monday with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight firearms violations.
He showed no emotion in court as the charges against him were read. A judge denied Dalton bail.
For nearly five hours Saturday, police say, the shooter drove from one target to another, gunning down victims at random.
And in between the shootings, he apparently picked up passengers for Uber.
As families mourn the deaths of six people in Kalamazoo County, one question looms above all else: Why did the gunman do this?
"There isn't a connection that we've been able to establish between any of the three victim groups with each other, any of the three victim groups with the defendant," Getting told CNN's "New Day" on Monday. "It just is, well, it was random, unprovoked violence."
"There is this sense of loss, anger (and) fear," he said. "On top of that, how do you tell the families of these victims that they were not targeted for any other reason than they were a target?"
"I kind of jokingly said to the driver, 'You're not the shooter, are you?' He gave me some sort of a 'no' response ... shook his head," the station quoted the man, whom it identified only as Derek, as saying.
"My best sense is that it was somebody who was having an issue at the time and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did," Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller told CNN's "New Day" on Monday.
While Dalton was known to like guns, "there wasn't anything that would put him on the police's radar as someone who would be likely to do to something like this," he said.
Some of those answers could be coming, however. At a probable cause hearing just before an arraignment, detectives testified that Dalton said he told them that he "took people's lives," after he was read his rights that include the right to remain silent.
