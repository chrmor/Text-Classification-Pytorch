Flooding in the southern Pakistani province of Sindh has left more than 60,000 people homeless.
"At least 700,000 people have been affected by the floods caused by the recent rains in the six districts of Sindh province," Sajjad Haider Shah, an official in the provincial disaster management authority, said.
"Some 60,000 people have been rendered homeless, who have migrated to safer areas," Mr Shah said, adding that 30 people had been killed in the past week.
Rescue teams from the Pakistani navy and army are evacuating families to dry ground.
Local aid workers say food, drinking water and shelter are desperately needed.
Tens of thousands of people who were displaced by last year's devastating floods in the area are still living in tents.
British charity Oxfam released a report last month warning that the government has failed to take precautions against further natural disasters.
