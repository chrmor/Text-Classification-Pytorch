Shootings, Stabbings Leave 1 Dead, 4 Wounded In Annual Brooklyn J'Ouvert Festival
ABC 7 describes the “J’Ouvert march through Flatbush [as] an annual tradition that kicks off at 4 a.m. on Labor Day. It starts at Grand Army Plaza and runs down Flatbush Avenue to Empire Boulevard, Nostrand Avenue and Linden Boulevard.” There appear to have been shootings throughout the route on September 7.
The violence started “about 2 a.m.” NYPD say “a 24-year-old man was stabbed in the torso area and a 21-year-old man was shot in the buttocks” near Grand Army Plaza and Eastern Parkway. The stabbing victim died from his wounds while the gunshot victim was hospitalized in stable condition.
About 3:45 a.m. 43-year-old Carey Gabay “was shot in the head.” Gabay is Governor Andrew Cuomo’s (D) first deputy counsel. He is hospitalized in critical condition. NYPD reports that Gabay appears to have been “an unintended target.” They say “he was caught in the crossfire of two suspected gang groups.”
Another shooting occurred at Bedford Avenue and Sullivan Place  where “a 21-year-old was grazed by a bullet on his hand.” NYPD have a 21-year-old in custody for that shooting. A third shooting took place at Nostrand Avenue and Martense Street, where the NYPD say “a 39-year-old was shot twice in the torso area.” The 39-year-old victim is in stable condition.
In January 2013 Governor Cuomo pushed through a massive gun control package–the SAFE Act–that was supposed to reduce gun violence in the city and throughout the state. The safe act requires firearm registration, bans “assault rifles,” bans “high capacity” ammunition magazines, and expands background checks.
Yet Breitbart News previously reported that gun crime is up in New York City this year and the shootings at the 2015 J’Ouvert Festival are simply the latest proof.
