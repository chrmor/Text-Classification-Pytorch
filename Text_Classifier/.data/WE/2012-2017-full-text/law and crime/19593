Five Cuban volleyball players convicted of Tampere rape, one acquitted
Five Cuban volleyball players are facing jail sentences for their parts in a gang rape that took place at a Tampere hotel in early July. Pirkanmaa District Court announced the verdicts in the case on Tuesday, saying that five were guilty of aggravated rape while one was cleared of involvement.
The players were in Tampere for several World League matches before the Rio Olympics. Four of them now face five-year jail terms for aggravated rape, while the fifth has been sentenced to three years and six months behind bars.
Finnish police originally arrested eight players, but released two of them soon afterwards. A sixth was released in August. Cuba decided to compete in the Rio Olympics without the players, and having sacked two of the squad's coaches, but lost all five games in the Olympic tournament.
