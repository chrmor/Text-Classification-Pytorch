Iran asks Austria to secure nuclear talks against spying
Iran has asked Austria's government to take immediate measures to protect the cyber security of nuclear talks, media reported Saturday after reports emerged of suspected espionage at negotiation venues. Swiss and Austrian authorities said on Thursday they had opened separate investigations into alleged spying in hotels where the nuclear talks with Iran are taking place. Iran denies western allegations that it is covertly pursuing a nuclear weapon and insists its atomic activities are for peaceful energy purposes.
