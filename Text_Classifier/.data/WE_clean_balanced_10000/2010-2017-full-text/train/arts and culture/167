Oldest man in history dies at age 116
Tokyo: Japan's Jiroemon Kimura, recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest man in recorded history, has died at the age of 116.
Kimura died of natural causes in the hospital in his hometown of Kyotango, western Japan, at 2.08am on Thursday, the local government said.
A date for his funeral is yet to be set.
Born on April 19, 1897, when Queen Victoria still reigned over the British Empire, Kimura dodged childhood killers such as tuberculosis and pneumonia that kept life expectancy in Japan to 44 years around the time of his birth. He became the oldest man in recorded history on December 28, 2012, at the age of 115 years and 253 days. The oldest woman in recorded history, France's Jeanne Calment, died in 1997 at the age of 122.
"He has an amazingly strong will to live," Kimura's nephew Tamotsu Miyake, 80, said in an interview in December. "He is strongly confident that he lives right and well."
