Spanish photojournalist calls parents from Libya jail
A Spanish photojournalist detained by forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has telephoned his parents from a military prison in Tripoli.
Manu Brabo's father, Manuel Varela, told TVE his son had said he was being fed and was "in fairly good shape".
Mr Brabo was one of four journalists who went missing on 5 April while reporting from the outskirts of Brega.
The others were James Foley and Clare Morgana Gillis, both Americans, and Anton Hammerl, a South African.
On Thursday, Ms Gillis called her parents in Connecticut.
She told them she was being held with Mr Brabo and Mr Foley, but said Mr Hammerl had not been with them when they were detained.
Mr Varela told Cadena Ser radio that his son was detained for entering Libya illegally and taking photographs without permission.
Mr Brabo did not know when he might be released.
"I asked him if he had been ill-treated or had any problem and he said no, that he was in a military prison where there were other journalists and they were talking to each other and giving encouragement to each other," Mr Varela said. "He was also being well-fed."
Two photojournalists, Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, were killed in an attack on Wednesday in the besieged city of Misrata.
