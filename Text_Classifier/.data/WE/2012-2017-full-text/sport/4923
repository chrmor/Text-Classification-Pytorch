LAS VEGAS â€” In his toughest title defense yet, UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo thwarted Frankie Edgar's late rally and emerged victorious with a hard-fought unanimous decision.
The grueling pay-per-view bout bout headlined Saturday's UFC 156 event at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.
Aldo (22-1 MMA, 4-0 UFC), whose current 15-fight win streak includes six consecutive UFC and WEC title defenses, got matched up with Edgar (14-4-1 MMA, 9-4-1), a former lightweight titleholder looking for a fresh start at 145 pounds following back-to-back losses to Benson Henderson.
The five-round bout proved closer than the scorecards (49-46, 49-46 and 48-47) indicated. Additionally, though Edgar absorbed some heavy leg kicks and had his face bloodied with Aldo's accurate striking, the New Jersey native gained momentum and staged a late rally that won over most of the Vegas crowd.
As Aldo's speed advantage dissipated, Edgar took a slight striking edge in the later rounds. Edgar scored a slam-takedown in the fourth round and did damage while the fighters fought from the clinch. However, his rally ultimately came up short.
Edgar, who got the immediate title shot when he dropped weight classes, now has lost three straight fights, all via close decision.
"Another close one," he said. "I keep finding myself in these situations. It is what it is, though. Congrats to Jose on a great fight."
Despite the success of his early low kicks, which actually sent Edgar to the canvas on a few occasions, Aldo ditched the strikes in later rounds. It was a game plan that opened the door for Edgar's rally. However, the champ said there was a reason for it.
"I knew he was going to take me down if I kept throwing kicks," he said. "So I had to go to my punches."
Although UFC officials could make a case for an immediate rematch, other contenders such as Ricardo Lamas and Dong Hyun Kim patiently await a shot at Aldo's belt.
