Chinese human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong freed
Beijing - A leading Chinese human rights lawyer seized by police as part of a crackdown on dissent has been released and allowed to return home.
Jiang Tianyong, a critic of the Chinese government, returned to his Beijing home on Tuesday after two months in custody, his wife told the BBC.
It is not clear if Mr Jiang will face charges or is under house arrest.
The US has raised his case, and urged China to end the "extralegal" abduction and detention of lawyers and activists.
Mr Jiang disappeared on 19 February as he was visiting his brother in a Beijing suburb.
"My husband is back - I'm very glad. But it's not convenient to talk," Mr Jiang's wife, Jin Bianling, told the BBC by telephone.
