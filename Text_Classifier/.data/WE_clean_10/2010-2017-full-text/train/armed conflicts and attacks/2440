Police have been forced to intervene during a clash between the gay and lesbian community and a group of street preachers in Adelaide.
The violence broke out during a rally to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on Saturday.
The protest began peacefully with 150 members of the gay and lesbian community gathering to stage a mass wedding, calling for equal rights for gay marriage.
But when members of the Christian Street Church crashed the rally, tension escalated.
Protester Mel Lecke was pulled from her wheelchair.
"I think it's disgusting, you know we don't go and protest outside churches saying there is no God," she said.
Lesbian and church minister, Reverend Sue Wickham, says it was an awful end to a peaceful demonstration.
"I feel sad that it happens. I feel sad that there is still a vocal minority who always seem to be in the media who don't necessarily represent the view of the whole church," she said.
"Anyone who carries a banner that begins with the two words 'God Hates' is to my mind is not representing the Christ that Christians believe in."
The Christian Street Church's Damien Gloury says he was mobbed and hit.
"We're just preaching the Bible, we're quoting the bible and it says that homosexuality is a sin," he said.
"We thought we would go out and not try to disrupt because we do love everybody, it might sound like we're condemning people but we're not we're just preaching the Bible.
"We've been mobbed, we've been hit, our banners have been thrown down and these people have been hating our guts just for proclaiming the Christian message in this nation and that's what it's about," he said.
Protester James Vigos says the gay and lesbian community will not be disheartened by the violence.
"A very vocal minority can't stop progress," he said.
Police were called in and several street preachers were forcibly removed, but no one was arrested.
