Haiti flooding kills at least 23 people
At least 23 people have been killed in flooding in Haiti.
Most of the deaths occurred in the capital Port-au-Prince after torrential rain swept away houses, and flooded roads.
Two children were buried alive when their home collapsed; two other people died in a tent city erected after last year's devastating earthquake.
Haitian officials fear other such camps could be swept away during the hurricane season.
Days of heavy rain swelled rivers and flooded camps built to house thousands of evacuees after the 2010 earthquake.
Thirteen people were killed when landslides swept through the upscale suburb of Petionville.
The United States National Hurricane Center warned the rains could also cause flash floods and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Cuba.
Some camps reported flooding of up to 1.2m (4ft).
Meteorologists forecast more heavy rain for Tuesday night, increasing fears that already sodden hillsides could collapse.
