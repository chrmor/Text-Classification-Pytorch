Beijing Lifts Death Toll From Floods
BEIJINGâ€”Embattled Beijing city officials raised the death toll from weekend flooding to 77 from 37 as they fended off criticism, including from some Chinese state media, of their handling of the disaster.
City workers are still carrying out search efforts, which have been impeded by mudslides that followed Saturday's storm, the Beijing municipal government said in a statement posted to its official account on the Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo late Thursday night.
