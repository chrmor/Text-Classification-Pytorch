Water-bombers used to douse forest fire on edge of Bordeaux
Water-bombers were called in Saturday to try to contain a forest fire burning on the western outskirts of Bordeaux that has prompted dozens of evacuations including from a psychiatric facility, authorities said. The fire, which broke out Friday afternoon and spread quickly thanks to 50 kilometers-per-hour (30 mph) winds, has now consumed nearly 370 hectares (900 acres) of pine forest and is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city. Two water-bombers are working to contain the forest fire, with another two due to join during the day Saturday.
