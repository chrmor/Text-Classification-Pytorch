Pakistan Completely Lifts Moratorium On Death Penalty
Pakistan has decided to lift a moratorium on death penalty in all cases, months after restarting the capital punishment for terrorism offenses only.
News agencies, quoting government officials, said Tuesday that the interior ministry has directed provincial governments to proceed with execution by hanging for all condemned prisoners who have exhausted the appeals process and whose pleas for clemency are rejected.
Ending a seven-year-long suspension, Pakistan partially resumed executions in December after the massacre at an army-run school in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar by Taliban.
24 terrorism convicts were reportedly hanged since then, while thousands more are on death row in the South Asian Islamic nation.
