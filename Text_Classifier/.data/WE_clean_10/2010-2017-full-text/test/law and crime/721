First pirate trial in Germany in 400 years opens in Hamburg
The first pirate trial to take place in Germany in 400 years has opened in Hamburg.
More than seven months after the attack on the Hamburg-registered container ship MS Taipan, 10 Somali men are standing trial. They are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of the Somali coast in April.
One of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack, which would mean he could not be tried under German law. Experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older; however, with little reliable documentation on the youngster, this could be difficult to prove.
"A child should not be obliged to stand in court, if his given age of 13 is correct," the chair of the judging panel, Bernd Steinmetz said.
The eldest accused said he was 48, while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28; but none of them could give his precise date of birth. The accused have been communicating via interpreters, as they don't speak German.
Possible sentences between 10 and 15 years
