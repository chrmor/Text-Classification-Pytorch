Two men and a woman are dead in a siege which has ended with a man's arrest in Adelaide's eastern suburbs.
Two police were taken to hospital from the scene of the siege at Hectorville, one of them shot in the face.
The second officer was treated for a knee injury and released from hospital.
Police were fired on when they arrived at the scene and returned the gunman's fire.
They had been called in the early hours when a neighbour reported hearing shots.
They say a man ran from the house after the shooting, about 2:30am ACST, and into a neighbouring house in Montacute Road.
They negotiated with him and finally made an arrest after more than eight hours.
The man has been taken away by police for questioning.
A nearby resident spoke of what she heard in the early hours.
"We just heard some severe gunshots and obviously a lot of commotion, police cars and all the rest of it and then helicopters," she said.
Police are expected to hold a news conference later to give more details of the operation.
