Roma part company with Zdenek Zeman
Roma have announced the sacking of their manager Zdenek Zeman following the side's 4-2 loss against Cagliari on Friday night.
Zeman has recently been under intense pressure following a poor spell of form which sees the side eighth in the Serie A table.
This week, the Czech received a vote of confidence from the club but, after a home defeat to Cagliari, he has been relieved of his duties.
A statement on the club's official website on Saturday read: "AS Roma SpA wishes to announce that Mr Zdenek Zeman has been relieved of his duties as first-team coach.
"The club thanks Mr Zeman and his collaborators for the professionalism and dedication shown in carrying out the job. Mr Aurelio Andreazzoli has been temporarily placed in charge of the team."
Zeman was appointed Roma coach on a two-year deal in June, marking his second stint at the club following a period in charge between 1997 and 1999.
