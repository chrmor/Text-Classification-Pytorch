Striking bus workers to march in Joburg
Johannesburg - Thousands of striking bus drivers are expected to march through the streets of Johannesburg on Tuesday morning to demand a wage increase.
"Our members will come in droves to make employers aware that we mean business. We are not backing down from the double digit wage increase," said SA Transport and Allied Workers' Union (Satawu) spokesperson Vincent Masoga.
Bus drivers are on strike countrywide. The strike, which has entered its third week, has affected commuters.
Unions are demanding a 13% wage increase - down from 18% - and allowances for housing, nightshift, and long-distance journeys.
Talks between the unions and employers at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) are expected to resume this week.
Masoga said the bus drivers would march to the transport and road freight bargaining council in Braamfontein to hand over a memorandum of their demands.
They would then proceed to the city centre and hand over another memorandum at the offices of the private security sector provident fund.
"The fund has been exploiting workers for years.... Workers contribute to the fund, but get almost nothing from the fund which is supposed to look after their interests," said Masoga.
Johannesburg metro police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the marchers would gather at Pieter Roos Park in Parktown at 10:00, and would disperse at Park Station at 14:00.
The SA Police Service and members of the metro police would direct and monitor the march, said Minnaar.
