ICC upholds Pakistan suspensions
The International Cricket Council has upheld the provisional suspensions of Pakistan duo Salman Butt and Mohammad Amir after turning down their appeals.
The duo, along with Mohammad Asif who withdrew his appeal, were suspended while the ICC investigated spot-fixing claims from their tour of England.
ICC code of conduct head Michael Beloff said: "I've dismissed the application.
"All three players accordingly are still, for the time being, unable to participate in cricketing activities."
Butt, who was Test captain during the summer tour of England and bowlers Amir and Asif were questioned by British police following allegations published in the News of the World newspaper at the end of August about the final Test against England at Lord's.
It was claimed Asif and Amir deliberately bowled no-balls at pre-arranged times during the Test, with Butt also said to be involved, in return for money from a bookmaker's "middle man".
Fellow seamer Wahab Riaz was also questioned by police, whose investigation - separate from the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit's (ACSU) own investigation - remains ongoing, although no criminal charges have yet been brought.
