PBPA candidate Richard Boyd Barrett of the United Left Alliance, and son of actress Sinéad Cusack, defeats former minister and deputy Fianna Fáil leader Mary Hanafin in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. This leaves Fianna Fáil with one representative in the capital city (Brian Lenihan Jnr) and no Fianna Fáil women at all in the 31st Dáil. (The Irish Times) (Evening Echo)
