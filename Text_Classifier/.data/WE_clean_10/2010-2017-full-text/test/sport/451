Ivan Lendl to make Champions Tour debut
Lendl came from two sets down to beat McEnroe in the 1984 French Open Ivan Lendl will end 16 years away from tennis in October when he makes his ATP Champions Tour debut in Paris. The former world number one won eight Grand Slam titles, including three French Opens before retiring in 1994. Since then, the 50-year-old Czech-born player has barely picked up a racquet, choosing to spend time with his family. American John McEnroe, the man Lendl beat to win his first Grand Slam in Paris in 1984, will also play in the six-man Jean Luc Lagardere Trophy. Lendl, who also won three US Open and two Australian Open titles, came from two sets down to beat McEnroe 3-6 2-6 6-4 7-5 7-5 at Roland Garros 26 years ago. And McEnroe, who is keen to avenge what was a painful defeat, said: "Oh boy, l'm looking forward to it. What do you make of Lendl's return? "We had some great matches together but it's been a long time and he hasn't played for more than 15 years so I think we need to discuss a few things, both on and off the court. "I know he's been working most of the last year to get back into the type of shape he needs to be in, because it doesn't get any easier as you get older. But we'll be giving it our all, that's for sure." France's Yannick Noah, who has pursued a career as a recording artist during his time away from tennis, makes his return to the Champions Tour after an absence of more than seven years. A third French Open winner, Sweden's seven-time Grand Slam winner Mats Wilander, is also due to play in the event which takes place from 1-3 October at the Paris Racing Club in the Bois de Boulogne. Two as yet unnamed players will make up the six-man field which is split into two groups for a series of best-of-three sets round robin matches. The winner of each group will then meet in the final. The ATP Champions Tour brings together many of the greatest tennis players in history for competitive tournaments in cities across the world.
