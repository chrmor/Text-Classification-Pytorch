Dodgers' Josh Beckett throws no-hitter against Phillies
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett threw the first no-hitter of his career and of the 2014 season Sunday against the Philadelphia Phillies for a 6-0 victory.
The 34-year-old struck out six and walked three on 128 pitches. He set down 23 in a row before walking Jimmy Rollins with two outs in the ninth, and Chase Utley struck out looking to close the effort.
Beckett avoided the superstitions of an ongoing no-hitter, joking with teammates and Dodgers manager Don Mattingly from the fourth inning on.
Those conversations intensified as his pitch count inched past 115.
"He kind of asked me how I was doing," Beckett said in a postgame TV interview. "I said, 'You come on out there and we'll see how that ends.' "
Beckett had season-ending surgery last July to treat thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a rare condition that involves pain in the neck and shoulders, plus numbness of the fingers and a weak grip. The surgery removed Beckett's first rib on the right-hand side to relieve pressure on his nerves.
"Surgery has been a blessing for me," Beckett said. "You go through so many stepping stones. You gotta overcome everything. Every new thing is a new step. I overcame a lot."
This has been the highlight of his return, his first career no-hitter and the 21st in Dodgers history.
"It's great, you know, to follow guys like Sandy (Koufax) and even before that," Beckett said. "My whole career has kind of flown by. I don't know what I'm going to do following this year. I'm going to have to play that by ear and talk with my family."
Justin Turner homered and Adrian Gonzalez drove in two runs in support of Beckett.
"You think about it pretty much from the fourth on. I'm not one of those guys that carries on about no-hitters," Beckett said. "I think a lot of it was just my mixing the pitches. It's not like I'm out there throwing 95 mph, overpowering guys."
