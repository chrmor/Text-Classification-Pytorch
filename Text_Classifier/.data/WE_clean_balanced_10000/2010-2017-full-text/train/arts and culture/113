Paris Hilton to show her real life in new TV show
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Paris Hilton is headed back to television — this time in what is billed as a behind the scenes look at the life and friends of the jet-setting socialite and model.
The Oxygen television network, which is aimed at young women, has given the go-ahead to a reality series that brings “an all-encompassing look at her life, friends, family, and relationships, all that’s not represented every day,” original programing chief Amy Introcaso-Davis said in a statement on Thursday.
The show will also feature Hilton’s friends Brooke Mueller — the estranged wife of “Two and a Half Men” star Charlie Sheen — and former Playboy model turned photographer Jennifer Rovero, along with her mother Kathy Hilton.
The show has no name or air date as yet.
Hilton, 29, the great-granddaughter of Hilton hotels founder Conrad Hilton, appeared with friend Nicole Richie in “The Simple Life” years ago and searched for a best friend in the MTV series “My New BFF” in 2008.
A business woman with lines of fashion, hair, fragrance and shoes that she either helps design or endorses, Hilton is rarely out of the news.
Last week, she pleaded guilty in Las Vegas to cocaine possession, and the next day was refused entry to Japan to take part in a fashion show.
In 2007, she famously spent three weeks in jail in Los Angeles for violating her probation on a reckless driving charge.
Oxygen said the new TV show would follow Hilton “as she enters the next stage of her life.”
