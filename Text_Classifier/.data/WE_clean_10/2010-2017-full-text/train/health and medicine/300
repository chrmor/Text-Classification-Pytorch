In Guinea, a Hard-Won ‘Victory’ Over Ebola
The World Health Organization announced Tuesday morning that Guinea was free of Ebola virus transmission for the first time since the epidemic was detected there in March 2014.
All three of the West African countries hardest hit by the epidemic — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — have now documented stopping the original chain of infections that experts believe began in December 2013 with the undiagnosed illness of a young boy, Emile, in the village of Meliandou in Guinea’s forest region.
“This is a very big victory for the nation and the people of Guinea,” said Fode Tass Sylla, a spokesman for the country’s Ebola task force. He thanked other countries, the health organization and private charities for their support.
Two 21-day incubation cycles of the virus have passed since the last person in Guinea with the illness, a 3-week-old girl, twice tested negative for the virus. The country now enters a three-month period of heightened surveillance during which the virus could re-emerge, as it has done twice in neighboring Liberia after that country ended transmission. (In mid-January, human-to-human transmission linked to those cases could be declared ended.)
