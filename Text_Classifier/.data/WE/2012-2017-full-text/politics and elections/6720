Sudan's President orders closure of pipelines carrying oil from South Sudan
Sudan's official news agency says the country's president has ordered the closure of pipelines exporting South Sudanese oil.
The Sudan news agency SUNA quoted President Omar al-Bashir as telling a public rally in the capital Khartoum on Saturday that the move was in response to South Sudan's funding of rebels fighting his regime.
The Sudan news agency quoted al-Bashir as saying the "decision follows careful study of all its consequences and repercussions."
South Sudan, which became independent of Khartoum in 2011, has denied supporting rebels.
The two sides had just agreed in March to resume crude exports after a shutdown caused by disputes over oil transit fees. South Sudan must export its oil to international markets through pipelines owned by Sudan that run through its territory.
