Ukraine crisis: John Kerry and Sergey Lavrov meet for talks on Crimea vote
US secretary of state meets Russian foreign minister at ambassador's residence in London as he tries to halt Crimea referendum
Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, are meeting in London on Friday for talks on Ukraine before Sunday's planned referendum in Crimea.
The meeting is taking place at the US ambassador's residence in central London as Kerry attempts to head off a vote that could lead to Crimea – now under the control of Russian troops – deciding to become part of Russia.
Both the US and the EU say that if the referendum – which they have declared illegal – goes ahead, Moscow will face the prospect of fresh sanctions being imposed.
Western diplomats expressed little optimism ahead of the London talks. Nothing resembling a peace plan has been sketched out between the two sides, one said. Kerry and Lavrov have spoken almost daily as the Ukraine crisis has unfolded but have yet to find any common ground.
Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, on Thursday accused Russia of demonstrating unacceptable "military aggression" that has "no reason and no grounds". Moscow has deployed 10,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, deepening the crisis. The Russian defence ministry claimed the troops were only involved in a training exercise that would last two weeks.
Yatsenyuk told the UN security council he was convinced Russians did not want war. He urged Russia's leaders to heed the people's wishes and return to dialogue with Ukraine. "If we start real talks with Russia, I believe we can be real partners," he said.
Rhetoric from western capitals has stepped up in recent days as the planned referendum nears. Kerry warned on Thursday that Russia could face "a series of serious steps" if Russia annexes Crimea. Before leaving Washington for London, he said the EU was planning to join the US in imposing more sanctions on Moscow if the referendum went ahead. The sanctions would include a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, backing up Kerry in the strongest language she has employed so far, on Thursday told the Bundestag that the consequences for Russia would be huge if it failed to enter into negotiations. She ruled out military force, but warned sternly that the crisis would cause "massive damage to Russia, economically and politically".
David Cameron underlined the threat of sanctions when he sat down with Kerry ahead of the talks with Lavrov, telling him that "we want to see progress as much as you do."
"We want to see Ukrainians and the Russians talking to each other. And if they don't then there are going to have to be consequences," he said.
The US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Kerry would reaffirm US support for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity without interference or provocation by Russia. Kerry had previously declined a Russian invitation to Moscow and his decision to go to London prompted speculation the Kremlin may have offered concessions to ensure he would not leave empty-handed. Other diplomats expressed scepticism.
Kerry and Lavrov spoke by phone on Thursday, and Russia said the two discussed "taking into account existing Russian and US proposals to normalise the atmosphere and provide for civil peace".
The UK prime minister, David Cameron, and the foreign secretary, William Hague, will meet Kerry before his meeting with Lavrov. A Foreign Office spokesman said Hague had phoned both Kerry and Lavrov to encourage them "to hold talks in London with a view to de-escalating the situation in Crimea and setting up dialogue between Russia and Ukraine".
As part of a series of moves aimed at displaying solidarity with Ukraine, Nato was planning on Friday to meet representatives of the Tatar population in the Crimea who are largely hostile to a Russian takeover. Nato's deputy secretary general, Alexander Vershbow, will meet the Ukrainian MP and leader of the Crimean Tatars, Mustafa Cemilev Kirimoglu.
One person was killed and several were treated for injuries on Thursday evening, when hundreds of pro- and anti-Moscow demonstrators clashed in the eastern city of Donetsk.
