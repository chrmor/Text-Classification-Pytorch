Dragan Vasiljkovic: Former Serbian commander indicted for war crimes in Croatia
Former Serbian paramilitary commander Dragan Vasiljkovic has been indicted for war crimes in Croatia six months after being extradited from Australia.
Vasiljkovic was charged with murdering and torturing civilians and prisoners of war during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s.
Croatian prosecutors also alleged that he orchestrated an attack in 1991 on the town of Glina, in which at least one civilian and a German journalist were killed.
Last year the former commander lost a nine-year battle not to be extradited to Croatia from Australia, where he lived in Perth under the name Daniel Snedden and worked as a golf instructor.
In November 2012, former federal justice minister Jason Clare approved the Australian citizen's extradition and the Federal Court backed that ruling in December.
Snedden applied for leave to appeal in the High Court, arguing the approval was improper based on procedural fairness and sections of the Geneva convention.
However, the High Court has ruled the appeal would be unlikely to succeed and has refused leave to appeal.
It was the last option left to Snedden through the courts.
A statement on the Federal Attorney-General's Department website at the time said: "Mr Vasiljkovic was provisionally arrested in Australia in January 2006".
"Since that time, Mr Vasiljkovic has exercised his right to challenge the extradition process in 13 separate matters. This included several unsuccessful applications to the High Court of Australia," the statement read.
"Criminal proceedings against Mr Vasiljkovic in Croatia are a matter for Croatian authorities."
