Pakistan players at centre of match-fixing probe after police make arrest during Lord's Test
World cricket is in turmoil in the wake of claims that four Pakistan players have been involved in an alleged betting scam during the fourth Test against England at Lord's.
The alleged spot-fixing scandal overshadowed Sunday's action at Lord's, where England secured the series by winning the fourth and final Test by an innings and 225 runs.
Scotland Yard have launched an investigation into accusations that pace bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir colluded with fixers by bowling no-balls to order.
Pakistan captain Salman Butt and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal are also alleged to have been involved.
Spot-fixing differs from outright match-fixing in one crucial regard - whereas match-fixing sees the entire result of a sporting contest manipulated, spot-fixing relates to specific incidents within the game. As such, it can take just one member of a team to facilitate a fix, rather than requiring the complicity of key players, making a con harder to detect as well as more cost-effective. The claims concern the timing of no-balls, with certain Pakistan bowlers alleged by the newspaper to have deliberately overstepped the crease on pre-determined occasions. Markets on no-balls and wides are among those which may be easy to manipulate, with little effort required to produce 'errors' at the prescribed moment. While the nature of cricket produces a proliferation of the kind of incidents favoured by spot-fixers, the problem is by no means confined to one particular sport. Markets on the number of corners or the time of the first throw-in or free-kick in a football match provide further examples of areas open to exploitation. Former Southampton forward Matt Le Tissier admitted in his autobiography, Taking Le Tiss, that he had attempted to take advantage of spread betting markets in a 1995 game against Wimbledon by making money on the time of the first throw-in. Le Tissier 'bought' the under one minute time slot and attempted to spray the ball out of play directly from the kick-off - but team-mate Neil Shipperley, unaware of the bet, kept the underhit pass in play and unwittingly sparked a frantic dash by Le Tissier and a co-conspirator to get the ball out of play and reduce their losses.
Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed has revealed three players including team captain Salman Butt had their mobile telephones confiscated by police on Saturday night.
Saeed, who said the tour would continue with one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches against England, told Sky Sports News the players gave up their telephones to officers.
'Telephones yes, only these three gentlemen. The police have taken their mobile phones away,' Saeed said, adding that the players were 'the skipper (Butt), and Asif and the third one was Mohammed Aamer'.
35, was arrested on Saturday night on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers.
An ICC statement read: 'The International Cricket Council, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the Pakistan Cricket Board have been informed by the Metropolitan Police that a 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers.
'The Metropolitan Police have informed the ICC, ECB and PCB that their investigations continue and ICC, ECB and PCB, with the involvement of the ICC Anti Corruption and Security Unit, are fully assisting those enquiries .
'No players nor team officials have been arrested in relation to this incident and the fourth npower Test match will continue as scheduled on Sunday. As this is now subject to a police investigation neither ICC, ECB , PCB nor the ground authority, the MCC, will make any further comment.'
Pakistan were late arrivals at Lord's on Sunday as the storm overshadowed day four of the fourth and final Test. The team bus backed into the players' car park at 10am - just an hour before the start of play.
Pakistan chose to enter the changing rooms via a circuitous route through the Lord's ticket office and museum. Like the umpires and match officials before them, they therefore avoided eye and vocal contact with anyone other than groundstaff.
The practice of fixing the outcome of specific deliveries is known as spot-fixing and has been claimed to have accounted for millions of dollars in illegal betting markets, mainly in the Far East.
World cricket's governing body, the International Cricket Conference, have pledged 'full co-operation' to the Metropolitan Police, who are understood to have interviewed several Pakistan players during the fourth Test.
But on Saturday night a spokesman for the Pakistan team denied all the allegations, stressing it was 'business as usual' for the side as they try to stage an incredible comeback.
An ICC spokesman said last night: 'ICC can confirm we are aware of allegations concerning the current Test match between England and Pakistan and an investigation by the Metropolitan Police. ICC has a zero tolerance policy and will co-operate in any way possible.'
There is no suggestion that the Pakistan team or any individuals players have sought to throw the match against England or have agreed to try to fix the result. But the practice of spotfixing has long been under investigation by the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit (ACSU). On his retirement as head of ACSU, Lord Condon warned of the danger to the integrity of world cricket still posed by spot-fixing.
The latest allegations name London-based Majeed as accepting Â£150,000 to persuade Amir, who took six wickets in the England first innings, and fellow opening bowler Asif to deliver three no-balls to order for a million-dollar betting syndicate.
Contrary to ICC protocol, no Pakistan player was presented for interview after the match on Saturday and sources claimed that they made a hasty exit from Lord's as they were aware that the allegations were about to break.
Those looking for possible clues cited one no-ball delivered by Amir, photographs of which show the bowler's front foot landing at least 12 inches over the crease.
At their team hotel in north London, bowler Asif said: 'I have spoken to the management and they have told us something happened but not what. The management will tell us more later. We are 100 per cent focused on the match.'
The allegations come as a bitter blow to the integrity of world cricket, whose leaders have claimed that the worst days of betting scandals were in the past.
The England and Wales Cricket Board must also fear that the Pakistan Board may react by calling off the remainder of the tour.
England and Pakistan are due to play two Twenty20 matches starting next Sunday, followed by five one-day internationals. With most of those matches sold out, a cancellation of the rest of the tour would leave the ECB having to pay out millions of pounds in compensation.
They in turn would undoubtedly press the Pakistan Cricket Board for reparation.
Four years ago Pakistan forfeited the final Test at The Oval after captain Inzamam Ul Haq and his players refused to resume the match following the imposition of a five-run penalty for ball-tampering by Australian umpire Darrel Hair.
Since 1992, Pakistan cricket history has been scarred by controversies and scandals from match-fixing, drug issues and the Bob Woolmer 'murder' probe at the 2007 World Cup, in which several players were under suspicion before all allegations were dropped.
Earlier this year, Pakistan's controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who has flown to England for the one-day series and Twenty20 internationals starting next Sunday, claimed Pakistan could not afford any more scandals or controversies.
He said there was urgent need for the Pakistan Cricket Board to play a 'father figure' to the players.
'Match fixing has hurt us terribly,' he said. 'I don't think our cricket can afford any more controversies.'
