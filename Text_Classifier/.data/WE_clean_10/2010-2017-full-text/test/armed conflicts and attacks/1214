At least 28 people have been killed in an airstrike Thursday on a refugee camp in Syria, according to a British-based monitoring group.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are women and children among the casualties and the number of dead at the camp near the town of Sarmada was expected to rise.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the situation heartbreaking and said it was too early to tell if Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces was behind the attack, according to the AP.
The airstrike came hours after the United States and Russia said they agreed to extend a cease-fire to include the northern city of Aleppo.
The State Department said the truce went into effect in Aleppo city and province at 00:01 Damascus time Wednesday.
Mark C. Toner, deputy spokesman for the department, said in a statement Wednesday that there had been an overall decrease in violence in Aleppo since the truce began, "even though there have been reports of continued fighting in some locations."
The Syrian military said the cessation of hostilities would last 48 hours, the AP reported.
"Our objective remains, and has always been, a single nationwide cessation of hostilities covering all of Syria – not a series of local truces," Toner said.
