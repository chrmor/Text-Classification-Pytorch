Southern Sudan stronghold seized as border clashes escalate
Officials in Khartoum are claiming to have seized an area sympathetic to South Sudan as clashes spread along the border yesterday.
A South Sudan military official said the clashes were a "terrible escalation" of the conflict that stretched back to before it split from Sudan last year.
Fighting along the north-south border has been near constant over the past two weeks. The Sudan Media Centre reported yesterday that Sudan's army took control of Mugum, a stronghold of the southern forces.
