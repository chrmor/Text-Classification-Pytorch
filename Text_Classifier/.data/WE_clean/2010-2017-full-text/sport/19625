Yamaico Navarro, voted the Korean Series MVP, belted a three-run home run in the top of the sixth inning, his record-tying fourth home run of the Korean Series, and drove in five runs himself, as the Lions provided more than enough offense for starter Yun Sung-hwan.

They blew a 1-0 lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth in Monday's Game 5, and failed to regroup in time to stave off elimination on Tuesday.The Lions were befuddled by Nexen starter Oh Jae-young through the first two innings, with no hits and four strikeouts against the left-hander.The Lions then exploded for four runs in the top of the third to break open the game. After a single, an error and a walk loaded the bases with one out, Chae Tae-in lined a two-run single to right, chasing Oh from the game.Facing the new pitcher, Moon Sung-hyun, with men at the corners, Choi Hyoung-woo sent a double to right-center field gap to bring both runners home, staking the Lions to a 4-0 lead.After being held hitless by Samsung starter Yun Sung-hwan through the first three innings, the Heroes finally solved the right-hander in the bottom of the fourth.Seo Geon-chang led off with a single and came around to score on a double by the next batter, Lee Taek-keun.With their No. 3, 4 and 5 hitters due up, the Heroes failed to cut further into the deficit. Yoo Han-joon grounded out to first, while Park Byung-ho struck out swinging and Kang Jung-ho flied out to right.The Lions failed to pad their lead after loading the bases with two outs in the fifth, as Kim Hun-gon grounded into a force play at second.The Lions soon would have another chance and didn't miss it the second time.Cho Sang-woo, Nexen's third pitcher, hit Lee Ji-young to start the sixth. Kim Sang-su laid down a bunt to move Lee over to second, but first baseman Park Byung-ho slipped and fell trying to field the ball, leaving both runners safe.Navarro then stepped up and drilled a 1-2 fastball over the left-center field wall, putting the Lions up 7-1.Navarro, who hit 31 home runs in the regular season from the leadoff spot, tied Tyrone Woods of the 2001 Doosan Bears for the most home runs in a single Korean Series.
