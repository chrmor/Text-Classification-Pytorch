At least 118 people were killed in a car bomb attack in the central Nigerian city of Jos, the country's relief agency said on Tuesday, warning that the death toll could rise further.
"The exact figure of the dead bodies recovered as of now is 118," Mohammed Abdulsalam, coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in the city, told AFP.
He added that "more bodies may be in the debris" of buildings which collapsed due to the intensity of the blasts.
