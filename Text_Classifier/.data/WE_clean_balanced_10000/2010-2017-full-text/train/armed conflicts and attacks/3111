MOSCOW, November 7 (RIA Novosti) - Five people died after a Moscow lawyer spurned by a colleague went on a drunken shooting rampage at a warehouse in northeast Moscow on Wednesday morning, investigators said.
"At around 10 a.m., seven people were shot at a warehouse on Chermanskaya Street. Five were killed, two were injured," a police source said.
Police say they have arrested a suspect, named as Dmitry Vinogradov, 30, who worked at the company.
“The gunman was a lawyer at the firm at this address. He has told investigators he was in love with a pharmacist at the company, but it was unrequited. So he went on a five-day drinking binge, and today came to work and started shooting. The girl in question is among the victims,” a police source said.
Vinogradov opened fire simultaneously with two carbines, one in each hand, an investigator told RIA Novosti.
“He opened fire from both hands on his colleagues sitting at their workplaces, from a Saiga and a Benelli carbine,” he said.
Three of the dead were men and two women, he said.
“The injured survivors are a woman and young man, who are getting medical treatment,” he added. Previously, police sources said there was only one injured survivor.
The injured man is in grave condition with multiple gunshot wounds. The women, who is believed to be the object of the shooter's advances, is in serious condition.
The gunman was initially held by the company’s own security staff, the investigator said
