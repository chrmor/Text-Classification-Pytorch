CAIRO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - United Nations-backed peace talks aimed at ending eight months of civil war in Yemen between an Iranian-allied militia group and the embattled Saudi-backed government will convene on Dec. 15, Saudi-owned TV quoted Yemen's foreign minister as saying.
"Consultations on the implementation of Resolution 2216 will be held on Dec. 15," the network quoted Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi as saying in a news flash, referring to a U.N. Security Council decision calling for Yemen's dominant Houthi militia to quit major cities.
