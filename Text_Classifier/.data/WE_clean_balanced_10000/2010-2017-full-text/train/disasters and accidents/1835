Death toll from massive landslide in Guatemala rises to 253, hundreds more still missing
Guatemala City: At least 253 bodies have been recovered after a massive landslide buried part of a town in Guatemala last week, with 374 people still unaccounted for, national disaster agency Conred said on Friday.
After heavy rains, a hillside collapsed onto Santa Catarina Pinula on the south-eastern edge of Guatemala City on October 1, burying more than 100 homes under tons of earth, rock and trees.
Entire families were buried alive and hundreds of rescue workers have spent the past week trying to dig out bodies.
About 40 families still living in the area have been given official notice that they must leave.
