Three more Syrian generals defect to Turkey, diplomat says
Three more Syrian generals have crossed into Turkey, bringing to 24 the number of generals who have fled the unrest in Syria, a Foreign Ministry diplomat told AFP Friday.
"Ten officers including one general fled to Turkey overnight" [Thursday to Friday], said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
And "two brigadier generals crossed Friday," he added.
Turkey has given sanctuary to dozens of defectors who have formed the Free Syrian Army in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Turkey is sheltering more than 43,000 Syrian refugees who have fled the violence and been accommodated in camps near the border. The camps also shelter rebel forces made up of army defectors.
