Hurricane Harvey Makes Landfall Near Corpus Christi, Tex.
CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex. — Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the Central Texas coast as a Category 4 storm late Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center, which warned of catastrophic flooding from the storm surge and torrential rains.
The eye of the storm swept ashore with 130-mile-per-hour winds about 9:45 p.m. between Port Aransas and Port O’Connor, just northeast of Corpus Christi. But as the center of the storm moved to the northeast toward Victoria and other inland cities, the danger was just starting.
“Even though #Harvey has made landfall, the rainfall threat is only beginning,” the National Hurricane Center said in a Twitter message.
Later, the storm made a second landfall — on the Northeastern Shore of Copano Bay. The hurricane was downgraded to a Category 3, with 125 m.p.h. winds.
