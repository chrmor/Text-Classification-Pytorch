Hurricane Joaquin Intensifies on Way to Bahamas
A hurricane approaching the Bahamas and with the potential to strike the United States strengthened late Wednesday, forecasters said.
Hurricane Joaquin grew to a Category 3 hurricane Wednesday night, as maximum sustained winds increased to 115 mph from 85 mph over the course of the day, the National Weather Service said. Joaquin was about 90 miles east of San Salvador as of 11 p.m. ET and it was moving to the southwest at around 6 mph.
Hurricane warnings were expanded for parts of the Bahamas Wednesday as the storm approached the islands, and the governors of Virginia and North Carolina were urging residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.
The hurricane was expected to pass near the islands of San Salvador, Cat Island, Eleuthera and Rum Cay on Thursday, close enough that it could bring tropical-storm-force winds, storm surges, coastal flooding and 5-10 inches of rain, said Geoffrey Greene, a senior forecaster with the Bahamas Meteorology Department.
"We would be very concerned about them," Greene said of the eastern islands.
The American forecast model predicts Joaquin will veer northwestward, ramming into Virginia, Maryland or North Carolina this weekend. But the European forecast model suggests Joaquin will avoid the East Coast entirely.
