An explosive hearing into a territorial row between Thailand and Cambodia began on Monday at the UN's International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, lying between the two countries, has been the focus of an ownership battle which has seen tense fighting on the border.
Tensions have calmed after both sides pulled out soldiers from the territory and replaced them with police and security guards last year.
The ICJ awarded the temple site to Cambodia in 1962, but did not specify who had ownership over an adjacent 4.6-square-kilometre block of land.
Thailand's Ambassador to the Netherlands, Virachai Plasai, has told the ABC he believes the dispute over the land only became an issue when UNESCO gave the site world heritage status in 2007.
"I think the real cause of this is the decision made by Cambodia to go alone trying to inscribe the temple on the World Heritage list," Mr Plasai said.
"Before that time there were plans to jointly nominate the temple as a property, while the area around would be under Thai sovereignty and then we would manage this together."
The origins of the dispute stem from maps drawn during French colonial disengagement in the early 20th century.
Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesman Koy Kuong is leading the Cambodian delegation and says all he wants is a fair outcome.
"What we want is justice," he said.
"We do not want anything from the other side and we do not want to lose what we own legally."
A ruling is not expected until September.
