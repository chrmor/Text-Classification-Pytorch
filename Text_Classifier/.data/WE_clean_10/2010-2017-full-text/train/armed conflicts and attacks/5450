I stopped World War III, says James Blunt
James Blunt says he stopped World War III from happening by disobeying a general's order.
The singer, who served in the British army for six years, told the BBC yesterday he refused an order to seize an airfield during NATO's 1999 intervention in Kosovo after the Russians got to it first.
"It was a mad situation anyway," he told BBC Radio 5Live.
"We had 200 Russians lined up pointing their weapons at us aggressively and we've been told to reach the airfield and take a hold of it."
Blunt was a 25-year-old cavalry officer at that time and the head of his unit, which was leading a column of 30,000 NATO troops.
