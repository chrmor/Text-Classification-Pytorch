13 dead, 31 others injured in tour bus crash near Palm Springs. 'Everyone, dead and alive, was covered with blood'
The front of the white tour bus was crumpled and largely destroyed, suggesting the bus was traveling much faster than the truck, officials said. They cautionedÂ that it was too early to say whether the bus driver, who died in the crash, was speeding.
