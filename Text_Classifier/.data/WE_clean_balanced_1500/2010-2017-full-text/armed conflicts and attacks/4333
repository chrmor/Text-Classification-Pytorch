KABUL, Afghanistan -- A bomb blast in southern Afghanistan fatally wounded a American soldier Tuesday,Â  the U.S. military said in a statement.
Officials provided no further details beyond the statement, which read: "A U.S. Forces-Afghanistan service member died of wounds following an improvised explosive device attack in southern Afghanistan today."
The incident followed an attack Monday by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle against a joint patrol by Afghan and coalition forces in the eastern city of Khowst that left at least 20 people dead, including three soldiers whom Afghan authorities identified as American.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization declined to give the nationality of the dead military personnel.
