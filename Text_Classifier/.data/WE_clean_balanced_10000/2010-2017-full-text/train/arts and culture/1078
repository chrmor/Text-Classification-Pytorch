BBC to axe Ready Steady Cook after 15 years and 2000 episodes
READY Steady Cook - Britain's longest-running cookery show - is being axed by Beeb bosses.
The daytime show once pulled in three million viewers and made original host Fern Britton a household name.
But in recent years, it has gone off the boil, attracting audiences of just 1.5million.
Ainsley Harriott, who has presented the show since 2000 and worked on it as a chef previously, said last night: "I feel privileged to have been part of the Ready Steady Cook family for 15 years.
"I am immensely proud of its success and will look back on it with the fondest of memories."
Ready Steady Cook featured guests who brought in a carrier bag with Â£5 worth of ingredients to be turned into meals by the chefs.
No more episodes will be made and after some repeats go out in 2011, the series will be taken off air for good.
The programme will be replaced by other cooking shows featuring stars including the Hairy Bikers - David Myers and Simon King - who will host a new cook-off programme.
The move to axe Ready Steady Cook is part of a plan by BBC's head of daytime, Liam Keelan, to revamp the schedule.
Keelan said: "After 15 years, 21 series and nearly 2000 episodes, Ready Steady Cook has hung up its cooking aprons.
"I'm proud of the show, which will go down in history as the longest running cookery show on TV.
"While the series has been hugely popular on BBC Two, it was felt that Ready Steady Cook has been taken as far as it could."
The show's format has been sold to 25 countries around the world , including the US.
