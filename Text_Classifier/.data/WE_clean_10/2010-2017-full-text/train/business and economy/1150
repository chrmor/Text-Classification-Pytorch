U.S. Data Dog Asia Markets
HONG KONGâ€”Asian stocks slumped Monday with Japan's Topix Index tumbling to its lowest level since 1983 after poor unemployment data in the U.S. cast further doubts over the health of the global economy.
The Topix, a broader measure of Japanese equities than the export-weighted Nikkei, finished at 695.51, down 1.9%. Japan and Australia fell to levels not seen since November last year, as the sell-off increased in intensity.
