North Korea fires missiles into the sea
North Korea fired two short-range missiles off the coast of the Korean Peninsula early Wednesday, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said.
North Korea did not declare a no-fly zone prior to the launch, the official said. No damage or injures were reported.
The projectiles, assumed to be short-range ballistic missiles, flew more than 310 miles (almost 500 kilometers), the official said.
The official said the missiles were launched from North Korea's western Hwanghae Province and flew northeast toward the water.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered his cabinet to look into the apparent launch. The Japanese government intends to lodge an official protest with the North Korean government.
North Korea has carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea in recent months, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations.
