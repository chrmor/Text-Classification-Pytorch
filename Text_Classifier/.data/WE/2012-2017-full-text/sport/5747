In his first start of the season, Rangers starter Yu Darvish threw 8 2/3 perfect innings against the Astros in Houston in a 7-0 win for Texas. The 26-year-old Darvish struck out 14 batters in the game.
With his pitch count escalating, Darvish got designated hitter Jason Castro to ground out to the shortstop to start the ninth inning. Catcher Carlos Corporan followed with a ground out to second base. But on Darvish's first pitch to shortstop Marwin Gonzalez -- his 111th pitch of the evening -- Gonzalez smacked a ground-ball base hit up the middle. Rangers manager Ron Washington pulled the pitcher after he allowed the first Astros' hit of the night.
Rangers reliever Michael Kirkman allowed a hit to second baseman Jose Altuve, but struck out pinch-hitter J.D. Martinez to end the game and preserve the shutout.
The Astros were on the wrong end of a perfect game last June, when the San Francisco Giants' Matt Cain victimized them in one of the most dominant pitching performances ever.
Rangers catcher A.J. Pierzynski caught Philip Humber's perfect game at Safeco Field in Seattle on April 21, 2012 while a member of the Chicago White Sox. He also caught Mark Buehrle's no-hitter on April 18, 2007.
To date, there have been 23 perfect games in major league history. The most recent came from the Mariners' Felix Hernandez on Aug. 15, 2012.
Darvish signed a six-year, $56 million contract with the Rangers last offseason after pitching in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league for five seasons. He went 76-28 with a 1.72 ERA for his career in Japan.
