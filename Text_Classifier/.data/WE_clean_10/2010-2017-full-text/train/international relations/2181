Madagascar: Regional Leaders Call for Deposed President's Return
Southern African leaders have called on Madagascar's rulers to allow exiled leaders, including the deposed president, Marc Ravalomanana, to return home. However, the country's administration is reported to have rejected the call.
In a communique issued after a summit of the Southern African Development Community in Johannesburg at the weekend, the leaders called for the country to be urgently returned to "constitutional normalcy".
To that end, the summit:
Madagascar has been ruled for the last two years by an administration under former Antananarivo mayor Andry Rajoelina, which seized power from Ravalomanana.
On Monday Bloomberg News quoted Harry Rahajason, Rajoelina's minister of communications, as rejecting the return of Ravalomanana.
"We will not sign an amended roadmap," Rahajason reportedly said. "We've already got our constitution."
The section of the summit communique dealing with Madagascar read:
