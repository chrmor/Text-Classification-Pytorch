Rwanda committed to African peace
Rwanda has strong belief in her soldiersâ€™ ability to maintain peace in Sudan as the second largest troop contributor to the AU-UN hybrid Mission in Darfur (Unamid) after Nigeria.
As some of African Union members sat and watched, Rwanda was not ready to see Sudan suffer in war.
Last week, after 100 Rwanda Defense Force peacekeepers arrived from El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, an equal number left Kigali to replace them.
The rest of African Union members should follow suit and send their soldiers, a burden they have left to a few countries.
All this is happening when a UN report, which alleges that Rwandan troops were involved in mass killings in the DRC between 1994 and 2003, has been leaked.
The soldiers have vowed to continue with their mission that started from 1994. Bravo! Rwandan soldiers, you are an exemplary army in your work ethic and discipline. The Unamid force commander is a Rwandan, Lieutenant General Patrick Nyamvumba.
