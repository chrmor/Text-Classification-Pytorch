Euro 2012: Samir Nasri argues with journalist after France loss
France midfielder Samir Nasri became involved in a row with a French journalist after his side's Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat by Spain.
The clash occurred in the Donbass Arena after the Manchester City player was asked for his reaction to the result.
Nasri reportedly called the journalist a "son of a bitch" and repeatedly complained about the media's behaviour.
The 24-year-old, a substitute in the game, added: "There, now you'll be able to say I've been badly brought up."
Two goals from Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso brought an end to France's campaign in Poland and Ukraine.
Manager Laurent Blanc bemoaned the early goal his side conceded against a team he believed "were there for the taking".
"The only thing I regret is that they scored off their first chance," the 46-year-old said.
"If we had gone in 0-0 at half-time, I think we would have had more room in the second half."
Blanc fielded two right-backs with Anthony Reveillere in the defensive position and Mathieu Debuchy pushed up into midfield to stem Spain's threat on their left flank, but his plan did not have the desired effect.
First, Real Madrid midfielder Alonso headed the holders into a 19th-minute lead following some excellent work down that side by Valencia full-back Jordi Alba.
Then a clumsy challenge from Reveillere in injury time allowed Alonso to score his second goal from the penalty spot.
"We had analysed the Spanish line-up well because they had two very strong players on the left but the most frustrating thing is that we conceded the goal from that side," Blanc added.
The addition of Reveillere at the expense of midfielder Nasri took much of the sting out of the French side's attack and their only shot on target came in the 32nd minute when Newcastle United's Yohan Cabaye saw his free-kick tipped over by Iker Casillas.
"I think the boys gave their all," Blanc told TF1. "Against Spain, it's hard.
"It is very difficult to create danger for them. They are so tough to beat - you have to be very clinical when you only get 30-35% of the possession."
