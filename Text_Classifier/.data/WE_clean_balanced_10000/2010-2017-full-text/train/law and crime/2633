Video: Norway killings: police revise Norway death toll to 76
Police told a news conference on Monday the confirmed death toll at Otoeya now stands at 68. At the same time people killed in the bomb attack was raised to eight.
"This figure of 68 is a decrease compared to earlier numbers of deaths given," National Police Commissioner, Oeystein Maeland said.
"What I would like to say in this connection is that the police and other rescue personnel had a very demanding job on the island just after they arrived and it was necessary to give priority to those who were injured and to secure the whole area. In this complex situation the number of deaths first reported were too high," Maeland added.
He said some of the dead bodies might have been counted twice in the chaos.
"The dead people were lying partly in heaps and it might have been that some victims were counted twice. It's hard to tell exactly what the reason for this wrong number. But I think the situation was chaotic as I said and that the priority was given to help those who were injured made the number uncertain," Maeland said.
Norwegian police are not ruling out that gunman Anders Behring Breivik had help from others in his gun and bomb attacks.
Earlier on Monday, Breivik told a court in Oslo that "there are two more cells in our organisation", according to the judge who ordered him to solitary confinement.
Norwegian police said Breivik had said during interrogation that he was prepared to spend the rest of his life in prison.
