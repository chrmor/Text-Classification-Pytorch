Earlier in the broadcast, Starr performed solo and played “Photograph” from his 1973 album,Ringo. Backed by a massive full band, he bounced around the stage while old black-and-white photographs showed on a big screen behind him.
Tonight’s reunion is one of only a handful of times McCartney and Starr have performed together. On the red carpet earlier, Starr mentioned that the two had played together just last week. Before then, known performances includeStarr’s 70th birthday bash in 2010and at a David Lynch benefit in New York Cityback in 2009. Rumors have persisted since the Grammy performances were leaking out that they’d reunite for a performance, but nothing was confirmed until tonight.
McCartney has won 16 Grammys: 10 with the Beatles (including Best New Artist in 1965 and this year's Lifetime Achievement Award, which he shares with Starr), four as a solo act and two with Wings. Earlier in the evening, he won the Grammy for Best Rock Song for "Cut Me Some Slack," his song with Dave Grohl, Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic.
