Vatican Arrests 2 in Connection With Leaked Documents
The revelations of widespread infighting and power struggles at the Vatican are considered to have helped precipitate Benedict’s resignation. Echoes of that scandal, called “VatiLeaks” by the news media, reverberated last month when an Italian newspaper announced that Pope Francis had a treatable brain tumor, a report that the Vatican denied and called an attempt to undermine him.
The Vatican said Monday that the coming books were “the fruit of a grave betrayal of the pope’s trust.” The authors of the books have been warned that the Vatican’s legal offices are considering action.
“Publications of this kind do not contribute in any way to the establishment of clarity and truth, but rather to the creation of confusion and partial and tendentious interpretations,” the Vatican said in the statement. “We must absolutely avoid the mistake of thinking that this is a way to help the mission of the pope.”
In an interview, Mr. Fittipaldi, the author of “Avarice” and an investigative journalist for the newsweekly L’Espresso, called the arrests on Monday “abnormal” and said it was no coincidence that they had taken place just before the publication of two books that probe the inner workings of one of the world’s most secretive institutions.
“The arrests are a way not to talk about the content of the books, but about moles and intrigue, and whether they are the sources or not,” Mr. Fittipaldi said in a telephone interview.
His book, he said, described a Vatican that is very different from Pope Francis’ vision of a church for the poor. Mr. Fittipaldi declined to give details from his book before its publication, but he noted that he had looked into the lavish lifestyles of cardinals, and financial investments in companies in the United States and Luxembourg.
