Bali bombing suspect Umar Patek arrives in Jakarta
A KEY suspect in the 2002 Bali bombings has arrived in the Indonesian capital after authorities extradited him from Pakistan, officials say.
Umar Patek allegedly built the bombs used in the suicide attacks on Bali nightclubs that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, in 2002.
Patek, an Indonesian national, had a $US1 million ($985,000) bounty on his head when he was captured in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on January 25, four months before Osama bin Laden was killed there in a US commando raid.
Indonesia sent a plane yesterday to pick up the 41-year-old Patek from a Pakistani air force base just outside the capital, Islamabad, said a Pakistani intelligence official.
The extradition was confirmed by senior Pakistani security and government officials.
Patek arrived in Jakarta this morning, an Indonesian anti-terrorism official said.
Indonesian anti-terrorism chief Ansyaad Mbai told The Associated Press yesterday that Patek would stand trial in Indonesia.
Indonesian officials say Patek has confessed to playing a role in the 2002 Bali bombings, but have nevertheless expressed concern over whether they will be able to ensure a conviction.
One potential problem is that he may not be able to be tried under anti-terror laws passed after the Bali blasts because they cannot be applied retroactively.
Patek's arrest in Abbottabad has raised questions over whether he was in the town to meet bin Laden, something that would challenge theories that the al-Qaeda chief was cut off from his followers.
US officials have said his arrest in Abbottabad was a coincidence.
