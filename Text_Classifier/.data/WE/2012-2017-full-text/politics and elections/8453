Harry Reid Is Hospitalized
WASHINGTON — Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was hospitalized Friday after falling ill in the morning, his office said.
Mr. Reid, who just turned 74, was going to remain in the hospital as a precaution. As a result, he will not be presiding over the Senate’s final day of business this year.
The Senate, which has been going through a tumultuous last two weeks as Republicans and Democrats feuded over nominations and legislation, resolved the stalemate late Thursday night and agreed to finish up on Friday. Senators will return in early January.
Mr. Reid’s spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said the senator’s condition had improved.
“Early this morning, Senator Reid was not feeling well and as a precaution decided to go to the hospital,” he said. “Tests have been conducted and everything is normal. He is alert, resting and feeling better.
“Doctors have asked that he remain in the hospital for observation so he will not be working today.”
