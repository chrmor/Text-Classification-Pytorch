Nelson Mandela discharged from hospital
Johannesburg - Former president Nelson Mandela has been discharged after spending nine days in hospital, the presidency said on Saturday.
"Former president Nelson Mandela has been discharged from hospital today, April 6, following a sustained and gradual improvement in his general condition," spokesperson Mac Maharaj said.
"The former president will now receive home based high care."
Maharaj said President Jacob Zuma extended his gratitude to all South Africans and people around the world for their support.
"President Zuma thanks the hard working medical team and hospital staff for looking after Madiba so efficiently," he said.
Mandela was admitted to hospital on 27 March with pneumonia.
Since then the 94-year-old former statesman has had fluid drained from his lungs to ease his breathing.
Mandela has fought back from lung ailments before.
According to the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1988, after he had been transferred out of Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison.
His most recent treatments for lung ailments included a hospital stay in December last year.
