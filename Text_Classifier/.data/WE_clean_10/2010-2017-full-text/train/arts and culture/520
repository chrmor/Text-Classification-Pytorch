Rare Harry Potter pages displayed
Original handwritten manuscripts by Harry Potter author JK Rowling are going on display as part of a book festival in the south of Scotland.
The two framed pages, containing The Ballad of Nearly Headless Nick, will be on display at the Wigtown festival.
The story was originally written as part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets but edited out before publication.
The Wigtown Book Festival runs from 24 September to 3 October.
The manuscripts will be displayed at ReadingLasses bookshop.
They were donated by Rowling to the Scottish Language Dictionaries in 2005 to help fund a new Scottish language dictionary.
Now in the hands of prominent book collector and owner of Asia Literary Review, Ilyas Khan, the manuscripts have not previously been displayed in public.
Ilyas Khan said: "The Asia Literary Review has supported a number of literary festivals but I must say that I am particularly pleased to see us in Wigtown.
"Being able to work with the festival organisers to display the Rowling manuscript of Nearly Headless Nick is a neat way of helping to promote the event as a whole."
Gerrie Douglas-Scott, of ReadingLasses, said: "This is a one-off exhibition and contrary to belief it is not on a world tour.
"We're very excited that this bit of Harry Potter is coming home to Scotland for 10 days."
