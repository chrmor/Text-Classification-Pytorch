ISTANBUL—Turkish authorities seized control of two television stations that have been critical of the government before an election Sunday, as officials expanded a probe of what they allege is a coup plot against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The police arrived about 4 a.m. Wednesday at KanalTurk and Bugun TV television stations’ shared building in Istanbul, breaking chains mounted at the main entrance and using tear gas to disperse protesters who had gathered overnight after news of an impending raid.
