Red Shirt leaders deny terrorism charges
BANGKOK: Leaders of the anti-government Red-Shirt movement have pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, arising from the protests in the Thai capital this year in which 90 people were killed and more than 1900 injured.
After nearly three months in prison, 17 Red Shirt leaders were brought into Bangkok Criminal Court yesterday, barefoot and shackled in leg-irons.
''This is a stupid charge,'' Kokaew Pikulthong said as soldiers led him into the court building. ''This is a political charge.''
The 17 were not charged in open court, but had the charges read to them in a holding cell in the court building.
The government has alleged the protest organisers were committing acts of terrorism because the demonstrations were in breach of a state of emergency declared by the Prime Minister.
The Red Shirts' lawyer, Karom Poltaklang, said all 17 would fight the charges, and they were confident of winning.
