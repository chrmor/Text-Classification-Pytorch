Landslide buries a whole village in Manipur near Myanmar border, 20 dead
IMPHAL: At least 20 people were killed when a landslide buried a whole village in the remote Joupi area of Manipur's Chandel district bordering Myanmar on Saturday , police said. A team of police and rescue workers rushed to the site - Joumol, a small Kuki-dominated hamlet under Khengjoy block. The neighbouring villagers were unable to clear the huge earth masses enveloping the village. "The exact number of casualties would be known after the evacuation work is complete. So far, we have learnt that 20 villagers were killed while one survived in the worst ever landslide in Manipur in the recent times," an official said.
