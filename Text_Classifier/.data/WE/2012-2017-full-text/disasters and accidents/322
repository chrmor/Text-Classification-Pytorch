Philippine quake kills 43, dozens missing
Rescuers in the Philippines are digging through rubble with shovels and their bare hands after a powerful earthquake triggered landslides, collapsed homes and killed dozens of people.
The 6.8-magnitude quake hit a narrow strait between the heavily populated islands of Negros and Cebu around lunchtime on Monday with more than 200 aftershocks, some nearly as strong, causing further panic throughout the day.
Local military chiefs said 43 people were confirmed killed but officials warned the death toll may rise.
Dozens of others are feared injured or are missing with landslides having blocked roads for rescuers in mountainous areas.
"Heavy equipment we've requested from the provincial government has not arrived yet, because the roads and bridges are impassable," said Senior Inspector Alvin Futalan, police chief of Guihulngan town on Negros that was among the most heavily damaged.
"We are using our hands and shovels to search in the rubble," he told AFP.
