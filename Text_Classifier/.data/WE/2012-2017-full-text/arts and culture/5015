Grammy Awards
We have to say the awards were pretty evenly spread across the more genre-specific categories with the likes of The Black Keys, fun., Kelly Clarkson, Frank Ocean and Mumford & Sons all walking away winners.
And of course a special mention goes to Gotye and Kimbra who thrilled - and perhaps surprised - us by winning all three awards that they were nominated for (Record of the Year, Best Alternative Music Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance). The best night in years for Australian music internationally.
