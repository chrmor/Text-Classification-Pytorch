Yemen suicide attack hits Houthi rebel procession
A suicide attack on an Shia Houthi rebel procession in northern Yemen has killed at least two people and wounded 10 others.
Reports say the bomber drove his car into a convoy, which was on its way to attend the funeral of a Houthi spiritual leader, Bader al-Deen Houthi.
The attack took place on the route from Saada to Dahyan in the province of Maarib.
This is the second attack of its kind in than three days.
On Wednesday, a car bombing of a Shia religious procession killed 15 and injured 30 people in the northern al-Jawf province.
It is not clear who carried out either attack.
The government and Houthi rebels, members of the Zaidi Shia sect, are currently observing a truce, though there are occasional clashes.
Intermittent fighting in the past six years has killed thousands of people.
The rebels complain of political, social and religious marginalisation, which the government denies.
The UN High Commission for Refugees says more than 300,000 people have fled the fighting in the north, of whom just 20,000 have so far returned to homes in Saada province.
Yemen's weak central government faces rebels in the north and separatists in the south, as well as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
