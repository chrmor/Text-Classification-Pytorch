Nine killed in Misrata fighting; Libya rebels
The dead were said to include fighters and civilians, killed as the rebel-held city in western Libya came under heavy artillery fire from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi.
‘Nine people were killed and 51 wounded, both rebels and civilians,’ rebel officials said in a statement, adding that several of the wounded were in critical condition.
The claim could not immediately be verified, but it came amid reports that the city, nestled on the Mediterranean, was being attacked from three sides.
In Benghazi officials said at least 10 people had been killed there on Saturday during fighting, as well as three others in the fiercely fought-over central city of Ajdabiya — a gateway to the rebel held east.
There were also reports of heavy fighting in the town of Nalut, near the Tunisian border, but the number of casualties were not known.
