Buddhist relics stolen in Karachi
ISLAMABAD -- Illegally excavated Buddhist relics that were recovered by Pakistani police two weeks ago have been stolen from a police station in Karachi, Dawn newspaper reported on Saturday.
The rare pieces dating back to the Gandhara civilisation, which existed more than 2,000 years ago in northwestern Pakistan, were impounded by police after raid on July 6. Dawn reported that the artefacts were "dumped" in a police building in Landhi, where they were left unguarded. It said three statues were missing. A man was photographed walking into the police station and then walking out with the head of a statue. "He allowed the piece to be photographed but took it away with him, saying he could have removed other artefacts as well if they had not been too heavy for him to carry," Dawn reported. Illegal excavations by amateur archaeologists and criminal gangs competing to unearth relics worth millions abroad are threatening centuries-old sites. The Taliban also sought to wipe out traces of the Gandhara civilization. A rare Buddha carving was damaged by the militants in the northwestern Swat region in 2007.
