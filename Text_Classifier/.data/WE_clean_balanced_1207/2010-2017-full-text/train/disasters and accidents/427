Tonga Underwater Volcano Eruption Disrupts Flights
All flights to and from Tonga on Tuesday were canceled due to the underwater eruption, according to The New Zealand Herald. Officials on the island said all flights resumed Wednesday, but some flights from New Zealand were still unable to land, the report added.
Travel woes aside, the eruption has been a fascinating study for local scientists. The volcano, erupting near the uninhabited island HungaÂ Ha'apai, has created a large new island since it started erupting last month, Agence France-Presse reported.
"The new island is more than one kilometre wide, two kilometres long and about 100 metres high," said Tonga's lands and natural resources ministry in a statement.
The AFP also reported officials took a boat trip to the new island and discovered the new island is more than a kilometer wide and two kilometers long. They also observed the volcano erupting about every 5 minutes, spewing ash and rock thousands of feet into the air.
Acid rain and ash are having a negative effect on the nearby islands. Leaves on the trees of Hunga Ha'apai and Hunga Tonga have been killed by the toxic ash and gases, the AFP report also said.
The eruptions have continued through the rest of the week, leading to more flightcancelations, a separate New Zealand Herald report said.
