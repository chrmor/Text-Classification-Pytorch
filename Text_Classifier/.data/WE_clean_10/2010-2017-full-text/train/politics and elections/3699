Plain cigarette packs to 'only show death and disease'
Australia will become the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging, to reduce their appeal to consumers.
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon today released the government's proposed legislation for the initiative as it continues the fight to reduce smoking related deaths in the community.
"This plain packaging legislation is a world first and sends a clear message that the glamour is gone - cigarette packs will now only show the death and disease that can come from smoking," she said.
"The new packs have been designed to have the lowest appeal to smokers and to make clear the terrible effects that smoking can have on your health."
Smoking kills 15,000 Australians a year and costs the community about $31.5 billion annually, the government says.
