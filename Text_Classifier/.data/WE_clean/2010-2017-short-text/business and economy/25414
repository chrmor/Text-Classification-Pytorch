The documents, 2.6 terabytes of information, were obtained more than a year ago from an anonymous source by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Journalists from more than 80 countries have been working with this data. The documents expose holdings of 12 current and former world leaders, and 128 more politicians and public officials worldwide. The national leaders named include Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif; Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, and Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson. (The Guardian)(USA Today)
