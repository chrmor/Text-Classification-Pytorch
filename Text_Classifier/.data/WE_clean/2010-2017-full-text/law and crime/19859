The wife of Thailand's crown prince resigned royal status, palace confirms
The wife of Thailand's crown prince Maha Vajiralongkorn has relinquished her royal title amid a corruption probe of her relatives.
"The king has granted permission to announce that Princess Srirasmi has informed in a written document that she has resigned from her royal status," the palace said in a statement.
It is the first official confirmation of Princess Srirasmi's fall from grace after a string of relatives were arrested in a police corruption scandal.
Thailand has been awash with rumours of her fate for weeks after several of her relatives were caught up in a widening corruption scandal that has sent shockwaves through country's elite.
But reportable facts on Princess Srirasmi's status were scant.
Several high-profile figures have been arrested including a host of senior policemen and military officers, while one of Thailand's richest men is on the run.
The couple have a son who is thought to be Prince Vajiralongkorn's most likely heir.
The country's monarchy is protected by some of the world's strictest lese majeste laws and both local and international media must heavily self-censor when covering the country's royal family.
Earlier this month, the crown prince announced that members of her family had been forbidden from using the surname "Akkharapongpricha", an honorific title given to them following her marriage to the prince.
