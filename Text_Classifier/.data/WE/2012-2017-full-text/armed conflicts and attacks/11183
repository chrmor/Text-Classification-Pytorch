Eleven children killed when mortars hit Damascus school: monitoring group
BEIRUT (Reuters) - At least 11 children were killed in Damascus when mortars fell on a school in an eastern district of the Syrian capital, a monitoring group said on Wednesday.
The attack occurred in Qaboun, a district in the east of the city, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The death toll was expected to rise because a number of those wounded were in critical condition, it said.
