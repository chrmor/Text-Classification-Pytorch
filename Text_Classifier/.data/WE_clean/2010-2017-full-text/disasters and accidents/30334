Severe weather: Alabama governor declares emergency, South braces for more storms
Another round of severe weather with damaging winds is expected to sweep across the South on Wednesday, bringing damaging winds in Alabama and Georgia, according to forecasters.
National Weather Service meteorologist John De Block told the Associated Press he expects storms to start around 4 a.m. Wednesday and last into the evening in southern and western Alabama.
The latest storm system is likely to bring tornadoes, and there's a strong chance of baseball-sized hail.
Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a State of Emergency that will last until severe weather expected to hit the state Wednesday subsides.
Bentley said in a press release that 50 National Guard soldiers will also be deployed in the state. Multiple Alabama schools have also announced that they will be closed Wednesday.
In Georgia, meteorologist Laura Belanger says about 75 percent of the state could experience severe weather around sunrise, and ramp up after 2 p.m. Damaging winds and several tornadoes that could touch down for an extended amount of time from the front.
Belanger says larger cities that could be impacted include Atlanta and Augusta â€” the location of this week's Masters golf tournament.
Most of Georgia is on spring break this week, but the Griffin-Spalding County School System and public schools in Meriwether, which would normally have school on Wednesday, has decided to cancel classes, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.
