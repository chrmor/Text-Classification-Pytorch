Mexico's spectacular Colima volcano eruption captured on webcam as ash and dust plume grows
Mexico's Colima volcano has erupted in spectacular fashion, with the initial explosion sending thick plumes of ash and dust up to five kilometres into the air in just seconds.
The cloud of ash continued to grow and eight hours later measured up to nine kilometres.
Small eruptions were continuing at the site, vulcanologists said, but air traffic control had not been impacted.
The active but isolated volcano is located approximately 500 kilometres west of the capital Mexico City and has erupted at least 30 times since 1585.
The vision was recorded on a permanent fixed webcam operated by Webcams De Mexico, which had placed a series of cameras in the area since the volcano's last major eruptions in 2013 and 2014.
Colima experienced several significant eruptions in the late 1990s and scientific monitoring of the site began two decades ago.
Ash fell on towns up to 25 kilometres away from the volcano, but no lives or properties were under immediate threat.
