Ding downs Robertson to win £100k at PTC Grand Finals
The Chinese player found himself 3-0 down against the former world champion but rattled off four frames in a row to take the bumper winner's cheque of £100,000.
An 88 clearance from Robertson saw him take the first frame after Ding had made a 45 and a break of 58 helped him take the second frame too.
Ding was 55-13 in front in third frame but again Robertson roared back with a half-century clearance helping him make it 3-0.
However, Ding has been in sensational form all tournament and finally found his mojo in the next as breaks of 52 and 70 closed the gap to 3-1.
A total clearance of 130 saw him take the next frame. It was his eight century (including a 147)of the tournament.
Roberston had his chances in the next, but a clearance from yellow to pink saw Ding nick a tight one and send the match to a decider.
The Chinese man took his one big chance in that frame as a break of 98 helped secure him one of the biggest pay days of his career.
Robertson's consolation for finishing second was a cheque for £40,000.
