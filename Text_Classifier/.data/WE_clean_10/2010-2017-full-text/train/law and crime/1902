Soldiers arrest employees of West Bank theater
BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) -- Israeli forces raided the West Bank city of Jenin early Wednesday and arrested two employees from its iconic Freedom Theatre, staff members said.
Adnan Naghnaghiye and Bilal Saadi were taken to an unknown location following the 3:30 a.m. operation, representatives of the Jenin Theatre Foundation said in a statement.
Soldiers also strip-searched night guard Ahmad Nasser Matahen, the statement said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman confirmed that two people were arrested. She said the theater itself was not raided but confirmed the men were taken for questioning.
In April, unknown assailants shot dead the theater's general-director, Juliano Mer-Khamis, 52, an Israeli national, in an unsolved case which has frustrated local security services despite initial claims of success.
Mer-Khamis' late mother founded the theater in the 1980s.
