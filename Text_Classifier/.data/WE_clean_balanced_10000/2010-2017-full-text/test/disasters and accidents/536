Mary River could flood Gympie
PREMIER Anna Bligh says authorities are watching the Mary River in southern Queensland with concern.
It had reached nine metres at Gympie this morning and it could keep on rising to 14 to 15 metres, at which level some businesses would be inundated.
"What we've seen over the northern part of the Sunshine Coast and areas around Gympie is an extraordinary rainfall, with over 300mm overnight in places like Cooroy," Ms Bligh told reporters in Pormpuraaw in far north Queensland.
"That has caused some great deal of havoc on the roads, we've seen multiple swift water rescues and vehicles swept off the road.
"It is very, very distressing circumstances at the moment."
Earlier today a woman was winched from the roof of her house and several others were rescued from floodwater after overnight storms battered the Sunshine Coast.
A rescue helicopter crew winched the woman to safety from her Boreen Point home about 3.30am (AEST).
Firefighters carried out seven swift water rescues at Eumundi, Tewantin, Gympie, Doonan, Noosaville and Cooran, the Department of Community Safety said.
