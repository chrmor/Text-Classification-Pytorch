Gunmen Kill 16 in SW Pakistan Attacks
Pakistani officials say gunmen have killed 16 people in two separate attacks in the restive southwest of the country. Police say the first incident took place Saturday in Aab-e-Ghum, a town near the Baluchistan provincial capital of Quetta. Gunmen stopped a bus, forced some passengers off the vehicle and then killed 10 of them. Police say the victims were all non-ethnic Baluchis from the eastern Punjab province. The second attack occurred in Quetta, where gunmen killed six people. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attacks and it was not clear whether they were linked. Separatists have waged a low-level insurgency in Baluchistan for years, seeking more autonomy for the province and a greater share of the profits from its natural resources. The region is also plagued by sectarian violence.
