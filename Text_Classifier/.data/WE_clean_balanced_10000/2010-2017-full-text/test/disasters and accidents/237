Toronto transformer fire closed highway

Hydro One confirmed that two transformers had caught fire and said there were no injuries or health and safety issues reported as a result the incident.
Traffic on Highway 401 — Canada's busiest thoroughfare —  was stopped in both directions near Highway 427, but the highway was re-opened about 90 minutes after the fire started.
The lights flickered in much of the city when the explosion happened and power was briefly knocked out at Pearson Airport's Terminal 3. An airport spokesman said the fire caused no flight delays or disruptions.
Hydro One said all customers who lost power had it restored by 5:42 p.m.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are not yet known.
