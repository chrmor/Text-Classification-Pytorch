After 11 Years, Case of A.I.G.’s Ex-Chief Is Going to Trial
It will not be the trial of the century. It may just feel as if it has taken that long to get underway.
More than 11 years after civil charges were filed, New York’s case against Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the insurance giant American International Group, goes to trial this week.
The charges date to an era when Eliot Spitzer, then the New York State attorney general, brought a barrage of cases accusing Wall Street research analysts of biased research, mutual fund operators of trading practices that shortchanged average investors, and insurance brokers of bid-rigging and kickbacks.
Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G.’s former chief financial officer, Howard I. Smith, are accused in part of engineering bogus reinsurance transactions in 2000 and 2001 to bolster reserves to make the company’s numbers look better to Wall Street. They are also accused of orchestrating other transactions that allowed A.I.G. to convert insurance losses into investment losses.
