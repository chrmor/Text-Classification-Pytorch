Chinese railway minister sacked, awaits possible arrest
BEIJING: In a rare move, the Chinese government sacked its railway minister Liu Zhijun and announced he is under investigation. He is likely to be arrested and prosecuted. This is a major departure from the usual practice of the party making announcements about investigations against officials long after removing them from their positions. The disciplinary wing of the Communist Party of China, which made the announcement ahead of the annual meeting of the Chinese parliament, has not specified the reason for the investigations apart from charging him for "severe violation of discipline". Most such probes in the past have focused on corruption charges while a few looked into issue of what the party called moral turpitude. Liu, 58, has presided over tremendous growth in China's railway network that includes several high-speed rail lines being laid across the country since 2003. His place in the ministry has been filled by Sheng Guangzu, 62, who is heading the General Administration of Customs. The move follows the party's decision to expel Zhang Jingli, former deputy director of the State Food and Drug Administration. The party's disciplinary wing and the Ministry of Supervision have said Zhang abused his position to benefit others and in return received "a large amount of money" in bribes. Chinese president Hu Jintao recently told the party to gear up for an all-out battle against corruption. In 2010, the party punished 146,517 officials across the country for violating discipline. Among them, 5,098 were leading officials at the county level or above and 804 of them were prosecuted.
