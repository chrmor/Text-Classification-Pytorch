U.N. Agency Says Iran Data Points to A-Bomb Work
The inspectors agreed with a much-debated classified issued in 2007 that Iran had dismantled a highly focused effort to build a bomb in late 2003, but found significant recent work, though conducted in a less coordinated manner.
The report does not claim that Iran has mastered all the necessary technologies, or estimate how long it would take for Iran to be able to produce a nuclear weapon. Inspectors do not point to a single weapons lab, or provide evidence of a fully constructed nuclear weapon. Instead, the report describes roughly a dozen different projects that countries that have built — the United States, , , , , Israel, and — all had to grapple with, in some form. An I.A.E.A. report last May listed five fewer categories of such technical information.
¶ Documents suggesting that Iran “was working on a project to secure a source of uranium suitable for use in an undisclosed enrichment program” to make bomb fuel.
¶ Evidence that Iran “had been provided with nuclear explosive design information.”
¶ Information that it worked on experiments with conventional explosives to compress metal into an incredibly dense mass suitable to start a chain reaction.
¶ Documentation of “at least 14 progressive design iterations” for a missile warhead to deliver an atomic warhead to a distant target.
The report was produced under , a former Japanese diplomat who has run the I.A.E.A. for nearly two years, and addressed to the agency’s board of governors and the . In it, Mr. Amano said that inspectors had amassed “over a thousand pages” of documents, presumably leaked out of Iran. He said they showed “research, development and testing activities” on technologies that would be useful in designing a nuclear weapon.
He said “a number of individuals” involved in Iran’s activities had provided information described as “consistent” with the intelligence from “more than 10” other countries, which it did not name, including some demonstrating Iranian “manufacturing techniques for certain high explosive components.”
A senior Obama administration official briefing reporters on Tuesday pointed to the I.A.E.A.’s evidence of work on detonation systems, including a special type of spherical initiation system that implodes a nuclear core with tremendous precision. “It’s a very telltale sign of nuclear weapons work,” he said.
Iran quickly rejected the report’s findings. “The report of the International Atomic Energy Agency is unbalanced, unprofessional and politically motivated,” Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran’s representative to the I.A.E.A., was quoted as saying by the country’s official Islamic Republic News Agency.
President of Iran said the United Nations agency should instead investigate the United States nuclear arsenal. “If the agency is after the truth, why has it not released any report on the U.S. atomic bombs concealed in 1,000 of its military bases?” Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the semiofficial Fars news agency. Iranian officials have said the evidence is fabricated, and some have warned that any attempt by the West to stop its program, by any means, could invite retaliation.
Mr. Amano said the agency had “tried without success to engage Iran in discussions about the information.” But he said that “Iran continued to conceal nuclear activities,” including its effort to construct a secret enrichment facility near Qum.
Iran told the nuclear agency about that facility days before and European leaders reported its existence two years ago, and Iran has recently said it is moving some of its nuclear activity to that underground facility, at a well-defended military base.
The I.A.E.A. report’s detailed revelations are a fascinating role reversal from 2003, when the United States and Britain claimed Iraq was seeking to rekindle its nuclear program. In that case, the agency warned that the Bush administration’s case was weak and that some of the evidence was forged. Now, it is the normally cautious agency that is taking the lead, arguing that years of study had led it to the conclusion that, despite Iran’s denials, the country engaged in an active program to design nuclear warheads, among other technologies.
“The level of detail is unbelievable,” said a Western diplomat familiar with the report, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing the agency’s internal assessment of the report. “The report describes virtually all the steps to make a nuclear warhead and the progress Iran has achieved in each of those steps. It reads like a menu.”
The new evidence came as no surprise to the Obama administration, which has possessed some of this intelligence for years, but moved carefully in adding pressure on Iran, mindful of the loss of credibility the United States suffered over faulty intelligence on Iraq’s weapons efforts.
Now the United States faces a new set of difficult choices. Years of sanctions have hurt Iran, but the report makes clear that those sanctions have not forced it to reconsider its program. Efforts to sabotage the Iranian effort have reached back a decade, most recently with a computer worm called , which appears to have been a joint covert action by Israel and the United States. It is not mentioned in the report, but experts say it slowed Iran’s enrichment of uranium. But production rates have since recovered.
While Israel has talked about military action, both the Bush and Obama administrations have argued that an airstrike would not slow the program much, and that it would drive it further underground.
But there are many theories about whether Israel’s latest discussions of military strikes are intended to focus the West on new pressure and sanctions, or are leading up to military action.
The section of the report dealing with the credibility of the evidence described how early information it had obtained — while the report does not say so, some came from a laptop slipped out of the country by an Iranian scientist — was corroborated by later interviews with foreigners who helped Iran.
The report cited “a wide variety of independent sources,” including the agency’s own investigations. That appeared to be part of an effort to anticipate the critique that the agency was recycling information from the or Israel’s Mossad.
The report also describes how Iran has altered, every few years, the bureaucracy that runs the military side of the weapons program. It described what is essentially a nuclear version of three-card monte, in which scientists are hidden in organizations with names like “Section for Advanced Development Applications and Technologies” and at universities around Tehran. But the overall leadership of the program is the Ministry of Defense.
Much of the program was run by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who is also a professor in Tehran; he went underground after several Iranian scientists were assassinated. Iran has never allowed him, or his colleagues, to be interviewed by inspectors.
