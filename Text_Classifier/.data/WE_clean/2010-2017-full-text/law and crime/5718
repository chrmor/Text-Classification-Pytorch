Man to face court over Sian murder
A man will appear before magistrates in Swindon on Monday charged with the murder of Sian O'Callaghan.
Christopher Halliwell, 47, who was arrested by officers in a swoop on a taxi rank in Swindon on Thursday, was charged on Saturday night with killing the 22-year-old PA.
Miss O'Callaghan disappeared from the Suju nightclub in the town last Saturday. Her body was discovered close to the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire on Thursday.
On Saturday, police revealed they had removed all the remains of a second body found at a site near Eastleach, Gloucestershire. They are believed to belong to a woman aged between 23 and 30 who died between 2003 and 2005.
In a statement, Wiltshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Halliwell had been charged at 9.20pm on Saturday with Miss O'Callaghan's murder.
Simon Brenchley, district crown prosecutor for the CPS in Wiltshire, said: "I must remind the media to take care in reporting events surrounding this case. Mr Halliwell has been charged with a serious offence and is entitled to a fair trial. It is extremely important that nothing should be reported which could prejudice any trial.
"I will keep liaising closely with the police as their investigation continues."
Halliwell remains in police custody at Gablecross Police Station in Swindon.
