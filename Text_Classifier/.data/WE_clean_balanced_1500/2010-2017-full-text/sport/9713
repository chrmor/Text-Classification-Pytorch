Kentucky Derby champ, Preakness favorite Nyquist was hidden in plain sight
BALTIMORE – Hindsight is not much help with Nyquist. Before his brilliance was evident to everyone, it was not completely obvious to the experts.
The undefeated Kentucky Derby winner was the product of a first-year sire and a mare that finished her racing career overmatched in claiming races. Though Uncle Mo ultimately fathered four of the 11 colts scheduled to run in Saturday’s Preakness Stakes, his unproven stud services were available for a modest $27,500 when Nyquist was last sold last year. (His price has since risen to $75,000).
“There were a lot of unknowns,” said Bayne Welker, vice president of sales for the Fasig-Tipton thoroughbred auctions. “You were taking a shot on an early sire and a mare (Seeking Gabrielle) that was not a proven performer on the racetrack.
“... And if you look at Nyquist, he’s a plain bay horse and he doesn’t jump out at you physically. Does he have a striking presence? No. But every time he goes out there, he puts his head down and runs.”
Among the lessons retrospect teaches you about horse racing is that there are far fewer sure things than there are leaps of faith. On March 4, 2015, when the then-unnamed Nyquist sold for $400,000 at Fasig-Tipton’s 2-year-olds in training auction at Gulfstream, 11 colts and four fillies would fetch higher prices, one of them $1 million more.
Bloodstock agent Dennis O’Neill, whose brother Doug has trained Nyquist for owner J. Paul Reddam, expected the bidding on Hip No. 87 to exceed his budget. But O’Neill evidently saw something a lot of other sophisticated horsemen missed. Either that or the colt’s cloudy pedigree caused some potential buyers to back away.
“I told Paul he’d be $800 (thousand) to a million,” Dennis O’Neill recalled Friday. “I didn’t think we’d get him. Paul doesn’t normally spend that kind of money. I think I could have got Paul to about $6 or $7 (hundred thousand), that was my feeling, and then I was going to beg from that point on.”
O’Neill says now that Nyquist is the most beautiful horse he has ever bought. He knew then that Uncle Mo had been America’s 2-year-old champion before his racing career was compromised and eventually curtailed by a liver ailment. Yet if O’Neill saw more clearly than did others at the auction, he did not envision what Nyquist would become.
“The hope was that he was a good horse and he’d be a stakes horse,” O’Neill said. “But he’s gone way past our expectations.”
With eight victories in eight starts – including five Grade I stakes races at five different tracks – Nyquist has already earned $4,954,200, more than 12 times Reddam’s initial investment. He enters the Preakness as the 3-5 morning-line favorite with a reasonable chance to give racing its second straight Triple Crown winner after a 37-year drought.
That such an accomplished colt could have changed hands for $400,000 less than 15 months ago underscores the unknowable in equine evaluations. Fasig-Tipton’s Welker sees a correlation between the 2-year-old sale and the NFL draft, where “it’s not always the guy who can run the fastest.” When jockey Mario Gutierrez describes what makes Nyquist different, he speaks of qualities not always conveyed in an auction setting.
“He’s a fighter,” Gutierrez said. “I believe he has the heart of a champion. He’ll never back down from a fight. Anybody that goes at him, he’ll happily accept the challenge. He’s a horse that acts like he’s been running for a long time. That’s very special for a 3-year-old.”
While identifying promising pedigrees has become a sophisticated science, there’s still an art to interpreting limited data and a big payoff for spotting what others don’t see. Along those lines, it’s worth noting that the Kentucky Derby has been won five times since 2001 by runners from a sire’s first foal crop: Monarchos (2001); Funny Cide (2003); Street Sense (2007), Mine That Bird (2009) and now Nyquist.
“It’s nice to be right every now and then,” Dennis O’Neill said. “I’m wrong a lot more than I’m right. You have to be right or you don’t do what I do for very long.”
