Trump, Dems move closer to deal on DACA
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is moving closer to a deal with Democrats that would protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
But the parameters of any deal, including a potential pathway to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants and funding for his marquee campaign promise of a wall along the US-Mexico border are up in the air as the White House and Congress grapple with the impact of a Wednesday dinner between Trump and Democratic leaders.
The bombshell developments, which were first announced by Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi and reiterated by Trump himself Thursday morning, were met with immediate outrage from conservatives and put pressure on the President's Republican allies in Congress.
A deal would be the second major Trump-Pelosi-Schumer pact this month, following the agreement on the debt ceiling and government spending.
Trump said House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are "very much on board" with plans to make the DACA program -- which protected nearly 800,000 individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation -- permanent.
The President also has indicated that funding for the wall -- a signature campaign promise -- would be part of an agreement, but it is unclear when that would happen or if it would be a prerequisite for a DACA deal.
"We are not looking at citizenship. We are not looking at amnesty," Trump said. "We are looking at allowing people to stay here. We are working with everybody."
The two Democratic leaders announced that following a dinner at the White House, they had "agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that's acceptable to both sides."
"What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security, with a mutual goal of finalizing all details as soon as possible," the statement said. "While both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this agreement, the President made clear he intends to pursue it at a later time, and we made clear we would continue to oppose it."
"We're right now renovating large sections of wall," he said. "Making it brand new. We're doing a lot of renovations we're building four different samples of the wall to see which one we're going to choose. The wall is going to be built -- it will be funded a little bit later."
If a deal on some immigration and border issues happens, it would be the second major agreement between Trump, Schumer and Pelosi this month following their pact last week to raise the debt ceiling and extend government funding into December that left the GOP and some of Trump's closest allies flabbergasted.
Making a deal that finds a way to keep the individuals who benefit under DACA in the United States shows the challenge of striking bipartisan deals in Washington, and no agreement will move forward in Congress unless Ryan and McConnell agree on it.
Congressional Republican leaders were absent from Wednesday's dinner, which featured Chinese food and chocolate pie for dessert, sources said, and it was not immediately clear how they would handle such legislation on Capitol Hill.
"It's the beginning of a listening that the President asked us to do," McCarthy said. "We've got a broken immigration system we've got to fix. It was the beginning of a discussion where we were listening to concerns."
There was significant trepidation among senior GOP aides before Wednesday night's dinner that Trump would make concessions to Democrats on DACA. Behind the scenes, Republican leadership has been crafting a plan and process to get address the issue while also getting the conference comfortable with the extent of the border security money and resources they planned on securing for any deal.
