Nigeria violence: Bomb at fish market kills at least 20
At least 20 people have been killed after female suicide bombers attacked a fish market in Nigeria's north-eastern city of Maiduguri, eyewitnesses have told the BBC.
The attackers disguised themselves as beggars to try to enter the market, eyewitnesses say.
One woman blew herself up inside the market, while another fled, detonating her vest nearby, with no casualties.
Islamist militant group Boko Haram has not commented on the attack.
The group will be the key suspect, as it is known for carrying out suicide bomb attacks in the city.
Maiduguri is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the Nigerian military has recently begun moving its headquarters from the capital Abuja to the strategic north-eastern city.
