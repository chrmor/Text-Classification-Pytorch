Palestinian dies of tear gas inhalation, 40 others wounded in clashes at Qalandiya
RAMALLAH (Ma'an) -- A Palestinian man was pronounced dead on Friday after suffering from excessive tear gas inhalation when Israeli forces heavily fired tear gas at crowds, reportedly wounding some 40 others, as Palestinians attempted to cross the Qalandiya checkpoint from Ramallah in the central occupied West Bank into occupied East Jerusalem to attend prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
The man, identified by medical sources as Muhammad Mustafa Habash, 63, from the Asira al-Shamaliya village in the northern occupied West Bank district of Nablus, was one of at least 40 Palestinians who suffered from severe tear gas inhalation during clashes that broke out at the Qalandiya checkpoint.
Witnesses told Maâ€™an that Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics were prevented by Israeli forces from treating the man at the start of the incident. However, they eventually were able to reach him.
A paramedic gave the man CPR before he was transported to the Ramallah Governmental Hospital for treatment and put in intensive care.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health later pronounced the man dead.
