12 areas declared natural disaster zones
Twelve areas around Sydney and Newcastle have been declared natural disaster zones after the devastating storms and floods that hit the NSW coast on Monday.
Maitland, where at least one person was killed on Wednesday when their car was swept away, and Dungog, where three elderly people were killed in flash flooding on Tuesday, are among 12 local council areas declared natural disaster zones on Wednesday night by Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan and NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott.
Cessnock, Gosford, Great Lakes, Lake Macquarie, Newcastle, Pittwater, Port Stephens, Singleton, Warringah and Wyong also qualify for disaster assistance.
People affected by the storms and floods can access personal hardship assistance payments from Wednesday, Mr Elliott said.
