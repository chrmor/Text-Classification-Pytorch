Indian man 'set on fire' in Melbourne attack
An Indian man is in a serious condition in hospital after he was allegedly attacked by four men and set on fire in Melbourneâ€™s north-west overnight.
The 29-year-old was taken to hospital with burns to 15 per cent of his body after the attack shortly before 2am in Essendon.
"I believe there's no reason at this stage to consider this in any way racially motivated," Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Neil Smyth told reporters on Saturday.
"The circumstances of parking a car randomly on a side street and just some people approaching him are a bit strange and it's highly unlikely, therefore, to be a targeted attack on any individual."
Police were told the man had dropped his wife at home and gone to park his car after a dinner party when he was set upon in Grice Crescent.
Police allege that as the man was getting out of the car, four men attacked him, pushing him back against the vehicle and pouring an unknown fluid on him.
