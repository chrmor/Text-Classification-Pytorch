Rupert Murdoch foam pie: 'Jonnie Marbles' admits charge
A protester has admitted throwing a shaving foam pie at Rupert Murdoch as he gave evidence to a committee of MPs.
The News Corporation chairman was targeted as he answered questions about the phone-hacking scandal last week.
His wife tackled Jonathan May-Bowles who rushed from the public gallery.
May-Bowles, 26, of Edinburgh Gardens, Windsor, Berkshire, admitted assault and causing harassment, alarm or distress, when he appeared before City of Westminster Magistrates' Court.
May-Bowles, who calls himself Jonnie Marbles, is due to be sentenced on 2 August.
After requesting the date be moved to accommodate a pre-booked family holiday, May-Bowles' solicitor was told an arrest warrant would be issued if he failed to turn up.
District Judge Daphne Wickham said: "He is on bail for a serious offence which carries a risk of imprisonment.
"He should have thought about this on 19 July when he committed these offences."
Leaving the court the part-time stand-up comic said: "I would just like to say this has been the most humble day of my life."
This echoed the words of Rupert Murdoch on the day he was attacked by May-Bowles.
Two hours into the hearing on 20 July, May-Bowles rushed forward from the public gallery with a paper plate filled with foam.
He was tackled by a group of people including Mr Murdoch's wife Wendi Deng who leapt up to defend her 80-year-old husband and appeared to slap May-Bowles on the head.
The shaving foam hit Mr Murdoch's suit jacket and he later resumed the session in his shirt and tie.
Seconds later, Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee and was overseeing proceedings, suspended the session.
