The Portuguese superstar scored a tournament single campaign record of 17 goals which included a penalty in the final against bitter city rivals Atletico.
'I have to say thank you to my team-mates as without them my individual aren't possible,' Ronaldo said upon collecting the award.
'I would like to also thank my family, my coaches and the journalists who voted for me.
'I'm really happy, I've never won this award so I'm going to get my brother to place this in my museum.'
The 29-year-old's impressive club form stretched to 51 goals and 15 assists as Real also sealed a Copa del Rey triumph.
Ronaldo beat Bayern Munich duo Neuer and Robben to the prize - who both enjoyed a succesful season with their club.
The German giants swept the board domestically winning the league and cup double.
Neuer's domestic form carried over to the international level too with his performances in Brazil helping Germany lift a fourth World Cup.
