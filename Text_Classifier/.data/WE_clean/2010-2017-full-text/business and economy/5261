Australia expects less than 1,000 companies to pay carbon tax
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian plans to impose a set price on carbon emissions would affect fewer than 1,000 companies, Climate Change Minister Greg Combet said on Monday.
Combet also said he expected Australiaâ€™s emissions trading scheme would be internationally compatible once the scheme had passed beyond its fixed price period, which will run three to five years from July 2012.
