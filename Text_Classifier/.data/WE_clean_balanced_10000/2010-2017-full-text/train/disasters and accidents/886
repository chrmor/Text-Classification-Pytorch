Dozens more miners rescued from China mine; 8 killed
Rescuers pulled out the last 45 workers trapped following a mine explosion that killed eight others in central China, state media reported Saturday.
Seventy-five miners were working in the shaft at the time of the blast Thursday night, according to the Xinhua news agency. A total of 67 miners were rescued.
The mine in Sanmenxia city belongs to a state-owned coal company in Henan province.
China, a large producer and consumer of coal, has one of the world's deadliest records for miners.
News of the injury and deaths of miners appear regularly in state media, with safety conditions, a lack of training and the flouting of laws contributing to the high number of deaths.
One of China's most dangerous year on record was 2002, with 6,995 deaths.
