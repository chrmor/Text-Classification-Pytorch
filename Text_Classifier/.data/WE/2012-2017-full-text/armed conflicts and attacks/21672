Syria Gas Attack Reportedly Kills Dozens in Idlib Province
The Syrian government denied any involvement and said it was complying with the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such instruments of war, according to SANA, the Syrian state-run news agency. Instead, the government blamed "armed terrorist organizations" for the attack.
"The Syrian Arab republic stresses that all those fabricated allegations will not prevent it from continuing its war on terrorism ... and from working for a political solution to the crisis in Syria," SANA reported.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which monitors the chemical weapons treaty, said it had set up a fact-finding mission to get to the bottom of Tuesday's attack.
The pro-opposition Idlib Media Center posted pictures to Facebook showing children who appeared to be either dead or incapacitated, and the White Helmets, a volunteer group, shared images of its members spraying children with a hose.
NBC News has not verified the photos, but government leaders, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said the attack clearly used banned chemical weapons.
Tillerson noted that the attack was the third time such weapons are alleged to have been used this month, charging: "It is clear that this is how Bashar al-Assad operates: with brutal, unabashed barbarism.
