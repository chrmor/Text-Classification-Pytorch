Cuba to free 2 prisoners, Catholic church says
The archbishopric of Havana says that the Cuban government is soon to release two prisoners. Spokesman Orlando Marquez says Miguel Angel Vidal Guadarrama and Hector Larroque Rego are to be freed "shortly" and will be sent to Spain. The two men are not on a list of 52 dissidents whom Cuba has pledged to release under a deal with the church. Jailed in a 2003 crackdown, all 52 were supposed to be freed by early November, but 11 remain in jail. It wasn't clear whether they were required to move to Spain in exchange for their release, but all but one of the 41 freed so far are now living there. Those still behind bars say they want to remain in Cuba. The announcement came in a statement Thursday.
