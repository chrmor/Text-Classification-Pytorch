Cristiano Ronaldo breaks La Liga scoring record
Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo broke the Primera Division record for goals in a single season after netting his 39th and 40th of the campaign in an 8-1 thrashing of Almeria.
Ronaldo needed just five minutes of Madrid's final game of the season against already-relegated Almeria to seal his place in the record books.
Xabi Alonso's free-kick to the far post was headed back across goal by Sergio Ramos and the unmarked Ronaldo was on hand to poke in the opening goal of the game.
That strike saw Ronaldo move one clear of the previous all-time record, which he jointly held with Madrid's Hugo Sanchez, from the 1989-90 season, and the legendary Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra, who achieved the feat during the 1959-60 campaign.
Ronaldo, who had scored nine goals in his previous three games heading into Saturday's fixture, then added a second and has now netted 53 in all competitions for Madrid this season.
