Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox withdraws bid to acquire Time Warner Inc
Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has withdrawn its bid to acquire multinational media group Time Warner Inc.
In a statement, chief executive Rupert Murdoch said the Time Warner board and managers "refused to engage" with his company's offer.
"Additionally, the reaction in our share price since our proposal was made undervalues our stock and makes the transaction unattractive to Fox shareholders," the statement said.
"These factors, coupled with our commitment to be both disciplined in our approach to the combination and focused on delivering value for the Fox shareholders, has led us to withdraw our offer."
Instead, 21st Century Fox says it is initiating a $6 billion share buyback program over the next year.
Fox shares rose sharply in after-hours trading, while shares of Time Warner fell more than 10 per cent.
Time Warner owns the Warner Bros movie studios as well as popular cable channels CNN and HBO.
Fox had indicated that it would sell CNN if the takeover was successful to clear any regulatory hurdles.
Mr Murdoch's initial cash-and-stock bid earlier this year was worth about $US80 billion, or $85 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
The offer, which was first reported by The New York Times, consisted of 60 per cent in stock and the rest in cash.
The company 21st Century Fox owns cable news channel Fox News as well as movie studio 20th Century Fox.
