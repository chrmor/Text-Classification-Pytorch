Cook Islands to hold polls
People in the Pacific island nation of Cook Islands will go to polls on Thursday (Cook Islands local time Wednesday), and at least 98 percent of 10,000 registered eligible voters are expected to cast a vote.Voters will also be able to decide whether they want to see a reduction of the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) in the 24- seat Parliament in a national referendum.The two major parties are the Cook Islands Party and the Democratic Party, but a record number of 16 independents are also contesting the 24 seats in the Pacific nation's parliament.That has led to speculation the outcome will result in the formation of a coalition government between successful Independents and one of the major parties, Radio New Zealand International reported.A team of observers representing the Pacific Islands Forum arrived in the Cook Islands on Tuesday to observe the elections.
