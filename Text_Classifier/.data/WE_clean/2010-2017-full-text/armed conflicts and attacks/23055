Islamic State is prime suspect in Turkey bombing
ISTANBUL, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Islamic State is the focus of investigations into a twin suicide bombing that killed at least 97 people in the Turkish capital Ankara, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Monday.
Speaking on Turkish broadcaster NTV in a live interview, Davutoglu said Saturday's attack was an attempt to influence the outcome of a parliamentary election due on Nov. 1 and that necessary steps would be taken if security failures were found to have contributed to the bombing.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which said it was targeted in the attack, has put the death toll at 128. Davutoglu's office has said 97 people were killed.
