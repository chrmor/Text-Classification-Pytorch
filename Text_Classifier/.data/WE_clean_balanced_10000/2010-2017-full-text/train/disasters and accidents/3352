India building collapse rescue ends with 61 dead
The rescue operation at an 11-storey building that collapsed in the Indian city of Chennai has been called off, with the final death toll put at 61.
Rescuers saved 27 people, including eight women, from the rubble of the under construction building that toppled in heavy rain late on Saturday.
The government has ordered an investigation into the incident.
India has seen frequent building collapses, many blamed on lax safety and substandard construction materials.
At least six people, including construction company officials, have been arrested in connection with the collapse in Chennai (Madras), the capital of Tamil Nadu.
Senior Chennai public health official K Kulandaisamy said 61 people, including 20 women, had died in the incident.
The cause of the latest collapse is still under investigation, officials say.
