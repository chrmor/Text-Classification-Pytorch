Much of the tear gas that billowed through Bahrain's streets Monday (and throughout the Arab Spring) was made by a Pennsylvania-based company called Combined Systems, so to mark the anniversary of protests in Bahrain, Anonymous took Combined Systems' website offline and dumped its employee and client data on the Web.
The Combined Systems website was unresponsive on Tuesday morning, as were the websites for surveillance hardware manufacturer Sur-Tec, Thompson Handcuffs, and weapons maker Penn Arms, all of which Anonymous claimed credit for knocking offline. The loose-knit hacking collective promised more such attacks for Valentine's Day, tweeting: "Stay tuned for more Valentine's Day Hacks. Have you enjoyed the show so far?"
