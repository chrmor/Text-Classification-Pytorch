East Liberty Target Stabbing Spree Leaves 6 Injured; Suspect In Custody (VIDEO)
At least six people have been injured by a man with a long knife who allegedly stabbed at least four of his victims at a Target in East Liberty, Pa.
The incident started around 5:30 p.m. when the man, whose name has not been released, started swinging a long knife outside the store, according to eyewitness Tyrique Walker.
“I saw this guy walk past a group of older gentlemen swinging a knife,” Walker told WPXI-TV. “I walked up to the Target and saw him go inside. So I went up to a security guard and told them a guy who stabbed someone outside was in the store.”
Eyewitnesses told authorities the suspect used a long kitchen knifeto stab people on the second floor of the store and that the stabbings appeared to be random, KDKA-TV reported.
Another eyewitness told WTAE-TV that the suspect chased people through the aisles. The witness tried to leave until he heard a woman screaming.
"I went back up the top of the steps, and he had this girl by the top of her hair. He just kept screaming, 'I'll stab her again,'" the eyewitness told the station. "He kept stabbing her. Me and like four or five other guys, ran and tackled him."
Some of the people in the store reportedly used a baseball bat to get the man down to the ground and away from people in the store.
One 16-year-old suffered the most serious wounds and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. A police officer was also treated for pepper spray exposure, but the rest of the injuries were classified as moderate to minor, TribLive.com reported.
