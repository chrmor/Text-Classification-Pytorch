Suicide Bombers Strike Chad’s Capital
DAKAR, Senegal — Suicide bombers struck for the first time in the capital of Chad on Monday morning, apparently in retaliation for the leading role the country has played in a regional war against the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, officials said.
Bombs were detonated at Police Headquarters in the heart of the capital, Ndjamena, and at the police training academy. Twenty-three people were killed, in addition to the four attackers, and 101 people were wounded, according to a statement from the president’s office. Images on state television showed the bloodied, uniformed bodies of police cadets scattered on the floor of the police academy.
No claim of responsibility had been made by Monday afternoon, but the statement from the president’s office said directly that Boko Haram was to blame.
The Chadian government said the suicide bombers blew themselves up around 9 a.m. but gave few other details.
