More than 500 migrants land in Malta from Libya
VALLETTA, March 28 (Reuters) - A group of 515 Somali and Eritrean migrants landed in Malta on Monday having travelled from Libya, the Maltese armed forces said.
The migrants were the first to arrive at the Mediterranean island in more than a year and the biggest group in more than 10 years.
The migrants arrived in two boats and were escorted to shore by Maltese patrol boats.
Many were women and children and one man was in a wheelchair. They said they had spent two nights and three days at sea. (Reporting by Chris Scicluna; Editing by Louise Ireland)
