KATHMANDU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake in Nepal climbed to 6,624 and a total of 14,025 others were injured, the police said on Saturday.
Efforts were ongoing to retrieve bodies from the rubble, though hopes have faded for finding more survivors a week after the 7.9- magnitude quake hit the Himalayan country.
Meanwhile, the EU ambassador said up to 1,000 people from the European Union, mostly tourists and trekkers, were still unaccounted for in Nepal.
