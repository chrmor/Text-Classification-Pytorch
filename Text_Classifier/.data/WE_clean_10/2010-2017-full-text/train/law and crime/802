Knicks' Jason Kidd arrested on DWI charges
Jason Kidd made surprising headlines with his decision to join the New York Knicks as a free agent.
Now he's making surprising headlines for doing the wrong things off the court.
The 10-time All-Star point guard, who on Thursday signed his three-year, $9.5 million contract with the Knicks, was arrested early Sunday for alleged drunken driving, according to police in Southampton Town (N.Y.).
Kidd, 39, was arraigned on a misdemeanor DWI charge and released.
Police said Kidd's 2010 Cadillac Escalade struck a telephone pole and went into the woods near the intersection of Cobb Road and Little Cobb Road in Water Mill. Kidd's house in the Hamptons was nearby. Kidd was the lone passenger in the accident, which reportedly took place around 2 a.m.
Kidd was transported to the Southampton Hospital for treatment of minor injuries before dealing with the police.
Kidd's attorney, Eddie Burke Jr., did not elaborate on the incident released Sunday evening. "Jason was involved in a single vehicle accident on his way back home from a charity function last night," Bruke said. "He suffered minor injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. Jaosn has pleaded not guilty to a DWI charge and awaits further court proceedings." TMZ reported that Kidd was carried out of the club he was partying at before he crashed because he was so intoxicated. Kidd has faced trouble with the law before. He was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty for a domestic violence charge in January of 2001.
