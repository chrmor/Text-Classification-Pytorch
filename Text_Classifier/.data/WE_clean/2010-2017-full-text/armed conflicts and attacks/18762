Pro-Russia Rebels Defiant as Ukraine Military Advances Toward Donetsk
Leaders of the pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine vowed in a rare joint appearance Thursday to turn their biggest remaining stronghold into a final battleground as government forces edged closer.
Ukrainian officials said they had regained control of the rebel-held town of Siversk, and were moving to consolidate their position by funneling aid into recaptured areas and repairing damaged infrastructure there.
