Hurricane Carlos moves west, tracking Mexican Pacific coast
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Carlos threatened Mexico's southwest with heavy rain on Monday as it tracked the Pacific coastline, moving northwest toward the tourist resort of Puerto Vallarta, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
Carlos was 85 miles (137 km) south of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, blowing maximum sustained winds of about 75 miles per hour (121 kph) with higher gusts, and moving west-northwest at around 6 mph (10 kph), the Miami-based NHC said.
Carlos returned to category 1 hurricane status on Monday after slightly losing strength at the weekend.
NHC projections showed Carlos could end up near Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco state by late Wednesday, though by then it is predicted to have weakened again.
Rain from Carlos is expected to fall in the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit, with 15 inches (38 cm) possible in some areas through Wednesday, the NHC said.
A hurricane watch was in effect from Punta San Telmo to Playa Perula. There is also a tropical storm warning between Punta San Telmo and the port of Lazaro Cardenas.
