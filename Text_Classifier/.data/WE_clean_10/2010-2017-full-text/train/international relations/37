Americans supported pragmatic Gillard
US DIPLOMATS closely followed the rise of Julia Gillard, applauded her shedding of Labor Left allegiances and confidently predicted that she would be the next prime minister more than eight months before she deposed Kevin Rudd.
Secret US embassy cables reveal that US diplomats in Canberra paid close attention to Ms Gillard, identifying her at an early stage as the ''rising star'' of the Rudd government, rapidly outshining the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and other ministers.
Although an early report by the then ambassador, Robert McCallum, said Ms Gillard was ''a loyal and competent deputy'', US diplomats had no doubt about her ambitions and as early as June 2008 declared her the ''front-runner'' to replace Mr Rudd.
US diplomats were anxious to establish Ms Gillard's attitudes towards the US alliance and other key foreign policy issues, especially on Israel and Palestine. They were hampered by the fact that the embassy had relatively little contact with her during Labor's years in opposition.
Numerous Labor figures were drawn into conversation about Ms Gillard with ''many key ALP insiders'' quickly telling embassy officers that her past membership of the Victorian Socialist Left faction meant little and that she was ''at heart a pragmatist''.
