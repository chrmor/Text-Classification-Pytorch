Fire Kills at Least 30 at Refugee Camp in Thailand
BANGKOK â€” A fire at a refugee camp in Thailand killed at least 30 people on Friday, a Thai firefighter said.
The fire destroyed 100 shelters in the Mae Surin refugee camp, which is in the northern Thai province of Mae Hong Son and is for ethnic Karen refugees from neighboring Myanmar who fled fighting between guerrillas and government forces. About 3,300 refugees live at the camp, according to The Associated Press.
The firefighter, Patipat Saiprasert, said by telephone that the shelters were built from bamboo and banana leaves and that the camp lacked firefighting equipment.
The cause of the blaze was still under investigation, but Mr. Patipat said the fire could have spread from nearby fields, where farmers burn the remnants of their crops before a new planting season. The burning of fields has caused a blanket of noxious smoke haze across Mae Hong Son Province in recent days.
