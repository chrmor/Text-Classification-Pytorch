BEIJING (AP) — A state-run local news website says that a chemical factory has exploded in eastern China, killing one person just three weeks after massive chemical warehouse explosions in the country exposed lax enforcement of safety regulations.
The Dongying News website — run by the Dongying city government — says the factory in Lijin county exploded at 11.22pm Monday and the fire was brought under control about five hours later.
Calls to the Lijin county propaganda department were hung up. People answering calls to the police and fire offices said they had no information.
Dongying News said the cause was under investigation.
The area is 300 kilometers (190 miles) away from Tianjin, where blasts on Aug. 12 at warehouses storing hazardous chemicals killed at least 158 people.
