A volcano in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo erupted on Saturday morning, raising concerns for villages nearby as well as the Virunga national park.
Mount Nyamulagira is one of Africa's most active volcanoes.
Nobody has so far been injured by the eruption, and park officials with UN support are monitoring the situation.
When neighbouring volcano Nyiragongo, which lies 12km away, erupted in 2002, thousands of homes were destroyed and dozens killed by lava flows.
