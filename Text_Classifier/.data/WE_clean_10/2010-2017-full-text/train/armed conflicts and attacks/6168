Isis buries dozens of jihadists alive as punishment for escaping battlefront near Kirkuk
YEREVAN, MAY 11, ARMENPRESS. The Islamic State (Isis) has reportedly executed more than three dozen of its jihadists after they decided not to fight and escaped during a battle against Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Local news sources claim that 35 to 45 militants were buried alive as punishment for their cowardice in the face of conflict, reports The International Business Times.
An unnamed provincial source told Ahlul Bayt News Agency (ABNA) that the terrorists buried 35 fellow extremists alive on the outskirts of Qayyarah after they were accused of running away from the attack against pro-government Iraqi forces in Bashir, a village south of the Iraqi city of Kirkuk.
