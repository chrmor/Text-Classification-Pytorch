European Union Plans Emergency Aid to Help Trapped Refugees
BRUSSELS — For the first time in its history, the European Union on Wednesday announced plans for an emergency aid package to alleviate large-scale suffering inside its borders, where tens of thousands of migrants are trapped in Greece as they seek asylum in northern Europe.
“The crowded conditions are leading to shortages of food, shelter, water and sanitation,” Adrian Edwards, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency said in a statement this week. “Tensions have been building, fueling violence and playing into the hands of people smugglers.”
About 9,000 asylum seekers are stuck along the Greek-Macedonian border, according to monitoring groups. Migrants who have made it to Athens are crowded into camps and refugee centers that are either full or nearly so.
The spending proposal — 700 million euros, or about $760 million, which the bloc’s member governments have yet to approve — is intended to help those migrants trapped in Greece and, if needed, in other countries on the front lines of the migration crisis, such as Bulgaria and Italy.
