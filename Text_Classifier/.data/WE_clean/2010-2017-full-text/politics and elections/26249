Iran holds run-off parliamentary election
ANKARA, April 29 (Reuters) - Iranians started voting on Friday for a second round of parliamentary elections for 68 seats of the 290-seat assembly, state TV reported.
"The voters will elect 68 lawmakers in constituencies that candidates failed to get 25 percent of votes cast in the first round of the election," said Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, state TV reported.
President Hassan Rouhani's moderate and centrist allies made major gains in the parliamentary election held in February 26, but failed to win a majority. The current parliament is dominated by hardliners. (Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by SImon Cameron-Moore)
