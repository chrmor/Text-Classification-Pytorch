The Immigration Department says Indonesian crewmen being held at the Darwin immigration detention centre for alleged people smuggling sparked a protest this morning.
About a dozen men climbed onto the top of the centre armed with long sticks, banging on the roof and making noise.
At one stage thick, black smoke was billowing from the centre, and police and fire crews attended the scene.
Some of the men on roof wore hoods, their faces were partially covered by masks and others had light paint smeared on their faces.
They appeared to be manning the gutter to stop others climbing up to them, and one threw a chair off the roof with force.
The men are no longer on the roof and the Immigration Department says the incident is under control.
Department spokesman Sandi Logan says two men climbed a tree before dawn and would not come down.
He says other Indonesian crew joined the pair and lit a fire in the yard using rubbish and a mattress.
He says the fire has been put out.
"At some stage refuse and rubbish and a mattress was thrown into a pile and lit," he said.
"As a consequence a fire had to then be extinguished as it burned out in the open yard."
Mr Logan says the protest involved crewmen who were upset about being detained while their cases were processed.
He would not say how many people were involved.
There are about 500 people in the centre, including 151 Indonesian crew.
