Iraqi army announces recapture of east Mosul
The Iraqi army has announced the "liberation" of east Mosul, following the collapse of Islamic State defences on the left bank of the Tigris River. 
IsolatedIslamic State fighters reportedly holding out in a few north-eastern districtswould be “cleaned up,” said Brigadier General Sami Al Aradi of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces. “After that we will move on to west Mosul.”
The announcement comes three months after Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) began the battle to retake the city, which has been under the control of militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) for more than two-and-a-half years. The speed of the ISF advance increased markedly following a renewed push since Dec 29.
