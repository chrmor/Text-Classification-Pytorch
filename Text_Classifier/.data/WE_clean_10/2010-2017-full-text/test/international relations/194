Bolivia recognizes Palestinian state
: Bolivia announces Friday that it is officially and fully recognizing the Palestinian state in line with the 1967 borders, according to a report by Palestinian news agency Ma’an.
Earlier, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay said they recognize the Palestinian state.
According to the report, the Bolivian Foreign Ministry announced that President Evo Morales made the declaration during a conference in Brazil attended by other Latin Americans leaders.
“Bolivia recognizes a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders,” Morales was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, officials at the Palestinian Authority’s Foreign Ministry said they are continuing their efforts to elicit further recognition of their state by more Latin American countries.
President Mahmoud Abbas lauded the move, expressed his gratitude to Bolivia for its support, and praised the ties between the PA and the South American state. Official sources said the Bolivian president phoned Abbas three days before making the official declarations
Israel’s foreign Ministry condemned the Bolivian move, noting the step makes no contribution to peace. Similar condemnations were issued after the other South American states made their declarations.
Bolivia severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in January 2009 during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza and is considered a harsh critic of Israel’s policy.
