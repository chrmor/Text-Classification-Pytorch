Bahrain grand prix protests – Sunday 22 April
9.51am: Good morning. Welcome to Middle East live. The focus today is on Bahrain where the Formula One grand prix is going ahead despite a growing international outcry.
• The grand prix is set to go ahead amid intensifired criticism of the staging of the race in the Gulf state following the discovery of the body of a protester allegedly abducted from a village by security forces. According to the opposition party Wefaq, the body of 36-year-old Salah Abbas Habib Musa, a father of five, was found on a rooftop in the Shia village of Shakhoura the day before the race. Pictures of Habib's body shown on Bahraini television appeared different to a long-lens shot of his body taken from a neighbouring roof just after the body's discovery (warning: graphic), suggesting that sticks had been placed around his body and a catapult placed in his hand.
• Nabeel Rajab, one of the country's leading opposition activists, has accused the Bahraini government of holding back Habib's body to prevent his funeral coinciding with the grand prix.
• Black smoke from burning tyres has been wafting over Budaiya this morning, ahead of the race, which is due to begin at 1pm BST. Budaiya, outside the capital of Manama, was the scene of mass protests on Friday.
• Fahad al Binali, spokesman for the Bahrain information affairs authority, said measures were in place to prevent any disruption to the event. He told the BBC: "Guaranteeing is difficult, but we have the best measures in place. I'm very confident and assure everybody about safety."
• Syrian troops stormed and shelled districts in a suburb of Damascus today, activists told AP, a day after the security council voted to expand the number of UN truce monitors to 300 members in hopes of salvaging an international peace plan marred by continued fighting between the military and opposition rebels.
10.01am: The Guardian's Richard Williams writes that the furore surrounding today's race is a result of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone's "habit of taking the money and asking no questions".
10.13am: The Press Association's Formula One journalist provides some sense of the extent of the security operation today - he says he has counted 86 police cars on their way to race.

10.53am: A focus for recent protests in Bahrain has been the continued detention of leading opposition activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja (pictured below), who has been on hunger strike for 74 days.

Khawaja was sentenced to life-imprisoment in June last year for his part in the uprising against the western-backed Sunni monarchy, on charges opposition activists and human rights groups say were trumped up.
The interior ministry has moved to dispel fears about Khawaja's health today and said the Danish ambassador would be meeting the activist.
11.00am: Mohamed, tweeting under the handle @almakna, has posted a picture of black smoke rising (as reported seperately by Reuters), taken by @14Feb which he says is near the hotel Formula One drivers are staying in.

12.46pm: @al9aaaad8 claims that the road to the race track is being blocked by protesters.
The same Tweeter claims that an Indian man has been killed by teargas canisters thrown into his house by "mercenaries". The Guardian cannot independently verify this report. Opposition activists claim that a large number of the deaths since the start of the uprising have been as a result of teargas.
12.49pm: Whether it is a result of protests or not, attendance at the grand prix appears thin.

• The controversial Formula One grand prix passed without incident but a group of women reportedly held a protest inside the Bahrain International Circuit.

Attendance at the race was low according to people at the circuit
• Protests have also been reported outside the circuit, including in Abu Saiba, Bilad al-Qadim, Jidhafs and Sitra. Pictures were posted online purportedly showing use of teargas against protesters and armoured cars on the streets.
• The Sunday Telegraph's chief foreign correspondent, Colin Freeman and his fixer, Mohammed Hasan, have been taken to a police station in Bahrain.

• Ala'a Shehabi, an activist who met Bernie Ecclestone earlier this year to try to persuade him to call off the Bahrain GP, said she in a Tweet that she has been arrested.
• Syrian soldiers stormed the Damascus suburb of Douma, and rebels bombed a military convoy in Aleppo, in the north of the country, as international mediator Kofi Annan urged both sides to work with an expanding team of UN ceasefire monitors. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces killed at least 12 people on Sunday, six of them in Homs province. The others were killed when security forces opened fire in the northern province of Idlib and when soldiers backed by tanks charged into Douma, it said. At least four soldiers were killed when a bomb hit an armoured personnel carrier outside Douma, it added.

• Ceasefire monitors visited Rastan, a rebel-held town south of Hama, according to activists. An amateur video posted online showed two white UN vehicles driving in Rastan accompanied by a red pick up truck with the words "Free Army" written on it. Other videos showed two UN monitors wearing blue helmets and body armor touring Rastan along with officers from the rebel Free Syrian Army who point to damaged buildings and a large crowd of people shouting "Bye Bye Bashar!" and "The people want to topple the regime." In Hama, activists said soldiers opened fire to prevent a crowd from meeting the observers in the city's main square. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the city.
7.29pm: Good evening. This is Ben Quinntaking over the blog now.
Some news first from Egypt, where the country's former foreign minister, who is also a leading contender for the presidency, has said he would give the military a voice in key policies via a national security council.
The comments by Amr Moussa, reports the Associated Press news agency, is a move to reassure ruling generals about their status after a power transfer.
Moussa, a self-described liberal nationalist whose main election rivals are Islamists, also said Egypt needed a president with lobbying skills to work effectively with the Islamist-dominated parliament and other institutions after decades of autocratic government.
Egypt's presidential vote that starts on May 23-24 will mark the final stage of a transition to civilian rule from generals who took charge after Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year.

7.55pm: The result today on the Grand Prix track is far from the minds of many following events in Bahrain but, for the record, it was won by Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel.
Reuters reports that the race passed off in front of half-empty stands and that oficials put spectator numbers at 28,000 in a circuit that can hold 45,000.
Vettel said shortly after arrival on Thursday that he thought much of what was being reported was hype and wanted to focus on "stuff that really matters - tyre temperatures, cars".
After the race, he appeared relieved. "It was a difficult race, extremely tough," said the 24-year-old German, who closed his eyes and took a deep breath as he stood on the podium.
7.59pm: Tough security enabled today's race in Bahrain to go ahead in Manama, but have opponents claimed moral victory, reports the Guardian's Middle East editor, Ian Black:
8.05pm: A Channel 4 News spokesman has told the Press Association: "We can confirm that our foreign affairs correspondent Jonathan Miller and his team have been arrested whilst reporting for the programme from a village in Bahrain."
"Our primary concern is for the safety of the team, and we are working with the appropriate authorities to secure a swift release."
"We are also working hard to establish the whereabouts of the driver who was assaulted and separated from the group."
8.07pm: The US ambassador to Yemen has said that a recent military shake-up has improved the fight against al-Qaida, which has taken advantage of internal turmoil to overrun parts of the country's south.
Ambassador Gerald Feierstein also told reporters in the capital, Sanaa, that Washington is concerned about Yemeni officials who resist reforms ordered by the new president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. He replaced longtime ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh after a year of demonstrations and unrest.
8.14pm: Now the race has finished, Formula One and Bahrain must start to recover from what has been a PR disaster, Paul Weaver, Formula One correspondent for the Guardian.
8.38pm: Here is a link to an interview Channel 4 News' Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Jonathan Miller, gave to Channel 4 News earlier this evening after he and his crew were arrested.
Speaking from a police landrover as they made their way to a police station, Miller said they had been filming in a shia village earlier today, where residents have been demonstrating on a daily basis.
Miller said his crew had been operating without accreditation, adding: "We came under the rader and had been filming discreetly."
"Basically we had been lucky until then we were actually heading back to where we are staying to edit the piece we had collated for tonight, which was quite strong actually."
The authorities had been very unpleasant towards the crew and he was particularly worried for their Bahraini driver, who he had hired to drive them around and who had willingly taken up the job. The record of the Bahraini police gave his crew major cause for concern about the fate that might now await their driver.
"Unfortunately this country does not invite very many journalists in to cover things here," he added.
"They want coverage of the Grand Prix and not much else, Sports journalists, you may have noticed, from other channels have ended up doing some of the political reporting."
9.55pm: Bahrain's Foreign Minister, Khalid Alkhalifa, has been tweeting about the arrest of the Channel 4 crew:
10.20pm: Britain's Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has also used twitter to react to the arrest of the Channel 4 crew:
