The Latest: McCrory still resists calls
RALEIGH (AP) -- The Latest on the counting of ballots in the close North Carolina governor's race (all times local):
Republican incumbent Pat McCrory keeps rejecting calls by Democrats to concede in the close race for North Carolina governor even as Roy Cooper's lead in unofficial results has nearly doubled since election night.
McCrory told The Associated Press on Wednesday in Greenville that he's in what might be the state's closest gubernatorial election ever. He says he's "going to respect the process and respect the results" and expects others to do the same.
He says the process could include recounting more than 90,000 Durham County ballots. The State Board of Elections takes up later Wednesday a hand-recount requested by a Republican attorney. The Durham elections board already rejected that request, but McCrory's campaign emailed supporters urging them to contact the board and say they want the recount.
The latest numbers show Cooper leading by 9,800 ballots. McCrory can get a statewide recount if the lead is 10,000 votes or less.
Possibly one of Republican Pat McCrory's last hopes to catch up to Democrat Roy Cooper in the governor's race is going before the North Carolina State Board of Elections.
The board scheduled Wednesday to hear the appeal of a Republican attorney who wants more than 90,000 Durham County votes recounted by hand because of alleged irregularities in the election night count. The Durham board unanimously rejected the request of Tom Stark two weeks ago, saying there was no evidence the tallies were wrong.
Cooper leads McCrory statewide by 9,800 votes with a handful of counties yet to complete their counting. Cooper has declared himself the winner and his campaign says McCrory should concede. McCrory could still seek a statewide recount if he trails by Cooper by 10,000 votes or less.
