Centre-right favourites to take Swedish general election
Sweden goes to the polls on Sunday with the centre-right coalition of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt predicted to win a new term of office.
Reinfeldt’s four party Alliance coalition proposes cuts to income tax to be funded by a slimming downof the welfare state. He warned his supporters against complacency, saying a lot of voters make their choice at the last minute.
The Social Democrats are led by Mona Sahlin, who would become Sweden’s first ever female prime minister were she to win. Her party proposes greater investment in schools, hospitals and care for the elderly, paid for by increased taxes on high wage earners.
Support for Jimie Aakesson’s anti-immigration Sweden Democrats is hovering around the 4 pour cent threshhold required for entering the 349 seat parliament. If the far right grouping does win the balance of power it will complicate the post election negotiations – both major blocs have ruled out co-operating with it.
