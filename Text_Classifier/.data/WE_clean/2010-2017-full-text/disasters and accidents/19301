Mayon volcano spewing lava forces hurried Philippines evacuations
Philippines authorities say they have evacuated thousands of people from the edges of a volcano that's on the verge of erupting.
Albay province governor Joey Salceda says almost 7,000 families living around Mayon volcano have been evacuated.
About 400 families still need to be moved to safer ground.
Security forces will set up checkpoints to prevent people from breaching the danger zone around the volcano.
Evacuation sites, however, have been crowded, with people facing problems such as a lack of water supply and health and sanitation issues.
Lava cascaded down the Philippines' most active volcano on Wednesday, two days after authorities raised the third highest alert in a five-step scale, meaning a full-scale eruption is possible "within weeks".
The volcano's world-renowned perfect cone appeared to have been deformed and swollen with lava that had risen from the Earth's core.
