N. Korea imports luxury goods for ruling elites despite food shortages
SEOUL, June 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korea has continued its shopping spree for Armani, Gucci and other luxury goods for its ruling elites, a South Korean official said Wednesday, the latest sign that international sanctions on the North have not been fully implemented. The U.N. sanctions imposed on Pyongyang for its nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 ban the communist country from trading in weapons of mass destruction, some conventional weapons and luxury goods.
