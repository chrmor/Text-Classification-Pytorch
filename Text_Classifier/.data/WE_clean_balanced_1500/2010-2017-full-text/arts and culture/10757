Zsa Zsa Gabor celebrates her 95th birthday at home
Hungarian-born actress and socialite Zsa Zsa Gabor turned 95 years old Monday (February 06), a surprising milestone given her string of health scares in recent years. Gabor has been in and out of hospitals numerous times since July 2010, when she fell out of bed and broke her hip. In January of 2011, doctors amputated a portion of her leg, in February of that year, she was treated for a lung infection, and most recently, in November she was rushed to the hospital after complications arose from her feeding tube. At her birthday party, Gabor, from a hospice bed in her Bel Air home, blew out candles on a chocolate cake with husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, and other guests including TV host Larry King.
