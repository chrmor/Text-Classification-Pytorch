Sukna land scam: Lt Gen  P K Rath found guilty
The court martial is being held since September last, and was convened with Lt. Gen. IP Singh as the presiding officer following the army's decision early last year to try P K Rath in the case. The court martial, headed by a panel of five lieutenant generals headed by Lt. Gen. I P Singh, delivered its judgment here after about an eight-month-long hearing in the case. The land scam came into the open in mid-2008 and the names of Avadesh Prakash and P K Rath figured among the senior army officers who influenced the decision to issue the no-objection certificate (NOC) to a Siliguri-based private builder to construct an educational institution on a 70-acre land adjacent to the Sukna military station in West Bengal. The army had ordered a court of inquiry into the Sukna land scam in late 2008, following which former army chief General Deepak Kapoor decided to take minor administrative action as punishment to these officers in early 2009.
