The Scream fetches record price at auction
One of the art world's most recognisable images - Edvard Munch's The Scream has been sold for a record $US119,922,500 ($A116.59 million) at auction in New York City.
The 1895 artwork - a modern symbol of human anxiety - was sold at Sotheby's. The price includes the buyer's premium.
The image of a man holding his head and screaming under a streaked, blood-red sky is one of four versions by the Norwegian expressionist painter. The auctioned piece at Sotheby's is the only one left in private hands.
The previous record for an artwork sold at auction was $106.5 million for Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves, and Bust, sold by Christie's in 2010.
The image has become part of pop culture, "used by everyone from Warhol to Hollywood to cartoons to teacups and T-shirts," said Michael Frahm of the London-based art advisory service firm Frahm Ltd.
"Together with the Mona Lisa, it's the most famous and recognised image in art history," he said.
