Two suspected U.S. drone strikes kill 19 in Pakistan
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants and 13 people respectively on Monday, intelligence officials told CNN.
Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the first suspected drone fired two missiles on a militants' vehicle in the Shawal area of South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan.
The second suspected drone strike targeted a hideout in the Wana area, also in South Waziristan.
Based on a count by the CNN Islamabad bureau, Monday's suspected drone strikes were the 37th and 38th this year, compared to 111 in all of 2010.
The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
