3 impeach raps vs Aquino sufficient in form
MANILA, Philippines - The House of Representatives Committee on Justice on Tuesday declared the three impeachment complaints filed against President Benigno Aquino III to be sufficient in form.
Fifty-three House members who attended the televised committee hearing voted in favor of the first complaint. There were only one negative vote and one abstention.
The second complaint received 42 affirmative votes, seven negative votes and four abstentions.
The third complaint was immediately declared sufficient in form since no lawmaker objected to it.
Aquino's first impeachment case that was filed on July 21 alleged that the President committed culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust for the controversial Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) of his administration.
The complaint was signed by 28 individuals and was endorsed by party-list lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc.
The second complaint was filed by youth groups on July 22 and was endorsed by Kabataan Party-list Representative Terry Ridon. It accused the President of betrayal of public trust and graft and corruption over the DAP, which was declared partially unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
The third complaint accused Aquino of culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust for entering into a military agreement with the United States or the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.
ACT Teachers and Gabriela Party-lists Representatives Antonio Tinio and Emmi de Jesus filed and endorsed the complaint.
Iloilo Rep. Neil Tupas, chair of the House committee on justice, said the next hearing on the impeach complaints will be held next Tuesday, September 2.
Tupas said the next hearing will determine if the three impeachment complaints are sufficient in substance.
