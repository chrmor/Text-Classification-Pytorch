Closure of The Global Herald
In August 2017, the company which owns Silicon Dales closed down a WordPress based free online news site, which was held at TheGlobalHerald.com.
As this was a news website, the content was removed at this time and that domain was redirected to here, silicondales.com.
Any visitors who land looking for content at The Global Herald will be shown this page, to inform them that the website is no longer active.
After 10 years of providing free access to news and opinion from experts, academics and authority sources, it was time to shelve the project.
We hope you enjoyed the website.
