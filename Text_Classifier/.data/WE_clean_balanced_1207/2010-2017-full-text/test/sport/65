Mariusz Wach on Steroids
"Wach did not fall easily," said Klitschko after the fight. "And I did everything I could."
When big, bad Mariusz Wach fought Wladimir Klitschko in Hamburg on Nov. 10, he promised to blow the house down. He did not. He managed to last the 12-round distance and absorbed untold shots to the face and head. But the Viking Warrior to his credit didn’t fold.
“Mariusz Wach did not fall easily,” said Klitschko after the fight. “And I did everything I could.”
According to Bild, Thomas Puetz, President of the Federation of German Professional Boxing, “We investigated the samples of both boxers from the Cologne Institute for Biochemistry. We were notified that a sample is positive.”
That was the A sample belonging to Mariusz Wach.
Before the test results were announced, the German press were respectfully calling Wach “Kinn Kong,” which sounds better in German than English (“Chin Kong”).
There’s no telling what they will call him now.
Should the results of the B sample come back positive, Chin Kong faces a one-year suspension.
